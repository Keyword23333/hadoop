4270382 one source says apple programmed the infineon chip to demand a more powerful 3g signal than the iphone really requires so if too many people try to make a call or go on the internet in a given area some of the devices will decide theres insufficient power and switch to the slower network even if there is enough 3g bandwidth available

4270393 het georgische volk is nu sterk verenigd in zijn oppositie tegen de russische onderdrukking maar ik hoor toch ook veel mensen die wijzen op de zware verantwoordelijkheid die de regering saakasjvili draagt voor wat er gebeurd is velen wilden deze oorlog niet er is wel kritiek maar in stilte en niet openlijk
4270394 er is geen echte oppositie die een kritisch geluid kan laten horen dat geldt ook voor de media die zich sinds 2004 allerlei niet offici le restricties hebben laten opleggen door de regering en natuurlijk wil op dit moment niemand anti patriottisch overkomen
4270395 veel georgi rs weten nu nog niet wat er echt gebeurd is de meesten willen bijvoorbeeld niet geloven dat wij zoveel verwoestingen hebben aangericht in de zuid ossetische hoofdstad tschinvali mensen weten ook niet hoeveel slachtoffers er werkelijk zijn gevallen als straks de propaganda weg is en de feiten duidelijk worden dan zal er een zondebok worden gezocht

4270402 measure patients waistlines and use the waist to hip ratio to estimate stroke risk world health organization defined categories of waist to hip ratio or waist circumference should be used
4270403 the whole vascular risk profile to minimize or modify all possible factors contributing to coronary heart disease stroke and peripheral artery disease
4270404 if the waist to hip ratio values were greater than 0 97 for men and 0 84 for women then individuals faced almost eight times increased risk for stroke compared to individuals with a waist to hip ratio less than 0 92 in men or less than 0 78 in women
4270405 is an appropriate measure to assess the risk of stroke and tia comparable to waist circumference
4270406 by using different statistical approaches it was confirmed that waist to hip ratio appeared to be the strongest predictor of stroke and tia risk

4270408 the paper highlights a real dilemma we have today in diabetes treatment
4270409 we have drugs that lower glucose but we seem to run into problems over time with improving outcomes particularly cardiovascular outcomes
4270410 is whether it is due to the disease or the drugs increasing cardiovascular risk
4270411 that there is some increased risk with this combination that is the most widely used diabetes treatment of two drugs that are cheap and generic
4270412 clearly demonstrate that further studies are needed not only to assess the association of combination therapy of metformin and sulfonylurea with all cause and or cardiovascular mortality but also to understand the potential underlying mechanism of its effects
4270413 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
4270414 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat

4270444 in non technical terms the court has held that free licences set conditions on the use of copyrighted work when you violate the condition the licence disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer
4270445 determined that the terms of the artistic license are enforceable copyright conditions
4270446 copyright holders who engage in open source licensing have the right to control the modification and distribution of copyrighted materials
4270447 open source licensing has become a widely used method of creative collaboration that serves to advance the arts and sciences in a manner and at a pace few could have imagined just a few decades ago
4270448 although the reasoning is limited to the artistic licence and the interpretation of each open source licence will depend on the wording of its provisions this decision is a welcome change
4270449 the federal court recognised that even though licensors give up some rights it doesnt mean they have any less rights to access the remedies our law provides
4270450 this opinion demonstrates a strong understanding of a basic economic principle of the internet that even though money doesnt change hands attribution is a valuable economic right in the information economy

4270495 these lakes are fed by hydrothermal waters that leach out arsenic containing minerals from the surrounding rocks
4270496 we suspected that these bacteria were using arsenic to make a living so we scraped the biofilms off the rock and studied them under laboratory conditions

4270505 i love you and i am very proud of you
4270506 why does the gemara in taanis 26 state that there were no holidays like the fifteenth of av and yom kippur why is the fifteenth of av compared to yom kippur the holiest day of the year also why isnt yom kippur mentioned first
4270507 this is hinting that the days of teshuva begin on the fifteenth of av and extend all the way to yom kippur as he famous saying goes av is an acronym that spells elul bah elul is on its way anyone who can arouse themselves to repent during these days of mercy should do so anyone who cant should at least do so by contemplating the merit of their righteous ancestors this will also work well however someone who simply cannot arouse himself to teshuva on the fifteenth of av should take a different hint from the gemara it tells us that the custom was that they would borrow clothes one from the other if a person feels uninspired to repent he should borrow inspiration from his friend or teacher who does feel aroused to change let such a person ask someone inspired what awakened him until he feels like he is beginning to wake up spiritually and start to do teshuva
4270508 there were no days for the jewish people that could compare to the fifteenth of av the gemara is very clear that people would make matches on that day so we see that one needs a very special measure of assistance from above to merit to make good shidduchim for oneself and ones children we should not take this for granted shidduchim are not a simple matter at all
4270509 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues

4270536 the greater fear right now is missing the next big rally
4270537 inflation numbers were bad but they are probably going to get better
4270538 investors have different opinions as to what the value of those companies are given the tremendous difficulties they face
4270539 for me it wont be the anxiety of oh my god we have to make this race its a big deal for at least one week
4270540 but were only in the top 35 by eight points and i dont want to say were good
4270541 all it takes is one little mistake mechanical or driver error and were right back out friday will definitely be a much better day this week but we want to keep building on the momentum
4270542 i dont want to just be in the top 35 i want to keep looking forward
4270543 i wanted to keep the pain to myself son but now it cuts straight through me do you understand it cuts straight through me
4270544 i found that even 2 500 years ago sophocles was using words like shell shocked and the thousand yard stare those are things that you hear today
4270545 i know its a bit odd to have greek plays read to a conference of military people
4270546 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization
4270547 we know that greek drama was theater for combat veterans by combat veterans

4270550 spanish was my first language so mrs becky mcdonald made sure ive got a few hispanic kids
4270551 if the freshmen have a problem theyll know who to call and the link leaders will be checking up on their crews
4270552 when elderly people complain theyre tired most doctors say yeah well youre old they tell their patients that feeling listless is an expected part of aging but there are reasons people are tired and they need to be investigated for clinicians the message from our study is that a lack of energy is widespread in the elderly but its not normal
4270553 i believe anergia is the universal language by which the elderly talk about their health problems
4270554 instead of noting symptoms of pain or a depressed mood many older adults feel more comfortable telling their physicians that they are tired as health care providers we need to start learning how to further identify the underlying causes of this lack of vigor and address them
4270555 as our population ages it has become paramount to the health of our nation to accurately describe the health problems associated with age
4270556 a central feature of the frailty phenotype that we described years ago is self reported exhaustion the current study suggests that this concern expressed by patients or their caregivers is important and may be a very useful question in identifying older adults susceptible to functional decline and poor health outcomes
4270557 i dont like labels cant we just hang out and have sex at my leisure

4270559 the battering of consumers continues as prices are rising for just about everything
4270560 it is certainly above expectations here but i think weve probably seen for the near term anyway the worst of the inflation readings
4270561 it will take some time for the economy to turn around but we are confident in the long term fundamentals and underlying strength of our economy to get us through this period
4270562 families have now lost an entire decades worth of raises to inflation

4270578 the best way to get better is to play great teams in the conference and outside the conference the schedule is tough but balanced as a first year program we are going to head in the most balanced and competitive direction from the start and build on this from season to season in order to be the best you need to play the best both in the conference and on a national level it is the only way to gain the respect of the lacrosse community

4270586 horses like prodigious who have raced past their ability to participate in a second career others who need to be rescued from extremely neglectful situations often one or two owners removed from their racetrack career and those others just needing an expert hand to redirect them into a successful second career deserve the financial support of the industry

4270589 barack obama has also been quoted as saying he would perhaps delay his payroll tax increase if he thought it would harm people in the current economy in his discussion now about delaying it for 10 years suggests to me that his economic advisers have told him that increasing the payroll tax is actually not good to do in a weak economy the reality is that if an increase in the payroll tax is not good now its not good ever i dont know how he could predict the state of the economy ten years from now
4270590 the reality of barack obamas record is the following he has voted to raise taxes 94 times in his short time as a senator
4270591 voted to raise taxes on people making as little as 42 000 a year
4270592 t drukud kui te sellega paigastki saate on teil pool eksamit juba tehtud
4270593 were friends i havent stopped being his friend if he asks me id give it to him
4270594 we have leaders who are doing too much whining and not enough leading
4270595 the debate has become highly politicized and has spilled over from geology journals to the mainstream press and to the fora and mailing lists on the internet the proponents of the abiotic oil theory are often very aggressive in their arguments some of them go so far as to accuse those who claim that oil production is going to peak of pursuing a hidden political agenda designed to provide bush with a convenient excuse for invading iraq and the whole middle east normally the discussion of abiotic oil oscillates between the scientifically arcane and the politically nasty even supposing that the political nastiness can be detected and removed there remains the problem that the average non specialist in petroleum geology cant hope to wade through the arcane scientific details of the theory isotopic ratios biomarkers sedimentary layers and all that without getting lost
4270596 it was just one of those games were just gonna ignore it and move on like it didnt happen
4270597 there will be a whole host of readers looking forward to the latest release by susan johnson readers who have enjoyed her work since messages from chaos 20 years ago or readers who joined in more recently for her painful memoir a better woman or for her novel inspired by the life of charmian clift the broken book johnson has shown substantial breadth she has a knack for presenting what can be unbearable in reality of rendering it on the page with tremendous heart making it readable and going one step further somehow managing to make it enjoyable
4270598 gilling knows sydney well and has a fine insight into that shadowy world where public and private lives collide in the media the boardroom and the courtroom his characters are believable ordinary people placed in extraordinary situations and he tells a good story i loved this novel from the beginning to the very last page unfortunately i felt badly betrayed by the ending and desperately wanted more apart from that small disappointment this is an accomplished novel from a very talented australian author
4270599 nixs series has developed a deservedly loyal following that has impatiently awaited each installment these are books that can easily take repeated readings theres so much detail in each one that its hard to take in all at once for better or for worse however its not a series that can be read out of order instead readers need to take the time to wade through each volume to truly understand whats going on
4270600 its a wonderful if slightly worthy warts and all account that fans will find fascinating
4270601 a multitude of underlying plotlines personal dramas and secret histories bubble just beneath the surface and disquiet could easily have evolved into a weighty family saga yet the things we dont discover carry the same weight as those we do
4270602 bradley has tamed the scattershot plotting of his earlier work into a prose of neat vignettes catching the gore of the mortuary slab and the seedy high of the opium den
4270603 its one of those books that hums quietly along even though extraodinary things may happen it really does feel like an everyday kind of travel it just pulls you along as the characters journey through life thats what i loved about it the writing the writing was quite lovely
4270604 one aspect of stevens writing amazes me and that is his wonderful talent of being able to deliver the ending to a story before its truly begun without losing the reader i am not sure if other people would find this delightful as i do or irritating and indeed in other books i have found the looking forward such as this would be a moment they would remember for years to come or this single moment jack would ponder many times in his future to be an annoying way of underlining text to ensure the reader knows its important but in this story i found it charming in an odd way it is like being let in on a secret that only you and the author share
4270605 theres been a lot of irrational hate generated toward someone who hasnt been able to show what i think hes capable of doing its not like everett struck out four times and dropped a key relay throw in the 12th and was late getting to first base according to the royals radio crew on bakers error
4270606 geees maybe the best baseball has yet to be played
4270607 its not like gardy wanted to use guerrier in that situation
4270608 as for the rest of it its only one game i guess
4270609 no one wanted to hear it two weeks ago when i said they should have kept livan moved perkins to the pen
4270610 who can come in with guys on base and keep a lead to get to the 9th inning
4270611 we dont have access to bill smith i assume you do
4270612 bradford averages a strike out about every 2 3 innings not a quality reliever by my definition
4270613 wow you really are just a troll arent you i tried to give you the benefit of the doubt but its pretty obvious
4270614 the managing and pitching did not lose the game a lack of patience at the plate and a lack of an ability
4270615 romer i think the point jc is trying to make
4270616 he could be useful in a middle innings situation but again twins have two or three guys that can handle that already
4270617 lsklingen kan du stoppa undan citro n broschyren n r vi r h r inne
4270618 it cost us the game you can slice it and dice it any way you want it it cost us the game ill take that one for the team for sure
4270619 you werent the only one who messed up sunday look at kubel and gomez and delmon they went 0 for 11
4270620 you guys should jump on my back tonight im going to carry us
4270621 nah we need more veteran hitters like dougie b in our lineup because this team is definately a left handed platoon player away from the playoffs
4270622 thats right romer so how can you explain opposing pitchers who consistently pitch around morneau to get to kubel
4270623 of course theres no comparison since morneau plays every day while kubel sits against formidible lefties
4270624 my odds of giving up runs by pitching to the next guy are better than if i pitch to morneau
4270625 what remains to be seen is who will have more extra base hits by seasons end kubel or chicago white sox second baseman alexei ramirez
4270626 hey jason i liked it better when you were whining about mauer batting third at least then you tried to use statistics instead of blind bias
4270627 of course theres no comparison since morneau plays every day while kubel sits against formidible lefties
4270628 hes not actually so bad against lhers that he automatically needs to be pinchhit everytime after all last year his ops v lh was 667 which isnt horribly horrible and hes been really unlucky this year why his babip vs lh is 180 which is extremely unlucky and we can expect significant regression
4270629 complaining about the 5 hole hitter and lack of protection behind dr morneau is just nitpicking
4270630 on the other hand you have many people wishing including bill smith on sunday morning cuddy would return to occupy the five spot in our lineup reason what we have there isnt getting it done
4270631 but at least with jacques we got a season of 300 27 hr 85 rbi so my question is is this too much to ask for of kubes or are we supposed to remain quiet and accept what we have
4270632 im too lazy to look it up but somewhere in the neighborhood of 150 not good even by punto induced lower standards
4270633 when posters suggest that those who disagree with their thoughts on the 5 hitter should leave the country
4270634 in all three cases 87 06 and now the twins had have a chance at some dynasty
4270635 the 88 twins won 91 games and still finished 13 games out of the playoffs it makes no difference who they got for brunansky they wouldnt have made up 13 games
4270636 the 88 twins won 91 games and still finished 13 games out of the playoffs
4270637 id never wish harm on anyone or want to see them get hurt
4270638 we win as a team and we lose as a team
4270639 thats why its a good thing the media has aboslutely no power over the roster unlike in new york
4270640 thats where i think the media is sometimes accurate in their discussions of how punto is viewed by the fan base yep he sucks but even when everybody sucks hes somehow singled out it really is riddiculous you cant pin this loss squarely on puntos one error
4270641 t brought up a great point it happens apparently about kubels inability to give justin morneau any lineup protection
4270642 this is supposed to be kubels time to shine a stretch of games where he plays everyday for about a week and a half so we better start seeing some shining against the yanks
4270643 kubel is still their third best hitter maybe 4th if span maintains this obp he had a bad day the issue is that young isnt good enough to make up for it when kubes has a bad day most of the time
4270644 the angels playing smarter wouldnt have any bearing on the managerial skills of the 2 clubs now would it
4270645 other than the fact that i doubt the angels have lost 2 of 3 to seattle at any point this year
4270646 i contend you cannot assume your players will get better faster than your opponents players
4270647 so you can cite these dh stats all you want but the fact is kubel is not good enough to protect morneau in the lineup
4270648 nothing is guaranteed but i am happy that i invested in a 401k even though i did have many chances to die young
4270649 yeah cause he was on fire last year when he hit in the 8 and 9 holes way to dodge the numbers from this year quite artfully even
4270650 just you wait hes going to be an awesome hitter minor league stats this hits balls hard that etc
4270651 why are you complaining about kubel look at his numbers hes a decent dh
4270652 pete d i wont go through it all again i can read statistics just like everyone else as i said at the outset with kubel the statistics show a solid no 7 hitter its been that way forever the twins were hoping he would upgrade to a 3 or 5 hasnt happened
4270653 hes on pace for pretty much the same slugging and rbi total as a year ago hes hitting 9 points lower i dont see the need to defend that against criticism
4270654 punto everett and lamb are bench players under no circumstances should should more than one of them be allowed on the field at the same time
4270655 youll still call for gardys head when he took a team that was supposed to be the worst in the central and turned them into a contender youll still call for vavras head after the kind of offense theyve been putting together
4270656 the twins are getting poor w l results because theyre only producing 6 7 hits a game
4270657 they sucked at the plate and in the field yesterday it happens
4270658 bill smith did try to get beltre the price was too high you dismissed that as an excuse
4270659 hopefully the twins will do better against him tonight than previously
4270660 either smith is stupid for not signing enough fa veterans or hes stupid for signing any at all when he should have somehow
4270661 often youll hear people lament that baseball is a business but why its like every other organization in life trying to allocate its resources most efficiently
4270662 the pinstriped coffins have been delivered and when the final game at yankee stadium is played it likely will be turned into a cemetery the headstone will read march 31 aug 13 looking to build on a stirring victory tuesday night the yankees ended a 10 game road trip with a sloppy 4 2 loss to the twins in front of 35 187 at the metrodome the voyage through texas california and minnesota ended 3 7 and the finale was repulsive
4270663 you saved our traveling party from having to negotiate joint custody of the one gura that we were able to scrounge up after saturdays game
4270664 maybe chief has to come and grab somebody in his neck and pin them to the wall im very close to doing that so write that down
4270665 meche is pitching effectively inside for the first time in his eight year career it required a new approach that is only now starting to feel comfortable but the results are undeniable
4270666 if he keeps hitting em do we hafta refer to his jacks as
4270667 thank god bert is half insane he makes the telecasts bearable with his sometimes bizaare out of the blue statements
4270668 royals representative toby cook described tonights bobblehead larry gura a great left hander who had this interesting little leg kick with his right leg and down here you see a pot of honey
4270669 you could probably make the same argument for most teams after 1994 players are much more mobile than before and it is rare for someone who is a big home run hitter to stay with the same team after his years of team control are over
4270670 aside from 2006 the lack of power has done alright in terms of getting the twins to the playoffs in the gardy era
4270671 the dark gods march in step and i shall deliver them this world for their pleasure

4270698 in non technical terms the court has held that free licences set conditions on the use of copyrighted work when you violate the condition the licence disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer
4270699 determined that the terms of the artistic license are enforceable copyright conditions
4270700 copyright holders who engage in open source licensing have the right to control the modification and distribution of copyrighted materials
4270701 open source licensing has become a widely used method of creative collaboration that serves to advance the arts and sciences in a manner and at a pace few could have imagined just a few decades ago
4270702 although the reasoning is limited to the artistic licence and the interpretation of each open source licence will depend on the wording of its provisions this decision is a welcome change
4270703 the federal court recognised that even though licensors give up some rights it doesnt mean they have any less rights to access the remedies our law provides
4270704 this opinion demonstrates a strong understanding of a basic economic principle of the internet that even though money doesnt change hands attribution is a valuable economic right in the information economy

4270894 cap does not want to give directions bumps into you as youre walking believe me its no accident
4270895 i can remember the time you hurt me but i do not feeling the hurt anymore
4270896 looking good today when you gonna let me take you out for a fish sandwich
4270897 i shouldve ate a big mac or some fries because with my yogurt i just ate im going to be sooo hungry the rest of the day and i need to be full
4270898 i guess i should have asked why are you throwing starfish in the ocean
4270899 the sun is up and the tide is going out and if i dont throw them in theyll die
4270900 but young man dont you realize that there are miles and miles of beach and starfish all along it you cant possibly make a difference
4270901 i also saw the al qaeda training camp north of baghdad that had been abandoned but it was stark evidence of the strong links between the iraqi dictator and osama bin ladens would be warriors some fo the guys who had been in afghanistan said it was just about a direct replica of the camp the united states destroyed after 9 11
4270902 i was more acutely aware of a growing problem which faces u s forces on active duty in theaters of war all over the world for me it began in iraq the first mumurings from the liberal part of the u s a that we were somehow in the wrong brutal killers bulllying other countries that we who put our lives on the line for our nation at the behest of our government should somehow be charged with murder or shooting our enemy its been an insidious progression the criticisms of the u s armed forces from politicians and from the liberal media which knows nothing of combat nothing of our training and nothing of the mortal dangers we face out there on the front line
4270903 and those roe rules of engagement are very specific we may not open fire until we are fired upon or have positively identified our enemy and have proof of his intentions now thats all very gallant but how about a group of u s soldiers who have been on patrol for several days have been fired upon have dodged rocket propelled grenades and homemade bombs have sustained casualties and who are very nearly exhausted and maybe slighty scared how about when a bunch of guys wearing colored towels around their heads and brandishing ak 47s come charging over the horizon straight toward you do you wait for them to start killing your team or do you mow the bastards down before they get a chance to do so that situation might look simple in washington where the human rights of terrorists are often given high priority and i am certain liberal politicians would defend their positon to the death because everyone knows liberals have never been wrong about anything you can ask them anytime
4270904 i promise you every insurgent freedom fighter and stray gunman in iraq who we arrested knew the ropes knew that the way out was to announce he had been tortured by the americans ill treated or prevented from reading the koran or eating his breakfast or watching the television they all knew al jazeera the arab broadcasters would pick it up and it would be relayed to the u s a where the liberal media would joyfully accuse all of us of being murderers or barbarians or something those terrorist organizations laugh at the u s media and they know exactly how to use the system against us
4270905 i know one thing for certain if i ever rounded a mountainside in afghanistan and came face to face with osama bin laden the man who masterminded the vicious unprovoked attack on my country killing 2 752 innocent american civilians in new york on 9 11 id shoot him dead in cold blood at which point urged on by an outraged american media the military would probably incarcerated me under the jail nver mind in it and then id be charged with murder tell you what id still shoot the sonofabitch
4270906 we dont know at this point was is going to happen

4270958 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4270959 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4270960 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4270967 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4270968 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4270969 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town

4271065 the earths biosphere permeates with microorganisms and their bi products s j mattingly and l a garza valdes of texas university at san antonio have been studying the plastic like biogenic varnishes covering all exposed surfaces unlike the phenomena causing c 14 testing to date too old these coating cause artifacts to date too young an example of this has now been confirmed on the shroud of turin where microscopic examination of some of the shrouds fibers revealed this varnish this invalidates the c 14 test which reported the shroud to be only 700 years old
4271066 the theoretical effect of the earths recent envelopment by a molecular cloud on the accuracy of carbon dating encourages us to check the potential distortion caused by the ingestion of primordial carbon carbon 13
4271067 primordial carbon c 13 comes from limestone and natural gas secreting up from the earths interior
4271068 even animals eating these apparently ancient life forms will take up their carbon 13 and in effect be drained of carbon 14
4271069 of course no one would be confused if c 13 does not endanger archaeological dating but the professor admits the c 13 mice not only can but would confuse radiometric dating in an archaeological dig in practice that missing electron in c 13 is harder to detect than expected

4271351 which i had picked up on a shareware floppy from a dollar store one day while shopping with my parents i was taken by it immediately i could notate down melodies and endlessly tinker with them as well as input musical notation that was too complex for me to play on the piano at the time i continued drafting songs in piano roll notation programs for a few years but it wasnt until i discovered trackers at age 11 that things really started to develop i learned how to track while attending a technology focused summer camp at the university of carleton in 1997 one of the mini lessons which kids could choose to attend was how to use impulse tracker and i remember basically being taught one on one by the instructor learning the ropes and some basic techniques whoever this instructor was id love to shake his hand today as soon as i discovered the tracker music scene and demo scene i became addicted to downloading other artists modules and examing how they had constructed their tracks that was the beauty of the tracker scene really all of the music was open source every note sample rhythm and programming trick could be examined by anyone that high degree of transparency enabled me to become competant at tracking within a relatively short period of time by 1999 i was making releases on tracker netlabels and even running one of my own moodmat do you still work primarily with tracker software or are you composing with other tools now ilkae i still work almost entirely with tracker software to be honest i cant dream of sequencing music any other way after 10 years of tracking it just feels so natural ive come to love the weird quirks of the platform while accepting its flaws moodmat do you expect youll be working with krystian lubiszewski again or is he permanently off doing other things ilkae i would love to write more music with krystian someday but as far as i know he has been musically inactive since 2002 or so when he entered university i know that relatively recently he received a masters degree in a science discipline so perhaps with school behind him hell find the time to rediscover music i really miss collaborating with him with two people there were always twice as many ideas and half as many roadblocks i learned a lot from sending modules back and forth with krystian and ive tried to keep some of his style of writing alive with my own work quite often if im stumped ill turn to krystians unreleased miniatures for inspiration moodmat how much did the merck shutdown affect ilkae from a commercial standpoint they had deals with larger distributors both physical and download stores e g itunes emusic do you find its easier going direct with cd r releases than dealing with a physical label ilkae to be honest there never has been much of a commercial standpoint with ilkae if financial viability was a primary concern of mine i imagine id be writing electro or house music certainly there was a wider range of exposure involved with making releases on merck which i definitely miss but its because of those merck releases that theres any interest in my cd rs at all for the time being im comfortable with doing limited run cd rs with self published works its a lot easier to get things out there shortly after they are completed with a conventional record label the amount of time which passes between submitting an album and it being released can be anywhere between 6 months and over a year not having to deal with that is nice moodmat youve done quite a few downloadable releases with various netlabels and a pretty large proportion of your material is available as legal free downloads anything youd like to mention here in particular www inpuj net in the coming weeks theres also a pair of 20 minute long electroacoustic pieces sitting online here moodmat light industry seems a bit darker sonically than some of your earlier releases to this listener was this a conscious decision on your part ilkae initially no the music on light industry spans from late 2004 to early 2008 and over those years i grew up a lot and definitely went through some pretty bad and hilarious rough patches im sure that it comes through in my work because music functions something akin to therapy for me its a way of getting moods or emotions worked out of my system via creating them in audio form darker times result in darker pieces in the final stages of planning the album i decided not to dilute the melancholy of the core pieces with the inclusion of more upbeat or erratic tracks instead deciding to save those for a subsequent release ampersand

4271406 i love mr bernardo and when he asked me to be on a committee to honor katrina survivors there was no mention of the mayor and no mention of me being co chair
4271407 i dont think we ought to be honoring the mayor
4271408 i think if were honoring anybody it ought to start with the survivors of the storm and then the first responders then the neighborhood and faith based leaders not the government not the government
4271409 i am not disassociating myself from honoring survivors not from katrina ceremonies not from celebrating the third anniversary of the storm and not from bernardo i am definitely disassociating myself from honoring the mayor

4271447 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4271448 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4271449 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4271450 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4271451 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4271452 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4271453 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4271454 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4271455 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4271456 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4271457 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4271458 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4271459 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4271460 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4271461 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4271462 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4271463 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4271464 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4271465 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4271466 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4271467 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4271468 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4271469 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4271470 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4271471 both represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7

4271473 we as a team definitely learned some lessons about disclosure and how we can all too easily get ahead of ourselves in talking about features before our understanding of them is solid
4271474 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk

4271480 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4271481 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4271482 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4271483 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4271484 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4271485 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4271486 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4271487 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4271488 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4271489 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4271490 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4271491 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4271492 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4271493 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4271494 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4271495 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4271496 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4271497 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4271498 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4271499 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4271500 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4271501 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4271502 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4271503 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4271504 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4271505 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4271506 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4271507 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4271508 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4271509 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4271510 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4271511 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4271512 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4271513 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4271514 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4271515 we needed to be more dynamic we needed a bit more personality on the field of play
4271516 i thought midtjylland were excellent a big strong team who understood the counter attack game very well
4271517 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4271518 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4271519 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4271520 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4271521 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4271522 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4271523 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4271524 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4271525 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4271526 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4271527 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4271528 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4271529 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4271530 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4271531 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4271532 who are open to doing something on the production side
4271533 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4271534 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4271535 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4271536 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4271537 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4271538 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4271539 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4271540 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4271541 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4271542 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4271543 we would be going back to someone who resigned in some disgrace it would look like desperation henry would be a retread and if people think the snp would go easier on him they must be joking
4271544 if he by some miracle won and became the mp for glenrothes he would have to find some nationalist to have dinner with every night in the commons because no labour mp would
4271545 perhaps we were a little bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse
4271546 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do
4271547 in the first half we had too many unforced errors and needed to play in their half and not get trapped in our half which is what happened in the second half they put people behind the ball and played on the break which they did very well
4271548 we needed to be dynamic and show more personality and drive the play fair play to the opposition though they understand the counter attack game and executed it well
4271549 we are short of a few players and are a bit light so were still in the market for players the match is only at half time

4271559 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4271560 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4271561 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4271562 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4271563 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4271564 our team has been working closely with netelixir over the last year and right out of the gate they improved our internal efforts by 60 this with their ability to build a dedicated team to support our grocery cpa program 24 7 365 has given mywebgrocer a significant advantage to our retailers who are competing against wal mart target and amazons massive ppc efforts
4271565 our partnership drives significant efficiency in the search advertising management program for online retailers

4271585 weve done several search warrants here locally weve worked with the secret service on several of them
4271586 its a result of just progress in the printing industry and what modern printers can do
4271587 these are too hard to replicate these are the new money we have now they older money is what they try to reproduce
4271588 we check every big bill that comes in 20 50 and 100 we have a pen and we make a mark if the mark stays yellow its a good bill if the mark turns black we dont accept it
4271589 for a little business like this even 50 is a lot of money when people come in here and use these
4271590 hes hurting everybody i mean everythings going up and costing more because youre making counterfeit money nothings really free
4271591 if we do get close to an alligator just dont stick your hand in the water

4271597 courage is not the absence of fear but rather the judgment that something else is more important than fear

4271604 its smelling to high heaven like a hoax they can claim to have dna but its not going to be possible for them to prove through dna analysis that they have bigfoot because theres no specimen in a jar that says this is bigfoot to match it to
4271605 and the video itll be whats known in the bigfoot research community as a blobsquatch an indeterminate dark blob that may or may not be a man a bear a bigfoot an elf a dragon who knows
4271606 ive had interactions with tom biscardi a well known bigfoot hunter who is holding the press conference in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
4271607 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect

4271616 the promise of racetrack memory for example the ability to carry massive amounts of information in your pocket could unleash creativity leading to devices and applications that nobody has imagined yet
4271617 dr parkin said that racetrack memory could lead to the development of three dimensional micro electronics breaking with the tradition of scientists trying to fit an ever greater number on transistors on an ultra thin piece of silicon shaped like a wafer
4271618 bpi technicians will trace illegal music downloads to individual virgin media accounts and hand over account details to the broadband supplier matching them to names and addresses
4271619 the record labels have been pressing for a three strikes policy that would see a letter warning customers they are committing an offence followed by suspension for a second offence a third strike would see illegal downloaders having their accounts disconnected
4271620 six million broadband users are thought to engage in the illegal download of files each year which record labels claim are costing them billions of pounds in lost cd sales

4271647 we felt it was too serious an issue to be put on television portrayed as fact what was in fact fiction
4271648 we made clear that it would have been grossly irresponsible to air this movie in its original and ideologically driven form
4271649 i havent gotten any indication this is ever going to be seen again

4271658 its a shame you kids on punishment an cant come out an play
4271659 ive got my automobile nearby we could go to a restaurant have a bite to eat and then maybe swing back to my apartment for coffee a little bustello some good music perhaps a glass or two of wine maybe roll up a few drinks it could have been a nice little set a very pleasurable experience
4271660 what about air conditioning you got air this place never heard of air conditioning and its so hot up in here
4271661 its so hot inside its a shame you cant come up here and take me some where else baby

4271664 consumers will accept an awful lot if you let them know what they are accepting

4271673 we ended up doing all the songs their kids loved in the 60s instead
4271674 if we do attack it is going to be a disaster
4271675 i was astounded to see on one of the networks the other day that the debate was not are we going to attack but are we going to attack before or after the election
4271676 if that comes up it is demanding that the president put in place an absolute blockade of the entire country of iran and punish any country or any business group around the world if they trade with iran
4271677 the frightening thing is they say they are taking no options off the table even nuclear first strike
4271678 that is my sense because the democratic leaders in the house are proposing no resistance whatsoever paul said
4271679 we saw this when a supplemental bill came up and the president asked for 107 billion for the war the democrat leadership gave them 162 billion
4271680 it is still totally bewildering to me when i see men and women in the congress that i know and like doing this just to get along
4271681 to rapidly and responsibly meet the needs of the iraqi people
4271682 sustain to plan to budget execute and provide those services for the people
4271683 the challenge has been to come up with a distribution plan
4271684 there is an agreement to use five trucks that will work for eight hours to deliver water to the residents
4271685 we are suffering a lot due to this problem especially in summer water is very vital to us and we hope that further measures are taken to lessen our suffering
4271686 and dont appoint a gray bureaucrat to this job make it someone like arnold schwarzenegger or mike bloomberg who would capture the imagination of the public
4271687 set a goal for all american middle and high school students to perform 50 hours of service a year and for all college students to perform 100 hours of service a year
4271688 as the mind cannot conceive an army without the men to compose it
4271689 on the face of the constitution the objection that it does not give power to provide for such men would seem to be too frivolous for further notice
4271690 the battles of any war in which the folly or wickedness of government may engage
4271691 young people are not raw material to be employed by the political class on behalf of whatever fashionable political military or social cause catches its fancy in a free society their lives are not the playthings of government
4271692 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
4271693 the russians have lost more than 50 tanks and we have shot down 11 of their planes they have sustained enormous damage in terms of manpower
4271694 the georgian forces are not retreating we move our military according to security needs
4271695 there was no attack on the airport in tbilisi it was a factory that produces combat airplanes
4271696 the whole world is starting to understand that what is happening here will determine the future of this region the future price of crude oil the future of central asia and the future of nato
4271697 every bomb that falls over our heads is an attack on democracy on the european union and on america
4271698 the size and discount of that type of deal isnt the norm yet
4271699 the critical mass of bulk reo is in well capitalized institutions that dont need to sell yet in bulk at a deep discount because they are better off not taking substantial hits to the capital just to get the assets off their books
4271700 this type of bulk buy would make an impact on the market they are in a unique position because they have a long time horizon to invest and a cheap cost of capital its actually a perfect time for them to acquire these reo assets
4271701 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
4271702 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
4271703 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
4271704 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
4271705 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
4271706 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
4271707 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
4271708 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
4271709 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
4271710 my source also notes that dick cheney who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
4271711 instead he went to doug feiths office of special plans and asked them to do the job it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the central intelligence agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity
4271712 dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
4271713 i heard tonight that bin laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas
4271714 is not even in print at the time it is offered
4271715 the house is burning down and the president of the united states says this is the way to put out the fire applause and to me at this time there is only one answer to this question and that is to give the president what he demands and says is necessary to meet the situation
4271716 such action is necessary to protect the currency system of the united states
4271717 under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe any transactions in foreign exchange export or earmarkings of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency by any person within the united states
4271718 during any other period of national emergency declared by the president
4271719 require payment in gold or a particular kind of coin or currency or in an amount in money of the united states measured thereby
4271720 no man outside of a lunatic asylum will loan his money today on a farm mortgage
4271721 there is no limitation upon the power of congress it is not circumscribed in any respect whatever it is given full and plenary power to deal with that subject and therefore it is the same as if there were no constitution whatever
4271722 with the full understanding that the government may change its monetary policy at any time and that he must accept whatever the congress says at a particular time shall constitute money
4271723 coin money regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin and fix the standard of weights and measures
4271724 the constitutional power of the congress over the monetary system of the country t hese clauses interfere with the exertion of the power granted to the congress
4271725 obligations cannot be legally avoided by prohibiting the creditor from receiving the thing promised there would be no serious difficulty in estimating the value of 25 8 grains of gold in the currency now in circulation
4271726 for the government to say we have violated our contract but have escaped the consequences through our own statute would be monstrous in matters of contractual obligation the government cannot legislate so as to excuse itself
4271727 secreting or manipulating his assets with the intent to place them beyond the reach of creditors
4271728 will bring us unending humiliation the impending legal and moral chaos is appalling
4271729 that by false interpretations and naked usurpations the government has been made in practice a very widely and almost wholly different thing from what the constitution itself purports to authorize
4271730 has either authorized such a government as we have had or has been powerless to prevent it in either case it is unfit to exist
4271731 a broad multiclass multiracial movement is converging around obamas hope change and unity campaign because they see in it the thrilling opportunity to end 30 years of ultra right rule and move our nation forward with a broadly progressive agenda if obamas candidacy represented nothing more than the spark for this profound initiative to unite the working class and defeat the pernicious influence of racism it would be a transformative candidacy that would advance progressive politics for the long term the struggle to defeat the ultra right and turn our country on a positive path will not end with obamas election but that step will shift the ground for successful struggles going forward

4271737 the strength of the constitution lies entirely in the determination of each citizen to defend it only if every single citizen feels duty bound to do his share in this defense are the constitutional rights secure
4271738 todays supreme court decision is yet another stinging rebuke of the bush administrations extreme views on executive power time after time the supreme court has rebuffed the administrations attempts to undermine the constitution from its rasul and hamdi decisions in 2004 to its hamdan decision in 2006 it is a testament to our system of government that the court has rejected the habeas stripping provisions of the military commissions act and reaffirmed that the government does not have the power to detain people indefinitely and arbitrarily without judicial review the writ of habeas corpus provides one of the most significant protections of human freedom against arbitrary government action ever created we can and must fight terrorists without abandoning the principles on which our country was founded
4271739 the constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness you have to catch it yourself
4271740 the constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government lest it come to dominate our lives and interests
4271741 no provision in our constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority
4271742 we the people are the rightful masters of both congress and the courts not to overthrow the constitution but to overthrow the men who pervert the constitution

4271849 its as if with the eyes of faith when the church looks at the cross it sees not an electric chair but a vibrant tree

4271873 which suggests he was eating a lot of protein and had an active strenuous lifestyle the kiffian appear to have been fairly healthy it would be difficult to grow a body that tall and muscular without sufficient nutrition
4271874 this mans life was less rigorous perhaps taking smaller fish and game with more advanced hunting technologies
4271875 cida is not insisting that you do not receive support from cida for any projects unless you go into a certain part of the country or a certain part of the world or a certain part of afghanistan

4271878 we hire a lot of people on behalf of the canadian government
4271879 but we hire them as consultants so theyre actually freelancers not staff so they can actually initiate court cases against the canadian government we can say dont do that but we dont have any control over them
4271880 it seems that theres more protection given to security contractors than there are for development ngos
4271881 whats happened in afghanistan over the last few years is that the lines have been blurred and some people cannot easily make the distinction between those who are there to deliver humanitarian assistance and those who are there to bring security and who are involved militarily
4271882 we dont value their aid projects and we dont think they are working for the progress of our country
4271883 in kandahar city you have a hot war being fought while were also trying to deliver aid
4271884 were aware of that contact made and we have spoken to both david batten and jared golla in relation to recent communications they had received

4271890 obviously you need to be disciplined about recording it in your register but i find myself to be pretty disciplined on that
4271891 believe it or not ive seen a 20 cents transaction
4271892 thats not something that i would advocate but people are using them more as a cash and check replacement
4271893 the picture is completely absolutely 100 percent on schedule on time there were no delays
4271894 ive seen the movie it is fabulous we would have been perfectly able to have it out in november
4271895 it was a combination of a lot of sports it had something good from each one
4271896 those guys are amazing athletes i could have stayed here all night
4271897 it is irresponsible of the iemma government to push growth in aberglasslyn and rutherford without addressing the foul smell emanating from local industry which is having a real impact on the daily lives of residents
4271898 planning minister frank sartor and environment minister verity firth must work together to address the legitimate concerns of residents whose health is being affected by noxious odours
4271899 this state governments record on cracking down on polluters is extremely poor
4271900 the department of environment and climate change must closely monitor and enforce breaches of nsw pollution laws to protect residents not shield industry from proper regulation
4271901 were still gathering data on health complaints weve been told of two cancer clusters and high levels of asthma and respiratory disorders all related to people who are new to the area and who didnt have problems before
4271902 then weve had feedback from people who have left the area and their health has improved
4271903 we would like people to come down and check it out
4271904 the centre is doing excellently well were trading prolifically at the moment
4271905 the number of players is increasing there are about 70 kids enrolled in hook in2 hockey who are not from hockey families a number of schools are using the field that havent offered hockey before and theres no doubt the olympics coverage will rub off
4271906 its a wonderful facility and were very proud of it
4271907 were getting people coming from taree muswellbrook and cessnock even though they have their own centre there
4271908 this field is certified by the international hockey federation as suitable for international matches
4271909 i just love it i love the role ive been doing
4271910 im proud of the progress in the city and im proud to head up a team a team committed to working for maitland
4271911 our strategies keep maitland moving we have the plans in place to ensure maitland will continue to move forward
4271912 now there are more tough issues because of growing pains in terms of traffic and infrastructure
4271913 there are a lot of issues that need to be improved public transport and access to metford railway station from thornton north
4271914 unlike any other building in branxton in size or construction
4271915 in terms of context it would be the second highest building in branxton after the church spire
4271916 overriding all of that when you look down at the streetscape of branxton there are some wonderful old heritage buildings and this the shopping centre is going to be a concrete box
4271917 the f3 link is going to happen and when it does branxton will become a village if its allowed to be a village
4271918 branxtons traffic issues are very well publicised particularly the new england highway and clift street
4271919 this continues to worsen with residential development in branxton and further west and the continued prosperity of the mining industry
4271920 it will not improve until the f3 link is built and this proposed development will greatly magnify the issue
4271921 the area is also active with school busses and children with safety concerns in that regard already well documented this without a major development in the precinct which will involve regular movement of large delivery vehicles in a confined and busy precinct
4271922 the community is not against development per se it is inevitable however the safety heritage and traffic concerns dictate that this development and others like it should be proposed for areas outside the branxton village centre
4271923 there comes a time when a small community and locals in that community who call the village home need to stand up and voice opposition to inappropriate development
4271924 im sure that seven or eight people out of 10 dont use it
4271925 ive even seen people carrying babies or with young children crossing the road and its because of its location
4271926 its in an inconvenient place even people getting off at the bus stop have to walk 50m to the crossing and then walk back to the entrance to the hospital
4271927 the issue with this crossing is that there is a limited number of locations where it can be placed on that road
4271928 the site is located to provide the closest access point to the hospital entrance taking into consideration the emergency entrance and proximity to the merge lanes off the highway roundabout
4271929 i think the issue is really about managing pedestrian behaviour in that they are encouraged to cross at a certain point and that might include fencing
4271930 we have been in this house for four years and we would continue living here if we felt safe
4271931 we do have another house to go to somewhere else but it still needs a lot of repairs
4271932 my daughters are aged 13 11 and nine and my little boy is two years old
4271933 we are petrified about the juveniles who make our lives hell at night particularly over weekends
4271934 i have now been told we can leave our home at the end of september or sooner if a new tenant is found before that time
4271935 i very much appreciate the trouble our real estate agent has gone to together with the owner to say we can go before our lease expires
4271936 are there any real work at home jobs that are not scams
4271937 im completely astounded that weve got a concrete bridge thats not going to do the green and golden bell frog any good at all
4271938 these type of frogs do like disturbed areas but i dont think theyd like concrete
4271939 there is now little chance they will return at all
4271940 this seems to me like a drastic reaction to a complaint about a flooded pathway it would have been so easy to build a small wooden bridge over the area
4271941 its a puzzle and i would like to find out exactly why this was done
4271942 usually the greening plan committee is told of works that are going to happen with the environment but we werent told about any of the works here at the east maitland site so its pretty worrying
4271943 and as far as im concerned the days of concrete creeks are over its been proven they dont work they damage biodiversity and people now want a more natural way
4271944 there are now so many huge developments that i fear for the frogs survival here in maitland
4271945 i hope the community will come on board and help so we dont have to have bulldozers and we dont have to see bulldozers ever again
4271946 this issue is important in my mind because there is no question at all that the green and golden bell frog existed at gillieston heights
4271947 restore the quarry site so that it is suitable habitat for the bell frog
4271948 this animal was well known around maitland because maitland has quite a large number of wetlands and ponds
4271949 and it would have been flagged at the east maitland site because there is a historical record a museum record or a biological record that identifies this site as a habitat for the frog
4271950 from my knowledge there hasnt been a sighting of the bell frog in east maitland in the last 20 years
4271951 but thats not to say they are not still there
4271952 the difficulty for consent authorities like local government is the question of whether the animal still lives there and might it reappear because endangered species do that
4271953 but if youve wiped out their habitat you have no chance of them coming back
4271954 the brief filed today by the trial lawyers in the dupont case in response to my offices amicus brief filing is truly disappointing
4271955 our brief is solely based on the issue of due process and whether or not our supreme court follows the same standards as established by the u
4271956 what is amazing to me is that while our brief is based solely on the legal principles of due process and the right of appeal the trial lawyers brief led by several big out of state law firms does not address that legal issue in any way and instead spends their time attacking my secretary who has not been involved in one meeting on this issue and who does not deserve this kind of treatment
4271957 shame on these trial lawyers for attacking this hard working state employee and grandmother simply because i as governor dared to ask a legal question about due process thats just not right its these kinds of tactics that i believe have made people so discouraged about our legal system and after seeing up close and personal how they operate i am committed now more than ever to protecting the legal rights of all west virginians
4271958 we were sorely disappointed in the actions gov manchin took and his recent statement shows that he still doesnt get it
4271959 thousands of west virginians fought dupont because of what the company did to the town of spelter and surrounding communities
4271960 the governor has spent the day on the radio bolstering duponts claims and blasting trial lawyers we wish he would devote as much time and energy to addressing the needs of the thousands in spelter whose health and quality of life have been put at risk by the reckless conduct of dupont
4271961 most interesting here isnt who wrote the governors brief its the fact that a company that lost a big case in west virginia felt comfortable reaching out to governor manchin and giving him an entire brief to file on their behalf
4271962 how can air climb the columns of cans when theres no hole at the bottom of the can
4271963 duplicating yourself many times over and if you are one of those people who have always wanted to stay and be your own boss the home business network marketing is for you
4271964 are there any real work at home jobs that are not scams
4271965 who would have thunk that our people would perform so well in the pool
4271966 he is candid with me which i respect and even a bit humorous
4271967 i guess they won their super bowl rings in training camp because they didnt win it last year he said
4271968 i think people will like it because theres stuff in there they havent seen dundee said during a conference call promoting the show
4271969 the miami portion has always been glossed over but thats where it all started thats where heck this kid got to be a mature guy a man you know i got to thank you guys on the tube for helping him because he got glib and sharp on account of the newspaper guys radio guys and tv guys
4271970 i mean we knew we had armadillo problems but i didnt think you know a pack of wild dogs or something coming to do this
4271971 we are attacking warrants speeding issues drug complaints every complaint that comes across by desk we are going to be hammering these areas
4271972 with all the violence and stuff weve had here even around july the 4th
4271973 it makes you feel good to walk down the street knowing that theres cops walking and stuff but sending them somewhere else would you know not make us feel so safe
4271974 my questions were is it going to have an impact on crime fighting no
4271975 wisconsin milwaukee is going to be a battleground territory were going to be getting both presidential candidates as we get closer to the election here i think the experience they can gain even just the connections with the secret service
4271976 weve got to figure out what the problems are before we just start throwing millions of dollars around to repair small patches of road that eats away at our overall budget for greater infrastructure needs
4271977 this is a very long stretch and we want to look at all of it from a risk management basis to make sure what the extent of the problem is
4271978 i love it it gets good gas mileage and is easy get around town
4271979 i wish i could afford one i wish i could afford one
4271980 theyre small and hard for cars to see them and i dont think roads were really built for them
4271981 he only gave me a warning come on its a scooter
4271982 when we have a downpour where does the trash go it goes down the storm drains and into our creeks and out eventually into the river
4271983 fifteen percent of our water for our city is from the river
4271984 unfortunately a boater friend of mine mentioned he has seen some of the boaters littering
4271985 it upsets me when i see trash on the water
4271986 when you live in north carolina you ought to keep north carolina clean
4271987 you have a system thats supposed to strengthen airport security but you dont use the results of the tests to do exactly what youre doing the tests for
4271988 the agency is not fully using the results of these tests
4271989 pure and undefiled religion in the sight of our god and father is this to visit orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself unstained by the world

4272011 my feet are not in the same position they have been in for the first 30 years of my life so it is kind of putting them in a new position and they are not comfortable with it
4272012 they are sore i think i will be all right
4272013 thats one of the main reasons i am doing it
4272014 i am getting there slowly but surely but the season is coming around pretty quick and i am trying to get a sense of how i feel

4272023 he has this quiet demeanor easy going person like somebody that you could get along with
4272024 i remember his sincerity and compassion and his real interest
4272025 i would just tell him i will keep him in my prayers
4272026 it happened to me three times in the last month
4272027 the window was smashed and two dollars in coins was taken out of the car
4272028 theres been over 20 incidents in our building alone im telling you its like every night you come out here you know a car got hit
4272029 its just a matter of whose car is it gonna be its gotten a little ridiculous
4272030 some people havent been reporting the crime so nypd doesnt know the scope of the problem

4272033 mckinnie is in hot water with the league due to a february 2008 incident during which he allegedly whacked a bouncer in the head with a pole
4272034 this is a first step in a correct direction but that cant erase what has happened in the past few years

4272036 there is a witch hunt there are that many rules people cant keep up you need a philadelphia lawyer to sort it out why did they the fa let it go through why all of a sudden does it come out two weeks before the end of the transfer window
4272037 im not saying i never did it i did do it but what i am saying is i did it two years ago
4272038 this is nothing more than a technicality which we will strongly contest his benjanis transfer to manchester city in january 2008 was approved at the time by the premier league and the fas compliance unit
4272039 what we need to do is inquire of the army or all of the military if they know of any more situations like this that need fixing
4272040 my intent was to rescind the militarys orders sending them there to texas and go get them and i had the support of gov charlie crist to do it
4272041 were keeping them at the holiday inn holiday crown plaza and vans are coming to pick them up for training every day
4272042 the moms and dads of florida who trust us with their kids
4272043 were taking care of them and they are still getting training
4272044 theres been some drama down here as a result of a formal complaint another unit lodged alleging horrible living conditions that subjected them to grotesque heat it is hot but its not grotesque
4272045 the unit in question however was moved from our current location to a hotel so that they may sleep in comfort i wont name them but i will say that i hope theyre not around if im ever bleeding in the desert since they probably wouldnt bring me a pressure dressing if its above 85 degrees
4272046 we need to get them ready for iraq they are ready
4272047 this was a situation that got a bit out of control but its fixed now
4272048 i think it was just something that the chain of command didnt pay attention to lets face it they are busy
4272049 congress can do a lot to fix these things if theres a problem that requires money we can provide the money
4272050 in the public mind to make it a major sport

4272059 clearly the humans know they could not possibly stand against us in the information intelligence round and so we are not even on the stage such cowardice is to be expected but to set up the agility and physical challenge sections so that we are forced to help you it is a farce

4272070 profound implications for our security relationship going forward not only bilaterally but with nato
4272071 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4272072 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4272073 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4272074 the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations
4272075 but by the same token my personal view is that there needs to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4272076 we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
4272077 and so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion
4272078 make sure that the airports are available to us the roads are available to us and the seaports available to us
4272079 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the longtime russian sphere of influence
4272080 i have never believed that one should make national security policy on the basis of trust i think you make national security policy based on interests and on realities
4272081 we are playing with peoples livelihoods here the competition between retailers is intense if they are going to pay for these promotions out of their own money then all well and good but we know both historically and from bitter experience they will come looking for farmers to help redress the balance they dont often give up any of their margin for long
4272082 we recognise that customers are struggling we have had a good six to eight months but our costs are going up and confidence is fragile this price cutting could force more farmers to go under
4272083 we had made these arrangements for this round of negotiations before the conflict in georgia and so we just merely continued with the schedule we had
4272084 we believe that missile defence is a substantial contribution to natos collective security

4272099 barack obama has voted in support of higher taxes 94 times in just 3 years including higher taxes for americans making just 42 000 a year if voters consider barack obamas record of opposing tax cuts and his outspoken proposals to raise taxes on family savings social security and small businesses this latest campaign promise lacks a single shred of credibility
4272100 the resolution obama voted for would not have increased taxes on any single taxpayer making less than 41 500 per year in total income or any couple making less than 83 000 the 32 000 figure is approximately the taxable income of a single person making 41 500 per year after all deductions and exclusions

4272125 said to be in good health today after undergoing heart surgery in the united states an operation that left some iraqis wondering whether he is still fit for the job
4272126 a statement by the presidential press office said talabani entered the mayo clinic in rochester minnesota on aug 2 for knee surgery but the medical team found out that he suffers from a problem in one of the heart valves
4272127 we thought we could lie but reuters found out the truth broke the story and now we have to admit to the heart surgery
4272128 nassar al rubaie a senior shia politician said the medical reports from the hospital would determine whether the heart operation would affect mr talabanis ability to work

4272133 whats left for us to decide as the people is there anything left for us to decide as these corporations have hijacked our government and control about every department and agency
4272134 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country the tax system that allows this whole sale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hard working americans who pay their fair share of taxes we need to plug these tax loopholes and put these corporations back on the tax rolls
4272135 this report makes clear that too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and to avoid paying their fare share in the united states
4272136 these global companies have now reached a point of power and manipulation where they can decide how much taxes theyre going to pay where theyre going to pay these taxes and when theyre going to pay these taxes
4272137 well we have to do this to keep up with the global competition
4272138 it is extremely important to maintain our existing store base in a tough environment with significant competition for customers whose disposable income is shrinking
4272139 we believe that ksss inventory management initiatives and increased private and exclusive brand penetration helped to mitigate the margin pressures exerted by the companys lackluster sales
4272140 theyre going to be able to show real newness and freshness and thats whats selling

4272145 dad i have a better idea lets surprise her with a game of wii when she gets home
4272146 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4272147 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4272148 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4272149 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the will not be affected by this change
4272150 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
4272151 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4272152 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
4272153 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve

4272161 there has been a lot of misinformation circulating about plasma hdtvs and longevity and were happy to once again set the record straight on the durability of panasonic plasma
4272162 quite simply our plasma tvs are built to last a very long time as much as 100 000 hours to half their brightness
4272163 high proportion of recommendations of lcd sets is primarily due to retail salespersons lack of knowledge regarding recent improvements in plasma technology
4272164 plasma hdtvs have a very strong track record of exceptional durability and lifespan
4272165 panasonic plasmas have consistently been rated among the best hdtvs available by many of the most respected publications in our industry despite what consumers may hear from misinformed sources plasma is the right choice for educated consumers looking for stunning picture quality and the ultimate big screen viewing experience
4272166 with the digital transition on the horizon and an increased awareness among consumers about high definition consumers now demand blacker blacks faster response times and the billions of colors that panasonic plasma is known for worldwide
4272167 when you also consider the tremendous customer support system behind all of our hdtvs through our exclusive viera concierge program and added features like a tuf display glass panel that can withstand strong impacts a viera plasma hdtv is a partner youll be able to count on for the long haul

4272173 the intellectual elite causing an impression of loss of courage by the entire society should one point out that from ancient times decline in courage has been considered the beginning of the end
4272174 the constant desire to have still more things and a still better life and the struggle to obtain them imprints many western faces with worry and even depression the majority of people have been granted well being to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream about
4272175 today well being in the life of western society has begun to reveal its pernicious mask
4272176 the defense of individual rights has reached such extremes as to make society as a whole defenseless against certain individuals it is time in the west to defend not so much human rights as human obligations
4272177 destructive and irresponsible freedom has been granted boundless space society appears to have little defense against the abyss of human decadence such as for example misuse of liberty for moral violence against young people motion pictures full of pornography crime and horror
4272178 a false slogan characteristic of a false era people also have the right not to know and it is a much more valuable one
4272179 the right not to have their divine souls stuffed with gossip nonsense vain talk a person who works and leads a meaningful life does not need this excessive burdening flow of information
4272180 through intense suffering our country has now achieved a spiritual development of such intensity that the western system in its present state of spiritual exhaustion does not look attractive
4272181 at the core of liberalism is the spoiled child miserable as all spoiled children are unsatisfied demanding ill disciplined despotic and useless liberalism is a philosophy of sniveling brats

4272203 restore democracy to the licensing process and send out a powerful message that buying a lap dance is not the same as buying a cappuccino
4272204 many local authorities have added their voice to growing calls for an end to licensing of lap dancing clubs as cafes
4272205 current licensing has acted as a floodgate to the industry whilst making it difficult for local authorities and local people to have a say in this process
4272206 it has helped normalise lap dancing clubs and attitudes that encourage seeing women as sex objects not people
4272207 the solution to this problem does not lie in tinkering with the licensing act 2003 or in planning controls

4272219 having a web site like this out there puts a lot of law enforcement in danger it exposes us out there

4272221 if theyre doing a good job they have nothing to fear and thats our hope that we would kind of sift out the bad cops
4272222 our web sites purpose is to break the stereotype that people have that cops are all bad by having officers become responsible for their actions
4272223 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4272224 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that senator mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson

4272261 her mother was also a great cook thats where she got it from
4272262 the notes started on june 2nd he couldnt take it anymore the arguing
4272263 he left a pre will when in reality it was a suicide note
4272264 she startled him but there was no reason to take her life
4272265 we welcome a diversity of opinion but are advancing the opinions of those who are most affected by these stereotypes and taunts for us it is their opinions not the critics that matter
4272266 a coalition of disability advocate groups is organizing a boycott of tropic thunder based on what they see as the offensiveness of the simple jack gags but comedy needs the right to be offensive and stiller at least has the courage of his convictions when he uses the word retard its deliberate not casual
4272267 if youre part of the group thats protesting tropic thunder claiming that the movies humor comes at the expense of the mentally disabled then you may have lots of company in your picket line
4272268 a scene in which lazarus criticizes speedman for going full retard in simple jack is a put down only of overweening ambitious actors who take roles as physically and mentally challenged characters because theyre proven oscar bait
4272269 tropic thunder is drawing fire from special interest groups for its frequent use of the word retard but discerning audiences will know where the humor is targeted and theyll be laughing too hard to take offense
4272270 the scripts references to retards have generated some pre release controversy but advocates for people with learning disabilities should find something worthier to protest the target here is the pretensions of movie stars who think that by adopting a stammer they can understand the problems of the people they portray
4272271 stiller isnt making fun of those with mental retardation hes skewering an industry that honors actors who prove their seriousness by taking such roles
4272272 despite what you may have read lately the biggest target of ridicule in tropic thunder a flashy nasty on and off funny and assaultive sendup of the film industry is not the mentally retarded rather the true targets of this extreme comedys free flowing contempt are the stars makers brokers miscellaneous supplicants and even die hard fans of the movies who are all portrayed as challenged in some fashion intellectually ethically aesthetically sartorially chemically longitudinally you name it
4272273 if actors like kirk lazarus or tugg speedman ever had to confront a mentally challenged person or a true wartime enemy tropic thunder would be a riskier and more resonant comedy within his showbiz humor limits though stiller proves to be a gutsy writer director and performer
4272274 not only is tropic thunder guaranteed to offend it already has one of the mock films it references simple jack and its story of a developmentally challenged young person who talks to animals uses the tag line once upon a time there was a retard this has so upset advocacy groups that news reports say a coalition of them is intending to call for a nationwide boycott to protest the movies open ridicule of the intellectually disabled but it would be regrettable if tropic thunders undeniable excesses including having an actor indulge in the 21st century version of blackface blinded viewers to the reality that like it or not there is genuine humor and palpable satiric intent underneath the waves of unnerving bad taste and political incorrectness
4272275 the scene in which the derisive alpa chino brandon t jackson nails lazarus recitation of black uplift homilies as nothing more than the lyrics to the jeffersons theme is funny but the one in which lazarus quietly explains to speedman that his simple jack character failed because he made the mistake of going full retard rather than softening his character with cuteness in the manner of forrest gump is so on the nose accurate it takes your breath away
4272276 not only have senator mccain and his agents plainly infringed mr brownes copyright in running on empty but the federal courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singers voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singers right of publicity

4272279 youve got to be careful off the tee to hit the fairways thats going to be the key all week
4272280 i got off to a great start and made tons of putts
4272281 i missed a few opportunities on the second nine but i made a birdie to finish on a high note so im very pleased this course is tough and 5 under id take that any day here
4272282 id say the difference between the back nine and the front is the greens theyre not as undulating
4272283 but i want to say i had a career putting round
4272284 i cant remember the last time i had 10 putts on nine holes thats what you need to score here
4272285 i dont think the trend of today rounds of 5 under or 4 under are going to continue the rest of the week
4272286 i dont think well see 11 under or 10 under on the very last day maybe 8 under or 7 under will win it
4272287 a lo mejor esta muralla me ha dado el poder y la fuerza para lograrlo uno piensa en el enorme trabajo que tuvieron que hacer para construir esto puede que fuera una se al de que yo ten a que hacer lo mismo y lo hice

4272294 know my son with how little wisdom the world is governed
4272295 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
4272296 government is at a stand little better practiced now than three or four thousand years ago
4272297 our foreign policy is something that is concocted in washington d c but it reflects the perceptions of our political elite about what we the people want
4272298 and what we want by and large is this continuing flow of very cheap consumer goods we want to be able to pump gas into our cars regardless of how big they may happen to be and we want to be able to do these things without having to think about whether or not the books are balanced at the end of the month or the end of the fiscal year
4272299 one of the ways we avoid confronting our refusal to balance the books is to rely increasingly on the projection of american military power around the world to try to maintain this dysfunctional system or set of arrangements that have evolved over the last 30 or 40 years
4272300 the clearest statement of what i value is found in the preamble to the constitution
4272301 the congress especially with regard to matters related to national security policy has thrust power and authority to the executive branch we have created an imperial presidency the congress no longer is able to articulate a vision of what is the common good the congress exists primarily to ensure the reelection of members of congress
4272302 was a fundamental mistake it never should have been undertaken and were never going to do this kind of thing again
4272303 be the moment when we look ourselves in the mirror and see what we have become and perhaps undertake an effort to make those changes in the american way of life that will enable us to preserve for future generations that which we value most about the american way of life

4272313 the government is having to grapple with issues like the cash for vote scam fake cds and now the land scam of an important ally like lalu
4272314 this is highly disappointing because pbor constitute the real backbone of the forces they have been left high and dry especially since officers will get rs 6 000 as msp it should have been a graded msp
4272315 jawans feel their officers especially the service chiefs have not taken their case of low msp coupled with the paltry increase in their gross salaries forcefully enough with the government
4272316 the fifth pay commission gave rise to as many as 36 anomalies which took a decade to resolve
4272317 even as more details are awaited prima facie all the concerns of the defence forces appear to have been suitably addressed
4272318 a part of this benefit however has been taken away by modifying pb 4 from rs 39 200 67 000 to rs 37 400 67 000
4272319 the film with srk is two years old we will be creating two new films directed by rakeysh mehra that will have aamir khan promoting our logo of atithi devo bhava
4272320 the government has not considered performance as the benchmark for deciding any such criteria
4272321 the government has not addressed the issue of discrimination in promotional avenues and higher grade pay in comparison to ias

4272359 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4272360 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4272390 it is no secret that dcra is a mess this is endemic to what weve seen in other dc agencies and frankly we are concerned as there is no legal reason why these inspectors should be fired we are asking the dc city council to look into this
4272391 the commercial inspectors being placed on administrative leave all carry the proper trade specific certifications and licenses as needed by their disciplines and as required by dc law
4272392 once again we are facing a situation where skilled knowledgeable experienced inspectors are being let go for not obtaining an unnecessary and meaningless certification to do their jobs
4272393 to date dc has not adopted any of these icc regulations for commercial inspectors there is simply no basis for requiring inspectors to learn and be tested on codes that are not in effect in dc
4272394 this is hurting not helping the district of columbia to provide better services to residents when these experienced inspectors are put on administrative leave the dcra hires contractors to conduct the inspections the great irony is that these contractors dont have the certifications that our inspectors do nor do they carry the icc certification for which our inspectors have been fired this is a health and safety issue for the entire city
4272395 by imposing certification standards that are not in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations dcra clearly does not seek to have the inspectors perform effectively instead dcra is looking for scapegoats among inspectors for agency managements failure to create and properly manage the inspection program for the district we are looking at every remedial action available including filing grievances filing an unfair labor practices complaint and taking appropriate action in dc courts in an attempt to halt the wrongful acts of the dcra
4272396 we are excited by the growth trajectory at meta payment systems and the stability of the metabank loan portfolio mps third quarter fee revenue more than doubled year over year and our continuing investment in mps provides a platform for sustaining the high rate of growth in the division as well as product innovation as underscored by the five additional patents filed during the quarter meanwhile despite difficult industry conditions we are pleased with the overall credit quality and stability of our loan portfolio
4272397 im stuck with everyone else on this list wondering am i someones political enemy or do i live in a country where the government is just utterly and completely incompetent
4272398 we are pleased to report solid revenue and profitability in the second quarter primarily due to strong demand and price increases for our plasma based products
4272399 during the quarter we received approvals from the sfda to produce cryoprecipitate and to conduct clinical trials of human prothrombin complex we are now one of the few producers offering the widest range of human albumin products available in china we also received approval during the period to set up a new plasma collection station in guangxi province due to the relocation of our fang cheng plasma collection station which represents a significant milestone for our company and further secures our plasma supply
4272400 we are pleased with our operational results given the governments restriction on both the supply of human plasma and the slow approval process of the plasma based products for sale earlier in the year
4272401 now that the government approval process for plasma based finished goods has returned to more normal levels we are optimistic about our outlook for the remainder of the year we have made great efforts to secure raw material inventories and finished products in order to better serve our customers

4272463 i said it when i came into the league seven years ago and i say it now theres no doubt in my mind that i can play in this league and theres no doubt i can be a starting quarterback in this league
4272464 i thought he made a number of throws last week in the game he moved the offense and we were able to score 10 points with him as the quarterback
4272465 you know there have been a few bumps along the way and sometimes theres situations you cant control
4272466 but i think the true measure of a man isnt when things are going well when things are going well its easy no the true measure of a man is when things arent going well how does he carry himself

4272469 we as a team definitely learned some lessons about disclosure and how we can all too easily get ahead of ourselves in talking about features before our understanding of them is solid our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk
4272470 related to disclosure is the idea of how we make sure not to set expectations around the release that end up disappointing you features that dont make it claims that dont stick or support we dont provide
4272471 with windows 7 were trying to more carefully plan how we share information with our customers and partners this means sharing the right level of information at the right time depending on the needs of the audience

4272502 nfs is getting pressure from clustered file systems like lustre and gpfs as well as custom file systems produced by web 2 0 service providers such as google gfs
4272503 even for files too small to stripe those files can be distributed across multiple nfs servers which provides statistical load balancing
4272504 with a capable cluster of nfs servers and a back end file system files or ranges within files can be relocated transparent to the applications accessing data over pnfs
4272505 pnfs moves the metadata server out of the data transfer path
4272506 instead of having to deal with a number of competing proprietary and open source parallel file systems pnfs will allow users to reap the benefits of parallel storage systems by choosing best of breed solutions without having concerns over vendor lock in
4272507 for environments that need improved performance for large sequential files where parallel access is needed pnfs has some legs moving forward
4272508 however not every environment or application needs parallel access to data
4272509 for mainstream markets pnfs will most likely remain a niche at least near term being used for specialized applications and environments
4272510 the big benefactors of pnfs will be the parallel file systems like those from ibm sun ibrix and others as well as proprietary storage systems like those from panasas
4272511 the architecture for the pnfs proposal was derived from the panasas directflow parallel protocol which is a core component utilized by the panasas panfs parallel file system
4272512 the directflow protocol used in our activestor parallel storage clusters currently provides essentially all of the functionality expected to be available in the nfs 4 1 later this year

4272523 we can conceive of no way to draw a principled line permitting drug testing only student athletes
4272524 if we were to allow random drug testing here what prevents school districts from either later drug testing students participating in any extracurricular activities as federal courts now allow or testing the entire student population
4272525 as a result of this ruling we dont expect to see other districts pursuing suspicionless testing programs
4272526 the schools interest in detecting drug use does not justify nonconsensual drug testing
4272527 under carefully defined circumstances a random suspicionless drug testing program for high school student athletes in my opinion might also be implemented that will meet applicable constitutional requirements

4272541 that kind of money is not going to change anything however i see these initial funds as important elements to create a new economic paradigm for the amazon
4272542 it is much more important they the funds are used to develop alternatives not only for law enforcement
4272543 otherwise it will be very difficult even with large inflows of money to protect the forest because you almost need a police state you almost need the army deployed all over the amazon
4272544 it just postpones deforestation but its not a final solution the final fix is to create a new economy that can give jobs to several million people
4272545 there is absolutely no denying the fact that the speech marks a milestone in
4272546 time has arrived for the silent majority to make visible and significant effort to seal off the debate and move towards the desired destiny
4272547 youve got to be careful off the tee to hit the fairways thats going to be the key all week

4272549 i missed a few opportunities on the second nine but i made a birdie to finish on a high note so im very pleased

4272556 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4272557 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4272558 like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of

4272572 such a small library i just thought wow the people at the desk cant even notice that a pervert is loitering when everything is right in front of you
4272573 we think this is just an unfortunate and isolated incident we feel like libraries are safe places for families
4272574 weve given it a lot of thought we think our internet use guideline is a nice balance between protecting peoples right to information and protecting general users at the library
4272575 such a database helps the tsa spot patterns of activity that may indicate terrorist planning and refer people to the fbi for possible questioning

4272577 this is one of the worlds deadliest viruses we know the percentage of recovered animals continue to carry the virus but we dont know what proportion that is
4272578 but we certainly know that it happens and there has been reappearances of the virus in that animal and that is a real risk
4272579 it was a tough decision but largely based on the opinion from the medical profession the risk to humans outweigh keeping the animal alive in the long term
4272580 the last two generations of his family were 100 per cent runners to winners
4272581 the government committed to a more disciplined approach to managing its spending and focusing on programs that are our priorities so more than anything its a budgeting expenditure decision and we feel canadians want accountability for their tax dollars and were following through on that commitment
4272582 that decision in and of itself should cause a shockwave for christian education across the country because the idea that a public university paid for by the taxpayers whose kids are at that christian school and now its off limits its a very dangerous precedent
4272583 it makes sense why they would want to be called it it makes no sense why we would want to call them that
4272584 this feeds into their idea that this is a religious war and its not they want it to be a war of religions but we have said very clearly that this is not a war on islam its not christianity vs islam in some way its about radicals its about extremists who are using violence
4272585 the fact is the muslim world isnt waiting around holding its breath to hear the u s government an infidel entity define islamic terms for them
4272586 this seems to me unprecedented when we fought the japanese and we fought the nazis we called them what they called themselves
4272587 if osama bin laden calls himself a mujahid we should understand what a mujahid is and we should understand that that is in english a holy warrior whos fighting on behalf of islam
4272588 you want to know your enemy how they think what they call themselves what those terms mean
4272589 you trace it to islamic doctrine and law jihad is simply warfare to subjugate the infidel world to islamic rule

4272594 perhaps our only fault or achilles heel has been frankly our number of conflicts as a result of the amount of programming we own and control
4272595 its unavoidable and we hate it more than the public does so this is a solution
4272596 highlighting canadian culture on the world stage not only benefits artists it also helps generate tourism immigration business and investment back in canada limiting international exposure of canadian excellence is a short sighted move by the government
4272597 while the government maintains that it wants to encourage trade and co production to attract foreign investment we find it paradoxical that it has chosen to eliminate the trade routes program which has a specific mandate to help companies in our sector export
4272598 and these cuts are in addition to the governments refusal to respond to the needs of our community for increased support to feature films theatrical documentaries and co production
4272599 to date there has been no indication on what the government plans to do with these programs which are integral to the viability of the independent television and interactive media production sectors
4272600 we are concerned that cuts to canadian cultural funds will harm the film and television industry at a time when many producers are looking at what impact the internet and other federal funding policies will have on them in years to come
4272601 we need to remind the government of this to make certain our industry isnt slowly chipped away by successive cuts to the support programs that ensure its viability and success
4272602 one focussed on lifelong learning in the non theatrical sector and most often supporting the early works of young upcoming producers
4272603 russia has been and still is the primary guarantor of peace in the caucasus
4272604 surely we cannot simply stand by as an autocratic aggressor gobbles up part of and perhaps destabilizes all of a friendly democratic nation that we were sponsoring for nato membership a few months ago
4272605 for that matter consider the implications of our turning away from georgia for other aspiring pro western governments in the neighborhood like ukraines
4272606 europe and the united states must make clear to mr medvedev and the real power player prime minister vladimir putin that more aggression and lies will not be tolerated they must make clear that russia will pay a price in diplomatic standing and economic relations if it does not immediately withdraw its troops agree to international mediation and permit the deployment of truly neutral international peacekeepers to georgias breakaway regions south ossetia and abkhazia
4272607 the u s will pay a price in diplomatic standing and economic relations if it does not immediately withdraw its troops
4272608 he was cremated and i couldnt resist grinding him up with a little bit of blow my dad wouldnt have cared
4272609 we left 12 men on base we had all kinds of chances to win the game and we couldnt get it done i dont have to say nothing to them on a night like this i dont have to say a word
4272610 the business of theology is to make sure that our questions to the scriptures of any religious tradition will be directed in such a way as to allow ourselves to be challenged and even shaken at the deepest levels of our existence by what the text says
4272611 for even the man of my peace in whom i trusted who ate my bread hath lifted up his heel against me
4272612 the wounds of a friend are more to be trusted that the spontaneous kisses of an enemy
4272613 then judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned repented himself and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders saying i have sinned in that i have betrayed the innocent blood and they said what is that to us see thou to that and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went and hanged himself and the chief priests took the silver pieces and said it is not lawful for to put them into the treasury because it is the price of blood and they took counsel and bought with them the potters field to bury strangers in wherefore that field was called the field of blood unto this day then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet saying and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was valued whom they of the children of israel did value and gave them for the potters field as the lord appointed me
4272614 ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover and the son of man is betrayed to be crucified
4272615 dantas fez acusa es grav ssimas ao prot genes e s tem um jeito de descobrirmos quem est falando a verdade temos que colocar um frente a frente do outro
4272616 ontarget doesnt help us at all and if the message that comes out from this is dont use this combination for this particular group of people that would be dangerous
4272617 with an adverse effect of combination therapy on typical renal outcomes and on decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr but beneficial effects on proteinuria
4272618 this finding is important because the theory has been that the benefit of combined arb ace inhibitor therapy is strongest in protecting the kidney but this paper shows that that is not true and that if anything its harmful a lot of nephrologists use this combination therapy so this paper has a lot of implications
4272619 do show in favor of combination therapy for the primary outcome in this group with a relative risk reduction of 8 but this was not significant
4272620 therefore there is no evidence to support the use of combination therapy in any subgroup of patients included in ontarget beyond lowering of urinary albumin excretion
4272621 our results are applicable to those with protein excretion lt 1 g day but not to those with excretion gt 1 g day ie the very sickest patients of whom there were only a couple of hundred in ontarget
4272622 a third of the patients were normotensive and when you give a combination of these blockers to these patients it could be potentially harmful and as we saw it was associated with more hypotension which was the main side effect and more syncope
4272623 you get many more acute renal failure episodes with the combination but the difference is in acute renal failure not in chronic renal failure chronic dialysis and doubling of creatinine among these end points we saw very minor differences in this analysis
4272624 because of the diverse population you have a few people who might benefit from the combination but many more people in danger because they were not hypertensive and many of them had atherosclerotic vascular disease in the renal arteries they were the people who would have developed acute renal failure being on the combination
4272625 a properly done prospective trial of patients with advanced proteinuric chronic kidney disease is still needed to answer definitively the question about the efficacy of combination therapy to block the renin angiotensin system ras on progression of chronic kidney disease
4272626 although there is also evidence from meta analyses of smaller studies on this kind of population to support the conclusion
4272627 this is the end of the natural history of this disease and in these people we do want to block the ras to make their engine work at a smaller rate to preserve the low function
4272628 dance shows always do well but it has to be adapted for trends working on tv
4272629 its quite a positive show theres not a lot meanness that may exist in other reality programming
4272630 for a lot of people it reminds them of the time when tv wasnt so hostile
4272631 our show was really more about watching the creativity happen and contestants learning the choreography in a different sub genre each week
4272632 dancers are dramatic and emotional and i think its really compelling to watch
4272633 what these shows have replaced is what we no longer have a large support for the arts
4272634 the government no longer supports the arts theyre not fed like they were
4272635 weve seen a big increase in interest since the shows went on air
4272636 weve done a lot of ballroom classes and choreographed dances for weddings dance is on the brain
4272637 of course some of these shows are not for the dance purist
4272638 but it has such a domino effect on dance and getting people to think about dance its really just fantastic
4272639 people know the difference they see how hard these dancers work and realize that its a skill
4272640 at the same time it may inspire them to learn something new
4272641 how could we possibly be old enough to have a kid in college
4272642 i think this is going to be a good fight for me
4272643 it the fight was totally unexpected but the more i train for it the more i like it i havent been able to show much of my ability on the ground in the ufc yet and i plan on taking this fight there
4272644 i know lambert is a ground and pound guy and so am i so it has the potential to be an all out war on the ground i have been working hard on my ground for this fight and i want to show off my submission skills he is not scared to stand with guys and if he tries to avoid my takedowns and keep it standing then i have no problem ending it on the feet
4272645 day is a tough guy with good kickboxing and jiu jitsu
4272646 when youre by yourself and your mind can wander a bit ive had some pretty amazing characters walk into my brain or i get a big what if idea or a scene
4272647 its about two people trying to figure out what it means to be in love with each other and thats what happened to me and i chose to write about it
4272648 maybe people want to hear what you think rather than what you think happens in the world
4272649 people are just drawn to each other even if its unhealthy its not something they want in their brain its something they want in their heart
4272650 its something they cant live without and a lot of the time its something they cant live with either
4272651 i love plays that have some kind of big tense focus to them the stakes are so high that something explosive has to happen
4272652 often in scripts from young people there are so many locations that its difficult to deal with on the stage
4272653 but the last thing im interested in is trying to shoo any of that energy away before its down on paper im far more interested in figuring out how to get that car on stage than telling them its not a good idea
4272654 were just trying to figure out how a mother and daughter would relate to each other if the mother was diagnosed with breast cancer
4272655 since she has had so much life experience she had a well of emotions to draw from
4272656 she kicked my butt its radical how much life experience trumps training
4272657 theres a reason it didnt mention the carbon tax policy
4272658 thats because its a bad policy for atlantic canada it would hurt families here it would hurt industries here and thats why theyre not talking about it
4272659 we are going to make sure that atlantic canadians are not tricked into voting for a carbon tax that would damage the region
4272660 it will drive up the price of everything transportation groceries electricity heating even propane for our bbqs
4272661 this carbon tax has been the hidden agenda of the liberal party for years
4272662 hmm they look like furry peas do furry peas grow on trees
4272663 i looked out and i was like oh my god it was so freaky because i was thinking man if i was out there just taking my dog outside it could eat my dog or attack me
4272664 i was like shocked that they actually live back here

4272698 we loved the near native performance of windows guests in hyper v
4272699 the most notable and the most significant change between the initial release candidate version rc0 of hyper v and the rtm edition is better performance most of the performance work was done between rc0 and rc1 but not many people knew about it due to a not so wide a release and b a ban on performance testing by ms
4272700 virtual machine overhead has been part of the folklore for quite some time
4272701 in my view successfully put it performance overhead to bed
4272702 the core name is and will be our flagship pc processor brand going forward
4272703 expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now
4272704 it also undermines a great deal of confidence in microsoft that will take some time to recover
4272705 by doing this time warner forces the class to pay a much larger amount of money than would be the case if they were allowed to purchase a cable box of their choice from the manufacturer of their choosing
4272706 i think its very similar to the cases brought back in those days where slowly but surely the courts whittled away at that kind of protectionist activity by at amp t
4272707 i think the same thing is present here you have a lot of companies out there manufacturing these boxes and theres nothing necessarily proprietary about them

4272716 the 3g coverage of t mobile is as good as the competition there can therefore not lie we suspect that it is a hardware software specific issue of the iphone itself
4272717 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
4272718 within two hours 100 000 people downloaded the new cover
4272719 thats not a lot of people for the internet but about 75 000 people more than went to the last jets game

4272744 think of a ship leaving a harbour and think of it with the complete voyage mapped out and planned
4272745 the captain and crew no exactly where it is going and how long it will take
4272746 it has a definite goal now 9 999 times out of 10 000 it will get to where it started out to get
4272747 now lets take another ship just like the first only lets not put a captain on it or a crew at the helm lets give it no aiming point no goal no destination well just start the engines and let it go
4272748 i think youll agree with me that if it gets out of the harbour at all itll either sink or end up on some deserted beach a derelict it cant go any place because it has no destination and no guidance

4272784 i conclude therefore the law to be that the public highway is a public place which the public may enjoy for any reasonable purpose provided the activity in question does not amount to a public or private nuisance and does not obstruct the highway by unreasonably impeding the primary right of the public to pass and repass within these qualifications there is a public right of peaceful assembly on the highway since the law confers this public right i deprecate any attempt artificially to restrict its scope it must be for the magistrates in every case to decide whether the user of the highway under consideration is both reasonable in the sense defined and not inconsistent with the primary right of the public to pass and repass in particular there can be no principled basis for limiting the scope of the right by reference to the subjective intentions of the persons assembling once the right to assemble within the limitations i have defined is accepted it is self evident that it cannot be excluded by an intention to exercise it provided an assembly is reasonable and non obstructive taking into account its size duration and the nature of the highway on which it takes place it is irrelevant whether it is premeditated or spontaneous what matters is its objective nature to draw a distinction on the basis of anterior intention is in substance to reintroduce an incidentality requirement for the reasons i have given that requirement properly applied would make unlawful commonplace activities which are well accepted equally to stipulate in the abstract any maximum size or duration for a lawful assembly would be an unwarranted restriction on the right defined these judgments are ever ones of fact and degree for the court of trial
4272785 i am not bound by the decision of the house of lords but i choose to follow the decision one of the reasons i have adopted the majority decision in jones is it seems to be reinforced by ss 14 16 and 18 new zealand bill of rights act 1990 i might note that the dissents in jones are subtle as i read the dissenting speeches they were not saying that there was no right of assembly on roads but rather they were not prepared to lift it to the level of the same importance as the ancient right of passage in that respect i agree that the ancient right of passing and repassing on the highway is the most critical right and always has been it is the right which is central to our constitutional history it is no exaggeration to say that the british are freedom loving people and the love of that freedom was brought to new zealand when it was settled as a british colony the right of the meanest citizen to travel on the highway has always been regarded by the law as a key protection for every individual to live the life he or she wants to move to whichever property he or she wants to go and meet with whomever he or she wants to meet with it also follows however widely one defines the right that a common law court will always look for very clear language indeed from parliament before finding that right is qualified in any way
4272786 60 as discussed above the fact that s 4 1 a is concerned with behaviour in or within view of a public place necessarily influences the meaning of
4272787 certainly of the highest order in a free and civilized society
4272788 from time to time lawyers and judges have tried to define what constitutes fairness like defining an elephant it is not easy to do although fairness in practice has the elephantine quality of being easy to recognise as a result of these efforts a word in common usage has acquired the trappings of legalism acting fairly has become acting in accordance with the rules of natural justice and on occasion has been dressed up with latin tags this phrase in my opinion serves no useful purpose and in recent years it has encouraged lawyers to try to put those who hold inquiries into legal straitjackets for the purposes of my judgment i intend to ask myself this simple question did the decision maker act fairly towards the plaintiff
4272789 ameliorating the collateral damage caused by collateral attack in administrative law
4272790 an objectionable offence a critique of the possession offence in the films videos publications classification act 1993
4272791 dunne v canwest tvworks ltd enhancing or undermining the democratic and constitutional balance
4272792 the democratic party remains staunchly behind a womans right to choose an abortion
4272793 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade the 1973 supreme court ruling granting women a constitutional right to abortion and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion
4272794 we could truly make reducing the abortion rate in america a non partisan issue and a bipartisan cause it is a common sense approach
4272795 so i think it would be a bad judgment on senator obamas part to select someone who was in conflict with the church
4272796 30 year history of advocating and acting in support of legalized abortion
4272797 there are many goods you are trying to weigh where you have someone in public life who is not living in their public responsibilities consistent with the catholic faith i think you are concerned about that individual
4272798 one of the things that i said when i met with the governor at one point is that some day shes going to have to stand before god and account for her public service and i hope that shes going to have something better to say than what she does to this point on the protection of the innocent unborn but i said if you go to god and you say well i didnt understand how important this was or i didnt understand that this was such a crucial issue then as your bishop im the one responsible because i didnt do enough to try and make sure of that i told her i wasnt comfortable with that and so i wanted to make sure that she understood what a serious matter this was
4272799 i think you have concern for that individual and in wanting to try to bring about enlightenment and conversion you also have a concern for the rest of your people thats the problem with the individual thats in a public position when they act contradictory to their faith then it can create within the church what the church means by scandal which means leading others into error
4272800 frankly after the pastoral action i did take with the governor
4272801 there were several people who communicated with me that we didnt realize how extreme she was
4272802 i also am concerned about young catholics that are thinking about public service and public life
4272803 they cant go the road of these so called pro choice catholic politicians and really be faithful to your faith
4272804 to my mind you have to pursue it in that way you have to attempt to meet with the individual instruct the individual make sure that youve given them every chance to consider their position before you take extreme action
4272805 to my knowledge she hasnt gone to communion since this second request to her so in that sense from an indirect way shes honoring the request
4272806 she has not communicated with me at this point at all and shes told other people in the media that shes going to respond to me personally but that hasnt happened at this time
4272807 what i found out after i took the pastoral action with governor sebelius is that senator obama had her on his advisory committee for catholics
4272808 but i hope that it alerted senator obama that this is not probably somebody that can really counsel you in terms of the mind and the heart of the church on this very critical and important area
4272809 so i think it would be a bad judgment on senator obamas part to select someone who was in conflict with the church
4272810 we can have a serious impact on the positions that the individuals and parties are taking
4272811 i think that the political parties read the results of the election and then put an interpretation on it after this election theyre either going to think we need to be more aware of these values about the sanctity of human life the importance of marriage and its traditional understanding being upheld or theyre going to think these are things we can either ignore or the tide is with us to go against what has really been the tradition of western civilization
4272812 creo que cualquiera estar a presionado al hacer ese argumento
4272813 la distancia entre dobson y obama en cuestiones de interpretaci n b blica es precisamente la distancia entre el ala teol gicamente evangelica estadounidense y el resto del pa s

4272825 strife between negotiators for sen hillary clinton and sen barack obama are exaggerated and the two sides are nearing an agreement on how clintons delegates will participate in the formal nominating process at the democratic national convention according to advisers to both democrats
4272826 some clinton supporters are coming across as wanting to use november as political payback rather than advancing their own candidates political agenda which is more similar to obamas than to mccains
4272827 now were going to have some fun with these c s

4272840 he has to put top priority on governability and avoid ideological conflicts in order to really tackle the countrys crucial problems
4272841 the evidence leads us to believe that the spending of the ministries budget funds is aimed at emptying out the coffers of certain key institutions in order to deprive the government that will take office on aug 15 of a minimum level of funds needed for the actions it plans to carry out
4272842 i would be satisfied if the new government fulfills the three basic points it promised in the campaign
4272843 we expect higher balance borrowers to receive both rate relief and increased liquidity as was desired in the legislation while retaining the overall liquidity of the tba market this arrangement preserves the overall homogeneity of the market while at the same time minimizing the risk of a negative impact on mortgage rates for lower balance loan borrowers or potentially all borrowers
4272844 we expect the market to smoothly digest the change made under the new sifma guidelines and continue to provide liquid and efficient pricing for mortgage securities
4272845 the importance of preserving the liquidity and stability of the tba market cannot be overstated

4272862 and i think that maybe theyre like we dont show up which is what i guess front runner means theyre only on your side when youre winning
4272863 there are definitely games dont get me wrong where im like damn you know we are getting booed and we need to get booed because were not doing well
4272864 the whole thing was look here we are in the playoffs were at home were in first place theres really nothing to boo about were not going to win every game as long as we win by one when it comes down to the finish but go out there and support us when carlos ruiz comes up to the plate dont boo him because you want chris coste in the game this man has a job to do today encourage him to do his job to the best of his abilities
4272865 the term front runner and what it actually means and to what i was using it what was going through my mind they werent accurate front runners is like people who only show up when youre winning hey were going to cheer you if you win thats not it about philly fans theyre passionate they show up like i said 45 000 weve got like 42 sellouts they announce it everynight thats not what i meant like i said its the fact that here we are at this point of the year come out and be supportive dont necessarily get on us we can use that positve energy and you know that positive energy can lift you that negative energy can bring you down

4272871 protecting our environment and addressing climate change a sound energy strategy must include a solid environmental foundation
4272872 the skyrocketing price of food has created a desperate situation for the worlds poor this grant will allow us to provide immediate relief to hungry families and help people feed themselves in the long run
4272873 mercy corps has been a very important partner of the foundation helping channel critical assistance to people in real times of need
4272874 this assistance transcends the immediate crisis and we rely on our partners such as mercy corps to help lay the groundwork for long term solutions that will not only increase small scale farmers productivity but will help them lead healthy productive lives
4272875 but as the fighting subsides and displaced people return home we will focus on longer term recovery of housing schools and livelihoods and then on reconciliation among people on all sides of this conflict
4272876 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4272877 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4272878 the information we have available to us first of all is the air corridors are open weve seen no indication they are blocking roads

4272883 i had plenty of them last week thats for sure
4272884 its always nice to get one early in a tournament
4272885 i only slept two hours so it was tough to get up early in the morning
4272886 but im very pleased it was tough out there today with the wind
4272887 ive not played a good round in what feels like forever but i played some really really great golf there
4272888 a few weeks ago my mind was somewhere else and it was driving me insane but youve got to turn the corner somewhere so hopefully this is where it starts
4272889 it should have been a fantastic year but its turned into a horrid one on and off the course for me and my family
4272890 it would have been the easiest thing to say im not going to bother but my mum wanted me to do everything i could to make the ryder cup

4272896 i thought to myself these crusty old mountain guides can live till they are 90 so i thought we had another 30 years together
4272897 we are looking to have all of these issues discussed under the un umbrella
4272898 extremely concerned by the humanitarian impact of the recent conflict on the civilian population in georgia which has suffered loss of life and injury significant damage to property and infrastructure

4272901 serving them and their families a fresh hot pizza is just a small way we can say thank you for their service
4272902 i have been very impressed by the great care and support that the chinese government has given to its people in and around chengdu
4272903 its obvious to see they have been able to accomplish so much in terms of health welfare and displacement facilities for those in need the chinese people have great resolve and resiliency
4272904 it was a moving experience for me to meet with those who have lost so much and have been obviously grief stricken and suffered great losses and still see they have a burning light of love and hope in their eyes i was deeply touched
4272905 i came here to see what happened in chengdu the boxing event we were planning prior to the earthquake is now taking a back seat to the humanitarian concerns in sichuan province
4272906 this rallying cry is being lived up to by the government and the people uniting the country for a quick response which epitomizes humanitarianism and the spirit of the heart
4272907 there are day laborers in all parts of the county and i think it would be great for city councils in this area to take a look at that los angeles ordinance and consider it as a model for something that could be adopted elsewhere
4272908 this is a broader social issue that goes beyond the home depot and the solution is more complicated than placing mandates on businesses
4272909 the response required the movement of additional forces into south ossetia because tskhinvali was attacked by a powerful force
4272910 this was the use of sophisticated weapons against a small town against a sleeping people this was a barbaric assault
4272911 giving young children real guns to handle is inappropriate it could be glamorising the weapons and creating familiarity which is plainly wrong
4272912 the foolish display at this festival can serve only to normalise firearms or make they appear attractive even glamourous
4272913 we are tragically used to seeing images of primary school aged boys handling assault rifles in liberia or mogadishu but in limehouse
4272914 none of the weapons were able to be fired they are all completely deactivated
4272915 we wanted to convey to the kids that although this weapon is deactivated if you point it at a police officer they wouldnt know that
4272916 this is an ongoing programme and the whole idea behind what we do is to divert people away from gun crime
4272917 weve done this kind of thing in other places and its been very successful and we will continue it in the future
4272918 i told the mayor we are not going to try this case in the press i have never done that during my career i truly believe the system works best when jurors are allowed to come into the courtroom without being blitzed with publicity for months ahead of time

4272989 in til buscar un programa de recuperaci n que sea consistente con el pago de la deuda fijada por nuestros acreedores
4272990 nuestros peque os productores agr colas son masacrados por la brutal injusticia del entorno del comercio internacional
4272991 en la globalizaci n el campesino o campesina pierde su identidad social cultural y econ mica de productor ahora un campesino es consumidor de semillas y qu micos caros que venden las poderosas corporaciones trasnacionales por medio de poderosos latifundistas y prestamistas locales
4272992 a menudo lo han hecho en unos t rminos muy desfavorables para los granjeros pobres dejando a estos con m s inseguridad alimentaria y a los gobiernos a depender de unas ayudas internacionales poco predecibles
4272993 muchas de las empresas privadas que vinieron a reemplazar a los investigadores estatales resultaron ser monopolistas en busca de dinero
4272994 no pensamos que el coste humano de esos programas seria tan grande y que las ganancias econ micas tardasen tanto en llegar
4272995 el sector paraestatal continuar a siendo un riesgo para la exitosa implementaci n del presupuesto de 2002 03 las intervenciones del gobierno en la agricultura y otros mercados alimentarios est n socavando otras inversiones m s productivas
4272996 you know mac was a storyteller pryor was the king of storytelling and in a very special cultural way you know pryor just like bernie whether you grew up in his neighbourhood or you were around his lifestyle he painted the picture and made you see it
4272997 and i dont see how pryor couldnt have been an influence he was an influence on all of us
4272998 i dont like it when you talk behind peoples back
4272999 factoring in pressures of power space large capital expenditures global performance and availability issues companies are faced with an exploding challenges and costs to go with the exploding storage demand
4273000 companies must take a new approach to storage they need to move from the old and out dated storage 1 0 model of do everything yourself to a new storage 2 0 cloud model
4273001 a ver el lugar de reposo de mat as catrileo el fue mi hermano mi amigo que me acompa en los d as de prisi n fui a rendirle homenaje
4273002 porque yo no ten a factura para comprobar que los 180 000 que se robaron eran m os
4273003 yo siento mucho sufrimiento estos a os que el hijo est preso son un dolor muy grande la comida no la puedo aprovechar la como entre l grimas a ra z de este problema de los que llevan la justicia me he enfermado tuvieron que llevarme al hospital espero que dejen en libertad a mi hijo y me lo entreguen en buenas condiciones como estaba l al ser detenido
4273004 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later
4273005 it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4273006 we had made these arrangements for this round of negotiations before the conflict in georgia and so we just merely continued with the schedule we had
4273007 we believe that missile defence is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
4273008 the clear language of the artistic license creates conditions to protect the economic rights at issue in the granting of a public license these conditions govern the rights to modify and distribute the computer programs and files included in the downloadable software package the attribution and modification transparency requirements directly serve to drive traffic to the open source incubation page and to inform downstream users of the project which is a significant economic goal of the copyright holder that the law will enforce
4273009 given the courts powerful endorsement of the structure and language of artistic 1 0 well probably see more projects adopting artistic licenses and more new licenses emulating them
4273010 you simply cannot make a comparison from the animal model they used to humans
4273011 for all we know using moisturizers in humans has improved skin health and has been protective against skin cancer
4273012 there is simply no correlation that can be made thats the bottom line
4273013 this is a pretty artificial situation with the mouse skin primed by a lot of uv light to develop cancer
4273014 most people even in their 20s have dry skin on their legs especially in the winter and do need to moisturize there
4273015 you only need to moisturize if your skin needs it those with oily skin dont need to add extra moisturizing
4273016 it would be nice if the companies could do more in terms of testing their products
4273017 todav a no se ha hecho la devoluci n pedida de las cintas y del respeto al derecho del secreto de las fuentes eso independiente que la ley no lo consigne porque esto no significa que no sea leg timo se ha pedido al ministerio de interior por medio de su subsecretario felipe harboe y a trav s de la ministra de cultura paulina urrutia pero la verdad estamos a la espera de una conferencia de prensa del ministerio de cultura la que todav a no se da

4273019 es imprescindible un pronunciamiento formal y p blico de parte del gobierno de chile que incluya la defensa integral del trabajo period stico y documental

4273023 i actually wrote a song for my new album called my baby its a real beautiful song
4273024 francis stated that he planned on exposing how exactly mr wynn deceives his high end customers with reckless disregard for the truth
4273025 im changing my name because master p is who i used to be i call it my childhood and p miller marks my manhood people grow mentally and spiritually through life experiences
4273026 when you come from hip hop its almost impossible to move past the stereotypes associated with it
4273027 ive branched out into so many different arenas that range from being the first african american to have a clothing line at wal mart to writing books and speaking on capitol hill but all that gets overshadowed because i come from the hip hop industry
4273028 we really need to get over this love affair with the fetus and start worrying about children
4273029 no woman wants an abortion as she wants an ice cream cone or a porsche she wants an abortion as an animal caught in a trap wants to gnaw off its own leg
4273030 i have met thousands and thousands of pro choice men and women i have never met anyone who is pro abortion
4273031 and by the way my belief is that if men were the ones getting pregnant abortions would be easier to get than food poisoning in moscow
4273032 too many people in america believe that if you are pro choice that means pro abortion it doesnt i dont want abortion abortion should be the rarest thing in the world i am actually personally opposed to abortion but i dont believe that i have a right to take what is an article of faith to me and legislate it to other people thats not how it works in america
4273033 abolition of a womans right to abortion when and if she wants it amounts to compulsory maternity a form of rape by the state
4273034 the question isnt where life begins but where biologically independent life begins
4273035 why why why why why why is it that most of the people who are against abortion are people you wouldnt wanna in the first place boy these conservatives are really something arent they theyre all in favor of the unborn they will do anything for the unborn but once youre born youre on your own pro life conservatives are obsessed with the fetus from conception to nine months after that they dont wanna know about you they dont wanna hear from you no nothin no neo natal care no daycare no headstart no school lunch no food stamps no welfare no nothin if youre preborn youre fine if youre preschool youre conservatives dont give a about you until you reach military age then they think you are just fine just what theyve been lookin for conservatives want live babies so they can raise em to be dead soldiers
4273036 my love of everything that is gilded and excessive my passion for luxury and my love of oriental clothes

4273040 todas somos coordinadoras cada una de nosotras desde su organizaci n nacional no necesitamos formar una nueva instancia organizativa para la cumbre de mujeres
4273041 estamos preparando la cumbre de mujeres ind genas con la m s amplia participaci n para plasmar de manera conjunta la dif cil situaci n de los pueblos ind genas del continente y construir propuestas no solo para las mujeres sino para todos desde una mirada de mujer
4273042 by no means clear that the house of laity would support legis la tion whose inevitable consequences would be the exclusion of faithful anglicans from the church of england
4273043 not a necessary conclusion we are being encouraged by friends in other historic churches to con tinue to struggle for the catholic identity of the church of england
4273044 it is essential that we behave with grace and charity towards everyone
4273045 remember too that some speeches in the general synod and reactions since have shown us that there are many people including bishops who do not agree with us about women bishops but do not want to see the marginalisation or ex clusion of our contribution from the ongoing life of the church of england
4273046 that has serious im plica tions for lots of people includ ing us
4273047 as a whole constituency not just forward in faith we have al ways made it quite clear that juris diction is not our top line its our bottom line there is a kind of na ve stupidity about that it is a nego tiating ploy but it is not nothing else will do that view is shared by all 14 bishops
4273048 i dont think i have ever known an atmosphere like there was in york a wilful disregard for fellow chris tians
4273049 if the bishops show they are willing to deal with it themselves and take it back it can be redeemed but im not over optimistic
4273050 the protestant low church teachings the liberal experiential teachings are just not true their italics the catholic faith the catholic practice the catholic teaching is true
4273051 what was not pos sible 20 years ago may be possible to day
4273052 what arcic was asking for was unity with rome and remaining anglicans
4273053 the anglican church has taken a distinctively protestant sectarian move the question jack is asking is can part of the anglican com munion do what the whole com munion was going to do
4273054 i felt i had been ungra cious however since it has emerged that at least two of the bishops op posed to the ordination of women to the episcopate voted against the amend ment because it did not pro vide sufficient assurances i have felt that i had been right after all
4273055 legitimising in the life of the conference and by implication in the communion the whole range of convictions about same sex relationships and about the use of scripture
4273056 strongly coloured by the well organised and well funded activities of groups and individuals lobbying against the communions teaching expressed in resolution 1 10 and for that publicly advocated by the episcopal church and those who think like it
4273057 everything had been managed to ensure that opposing and mutually incompatible views should be held in tension
4273058 best and most fruitful way forward for the anglican communion
4273059 recognition that a covenant clearly has to have some teeth
4273060 a huge achievement the anglican communion has not had over arching structures capable of bearing this strain
4273061 people came to realise that they wanted us at all costs to find ways of staying together in one communion recognising the huge loss if we do not
4273062 the liberal bishops who came to lambeth very doubtful about the concept of the covenant the more conservative bishops and provinces clear it was needed
4273063 one of the key changes in the anglican picture as a result of lambeth is the enhanced authority of archbishop rowan conservatives and liberals alike as well as all those of us who dont fit either label were inspired by his scholarly gentle and holy leadership
4273064 ours was beautifully led by a gentle spirited sudanese bishop anthony poggo
4273065 it was not possible for anyone to go to a meeting and slag off what someone had said while keeping their own powder dry
4273066 we are delivered in this country from cyclones poverty rampant hiv and tb compared with the things that are decimating people around the world we have more opportunity to give our attention to the things of god the gospel of christ than others have you feel slightly censured that were not more about our task because we have relatively so many fewer distractions than those in the developing world
4273067 season of gracious restraint for some time and i dont see there is any church wide push to end that in the coming months
4273068 the general convention is going to have to consider these issues general convention is the only body that really can decide to do anything significant related to them individual bishops have always made their own decisions within the canonical responsibilities of their dioceses
4273069 inappropriate and needing to cease that said im not terribly hopeful that they will stop
4273070 an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might there fore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faith fulness
4273071 and thus as providing the authoritative basis on which i as archbishop speak
4273072 no individuals speculations about this have any authority of themselves our anglican church has never exer cised close control over what individual theologians may say
4273073 dr williams has made a split inevitable in the anglican church
4273074 because marriage has other dimensions to do with children and society
4273075 in the context of a powerful and clearly thought out address as the fresh articulation of the mind of the church not as an opinion which he was bound to express but from which he privately wanted to dissent
4273076 he has our full and unqualified support in his magnificent leadership both of the church of england and of the anglican communion
4273077 an old thing and looked pique ish because the lambeth conference had achieved a greater harmony
4273078 rowan played a blinder at the conference showing masterful leader ship in a non pejorative and non belligerent way it was very subtle
4273079 in the past raised questions about this the fact remains that the church is not persuaded i am loyal to the church which has asked me to serve so the authority that i accept has to be the authority of the whole body
4273080 if strict measures are not taken there is a danger of mass disease
4273081 535 sites have been documented covered with concrete and fenced off
4273082 we were able to buy only 2 000 650 doses of anthrax vaccine for animals with the money allocated in the budget that is only 30 percent of the required amount we requested 126 million soms about us 3 7 million for the departments work but so far we have received less than a half of the requested amount
4273083 to implement all planned tasks for 2008 2012 we need 42 million during talks with representatives of the eu the international epizootic bureau the world bank the asian development bank and a number of european states and members of international community verbal agreement to provide funds was given
4273084 we are very scared about anthrax among cattle and people one person has died
4273085 everything you need to take and print brilliant borderless 4x6 inch photos
4273086 item will ship out from the manufactory located in hongkong directly if this type out of store in the location please accept my sincere apologize of this inconvenience to you item will be shipped by registered air mail it takes 7 15 working days for delivery
4273087 since camecos quarterly results vary significantly comparing todays results to our record second quarter last year is not a good indicator of future performance
4273088 we will continue to benefit from our uranium contracting strategy which will provide upside benefit from rising market prices and protection should prices fall
4273089 without pity or mercy all men women and children of polish descent or language only in this way can we obtain the living space lebensraum we need
4273090 all poles will disappear from the world it is essential that the great german people should consider it as its major task to destroy all poles
4273091 joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
4273092 this isnt 1968 the predecessor state of russia the soviet union didnt care about its international reputation because it wasnt attempting to integrate into international organizations it wasnt attempting to be a part of the prosperous and forward looking europe the russians have said that they do want to be a part of that prosperous and forward looking international community and frankly theyre doing great damage to their ability to do that
4273093 the greek tragedy aspect of this election could turn out to be george bush defeats john mccain twice
4273094 theres a lot of what they call buzz going around in the blogosphere right now that barack obama will choose the governor of virginia this guy tim kaine to be his running mate
4273095 insiders say hillary was never on obamas vp list obama felt it would have been too much to put her on the ticket bad enough to worry about jesse cutting them off didnt want to worry about hillary breaking them too you know what im saying
4273096 barack obama says that next month hes planning on spending a week on vacation in hawaii
4273097 and according to the tv show extra former vice president dan quayle remember him hes in the running to join the cast of dancing with the stars thats true dan quayle you remember he was vice president under the first george bush see that was back in the day when the president was smart and the vice president was an idiot now of course everythings turned around
4273098 we felt it was too serious an issue to be put on television portrayed as fact what was in fact fiction
4273099 we made clear that it would have been grossly irresponsible to air this movie in its original and ideologically driven form
4273100 i havent gotten any indication this is ever going to be seen again
4273101 they used to say money and profits dictated everything in hollywood
4273102 the path to 9 11 had a huge viewership yet it didnt mean a thing
4273103 youd like to see an organization dedicated to the freedom of creative expression right here in town come forth
4273104 the purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse
4273105 its a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long if anything the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways
4273106 all of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems
4273107 just as we say that leatherback turtles are critically endangered i looked at entire ecosystems as if they were a species
4273108 the reality is that if we want to have coral reefs in the future were going to have to behave that way and recognize the magnitude of the response thats necessary to achieve it
4273109 the challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes in fisheries agricultural practices and the ways we obtain energy for everything we do
4273110 the purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse
4273111 its a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long if anything the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways
4273112 all of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems

4273114 the reality is that if we want to have coral reefs in the future were going to have to behave that way and recognize the magnitude of the response thats necessary to achieve it
4273115 the challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes in fisheries agricultural practices and the ways we obtain energy for everything we do
4273116 we hope that the number of bookings made through these scam artists these ticket touts has fallen as a result of publicity
4273117 we have not changed the guidance but you dont need to be a genius to work out oil is not at 130 a barrel
4273118 well probably call it wrong again well probably wait too long for oil prices to fall
4273119 part d continues to come in under budget achieve consistently high satisfaction rates and with it millions of americans are living healthier better lives
4273120 most beneficiaries will see a premium increase in their current plan there will be some significant increases
4273121 first there is a trend in prescription drug cost growth generally prices tend to increase because of price increases for existing drugs the growth in the average number of prescriptions per person and the introduction of new drugs
4273122 so they have adjusted their 2009 bids to reflect those higher than anticipated costs
4273123 in addition 97 percent of people in stand alone prescription drug plans will have access to a 2009 plan with equal or lower cost premiums than their 2008 plan
4273124 moreover many medicare beneficiaries will have access to a medicare advantage plan that offers lower prescription drug premiums than a stand alone plan
4273125 we are paying for better outcomes and we are getting higher quality and more value for the medicare dollar
4273126 and these results show that by working in collaboration with the physician groups on new and innovative ways to reimburse for high quality care we are on the right track to find a better way to pay physicians
4273127 our trial was not powered on a difference in clinical outcome between the two groups however we noted a better clinical outcome in the tirofiban group than in the placebo group with lower overall mortality and less urgent repeat primary coronary angioplasty
4273128 reveals that high dose clopidogrel is not effective enough and confirms the need for fast and strong platelet inhibition it reminds us also that the first contact with the patient must be rapid and medical until now only well organized hospital systems have been able to provide such a service
4273129 these data should not lead to guideline modifications combined with previous studies this study supports the notion that use of single agents to block the renin angiotensin system is well tolerated
4273130 americans to have the chance to see the effect on homegrown
4273131 its almost like hes not human because he swims so fast
4273132 im pretty glued in fact i stayed up until two oclock last night
4273133 ive gotten flooded with emails and calls from parents who want to get their kids involved in competitive swimming
4273134 there were a lot more pools built in the seventies thats a fact i had read
4273135 i compare my times to his and see how much faster he is
4273136 vi har l rt hvad der kan ske n r aggressorer f r frit spil
4273137 i g r h rte jeg senator mccain sige nu er vi alle georgiere okay meget fint i ved meget opl ftende for os at h re men okay nu er tiden forpasset til det fra ord til handling
4273138 den kedelige sandhed er at vi dels p grund af afslutningen p den kolde krig dels fordi de skyh je oliepriser fyldt ruslands pengekister har meget lidt indflydelse p hvad russerne g r i det mindste i forhold til hvad de ser som deres egen interessesf re
4273139 vores topledere udstiller kun dette faktum h jt og tydeligt n r de udsteder ultimatumer der bliver ignoreret uden konsekvenser
4273140 mellem stlige krige har efterladt usa ude af balance og i bekneb for ressourcer
4273141 amerikanerne har mere brug for rusland end russerne har brug for amerikanerne
4273142 ive seen the pictures of the baby she looks like john edwards
4273143 of course i love you dont worry well get through this
4273144 imagine if hunter was blackmailing edwards for money or for more money since she was already being paid a monthly stipend and if she were pressuring him by leaking information to the national enquirer and if she tipped off the enquirer to the july meeting including such details as the number of rooms rented and who was in them
4273145 this is a picture of john edwards and rielle hunter together it may be the only photograph it was taken at a dallas book signing in 2006
4273146 i didnt hang out with her that much i was more of a goody two shoes
4273147 she was always hanging with the upperclassmen going to parties
4273148 im not sure if well pull the trigger or not
4273149 were trying to get our best players at every position across the board including on special teams and he has an aptitude for it
4273150 the bottom line is its a difficult proof level to say someone gave money intending it to be used in a terrorist attack in the united states as opposed to merely giving it to anti american groups and foreseeing it
4273151 ultimately al qaida couldnt have done the attacks if they didnt have the resources to train and equip the 19 terrorists
4273152 even if the four princes were reckless in monitoring how their donations were spent or could and did foresee that recipients of their donations would attack targets in the united states that would be insufficient
4273153 my wife forget it shes on the floor in tears
4273154 na ja ich w rd ja linux benutzen aber das ist ja alles so kompliziert und ich
4273155 i think we all went into this with the realization and the understanding that if we can take one gun off the street then it was going to be deemed a success
4273156 a lot of people said no no no thats not going to work but they proved the point it did work
4273157 we have more people who are active now because they realize that the more you speak the more you can receive
4273158 its unlike anything weve seen in the trading card category
4273159 if the dairy knives never leave the dairy side of our luxuriously small kitchen they can never get confused
4273160 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colours seen in sunsets on the red planet
4273161 we are now ready to start doing scientific experiments that will add a new dimension to measurements being made by other phoenix lander instruments
4273162 to realize buddha in this body is to realize that you yourself are in fact the universe
4273163 every human being is a metaphysician just as every philosopher has appetites and emotions and by this i mean that we all have certain basic assumptions about the good life and the nature of reality even the typical businessman who asserts that he is a practical fellow unconcerned with higher things declares thereby that he is a pragmatist or a positivist and not a very thoughtful one at that
4273164 the heart of zen is not an idea but an experience and when that experience happens and happens is just the right word you are set free from ideas altogether certainly you can still use them but you no longer take them seriously
4273165 i can have the feeling self only in relations to and by contrast with the feeling other in the same way i am what i am only in relation to what everything else is the japanese call this ji ji mu ge which means that between every thing event ji and every other thing event there is no mu barrier ge each implies all and all implies each
4273166 thats a chance for reiff to defend his job and give sort of a job performance review to the people about what hes done
4273167 its also a chance for the allen county people to interview me and find out ok is this man we hired doing his job or do we need to look at another candidate
4273168 i do agree with commissioner greg sneary that this is a chance for us to really make a difference
4273169 there are a lot better places where that money could be used i probably would not have voted for that i would have had to do some studying on that
4273170 we had talked about spending that much more to tear down the building and make another vacant lot out of it
4273171 to tear the building down and make a vacant lot wed still have to refinish that side of the civic center god knows how much more we would spend if we tore the building down i dont know where the lose part is
4273172 we have a lot of things going for us and a lot of resources but theyre not being pulled together and communication is lost
4273173 youve got an independent and you have a republican so we need the voice of different people on the commissioners
4273174 the diversity helps get a different perspective on things and maybe just maybe with a little cooperation we can get things moving forward if you have the same and the same and the same how can you ever have any new ideas or change
4273175 grasshopper manufacture is excited to work with ea partners to bring our new title to gamers around the world
4273176 they are a great partner who shares our commitment to quality and innovation while respecting our independence as a studio which is very empowering
4273177 this is the highest level i ve ever played at i ll learn some things that s for sure
4273178 a champion comes out in the face of true adversity that s what we did today
4273179 it s a privilege to do this it s an experience i never thought i d get
4273180 its just a matter of there being winners and losers
4273181 the african development bank has established the african fertilizer financing facility afff which is going to be a multi billion dollar facility that will allow african countries to be able to import fertilizers
4273182 ratings are also held back by wide prosperity disparities which constrain policy flexibility
4273183 at about 1 377 per capita income is significantly lower than the bb median 3 047 or levels registered in other oil producing countries
4273184 when more industries are closing down the minister of industry should resign what they do is to go to china trade expo attend birthday wedding and burial ceremonies of politicians and do not show concern for industries here
4273185 the president should give performance criteria to all his ministers any minister who is not performing should resign the president should bring in ministers who are ready to work to drive the industry the minister is currently watching while industries close down
4273186 as someone from the private sector the minister should have known better but has so far been watching more industries closing down
4273187 nigeria needs industrial emergency with defined targets to improving capacity utilisation capital adequacy and labour absorption to revive the textile industry
4273188 when government showed adequate interest in reviving the industry there were barely 50 companies operating at 30 percent capacity utilisation compared to 175 mills in the mid 1980s
4273189 within the last two years more than half of the remaining 50 mills had further been shut down and the largest textile group in the country the united textile unt was not immune from this closure

4273191 it is believed that if african leaders observe the rule of law the continent will be a more peaceful place
4273192 historic moment showing brotherly celebration of cooperation between the two countries
4273193 the gains made in adhering to the rule of law may outweigh the painful losses of ancestral homes
4273194 in gori we have two church congregations who are very involved in looking after the poor and destitute but they have had to leave the city and hide in the rural villages and hope the russian bombers do not find them there in the peace cathedral in tbilisi we have a 24 hour prayer circle praying for a peaceful resolution for the conflict
4273195 this time this conflict has been started by a third party that is russia there is a sense of powerlessness and help lessness because there is little we can do except pray that is very important
4273196 these bonds are both of a theological spiritual nature and also involve engagement in a number of social projects
4273197 the use of force has cost the precious lives of civilians and soldiers risks destabilizing a fragile region and reawakens deep fears there and far beyond
4273198 there appears to be a complete absence of anything remotely to do with religion at the games
4273199 the emer gence of the enormous globe out of the ground to represent the one world one dream motto of the games best reflects this
4273200 the fact that we protestant leaders are invited to the opening ceremony means that chris tianity is now more integrated into the society and the government respects religions and society accepts us
4273201 a number of chinese bishops have been detained or placed under house arrest
4273202 the attached text is to be considered binding for its part this congregation is confident that the universal use of these texts will greatly contribute to the building up of the faith throughout the broad and diverse english speaking world
4273203 marked by a heightened style of english speech and a gram matical structure that is based on the latin text
4273204 a great improve ment on the current one i e liberals have lost all sorts of liturgical battles
4273205 the grammatical construc tion and rhetorical style of the prayers give the rite as a whole a distinctly archaic feel which is in stark contrast to its predecessor the departure from the use of ecumenically agreed texts will undoubtedly be a cause for concern

4273207 why does it seem like my job is to gather everyones opinions instead of sharing my expertise in interaction design

4273213 ive got more than 1200 items and its anything that i find a bit peculiar rather than something that would have been successful or other people would collect i dont collect sewing machines or typewriters he said
4273214 its things that perhaps nobody else would be bothered with but in some way helped normal people with their lives like the self pouring teapot or the dynamo torch
4273215 a lot of the items could still be produced today even the self pouring teapot mr collins said
4273216 the most bonkers invention here is the coffee cooler he said of the circa 1920 metal cylinder which would be plunged into a piping hot cup
4273217 why would you want to do that why not just blow on it and it displaces half your coffee
4273218 britain was a phenomenal nation of inventors but things have changed he said
4273219 nowadays its got to be manufactured abroad and the system of selling has become quite difficult i think 1851 to 1951 was the golden age
4273220 inventors are all quite vulnerable and naive at the beginning we really need advice so its great to have somewhere to go he said
4273221 you have to be pretty determined and it helps if you have some basic skills
4273222 im here to nurture inventors and point them in the right direction you never know whats coming through the door

4273248 this gives us the opportunity to play around more to elaborate more on an issue or a message
4273249 you are definitely probably reaching a younger or at least a tech savvy demographic
4273250 honestly i think they are experimenting theyre trying to see who would they reach who is out there who is following them what kind of audience can they get
4273251 but you can link people to more information and get them so they can read and see more so they can see more and i would say the campaigns that are trying this right now need to tighten things up more and be more clear and effective with their messaging
4273252 the crime here is that people think they can protect themselves against inflation by investing in a bond that increases its principal by a flawed inflation gage like the cpi
4273253 the signs were seeing in the tips market right now are very conflicting
4273254 prior to this latest report on thursday the ppi producers price index has been running hot while the cpi hasnt been going up much at all
4273255 but now that the cpi has really jumped inflation is bound to receive more attention from both consumers and investors
4273256 while some goods and services are clearly going to be more expensive others are clearly going to be cheaper
4273257 it doesnt appear to be one of massive hyper inflation that would most benefit an etf
4273258 they work much like a tips fund but a cd will protect your principal as well which is appealing to more conservative investors interested in holding tips as part of their long term allocation strategy
4273259 there are more direct and efficient ways to hedge against inflation
4273260 its an etn exchange traded note so it guarantees you the return of the underlying index

4273263 what we like about timber is that even if the economy isnt doing well you dont have to harvest the field

4273268 quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in thenext little while as to whether or not this parliament canfunction productively
4273269 two of the three opposition parties dont support thegovernment and say we should be defeated mr dion says hedoesnt support the government but wont say you know whetherhe will defeat us or not
4273270 the choice is either to let this government govern or tolet the people decide i am telling mr dion he should decidefor good and soon

4273276 it is extremely important to maintain our existing store base in a tough environment with significant competition for customers whose disposable income is shrinking
4273277 we believe that ksss inventory management initiatives and increased private and exclusive brand penetration helped to mitigate the margin pressures exerted by the companys lackluster sales

4273279 we assigned a negative outlook to mbia due to itssignificant exposure to domestic nonprime mortgages and relatedexposures to collateralized debt obligations cdo ofasset backed securities abs
4273280 the negative outlook on ambac reflects our view that thecompanys exposure to domestic nonprime mortgages and relatedexposures to cdo of abs has likely damaged its franchise andthat the company faces diminished new business flow
4273281 the slowing that we have seen in the united states is moving to other developed countries
4273282 in asia we believe the business will be robust by comparison but from our view there is evidence that the economy continues to slow

4273294 we will honor the spirit as well as the letter of the agreement
4273295 in the long term theres not going to be fewer students
4273296 theres going to be fewer recent high school graduates and so our programs also serving adults and on the graduate level in that market people just continue to need the education and so were in the right market
4273297 one of the options for the first assignment called on them to create a magical curse tablet or erotic charm and so far ive received everything from

4273309 selama ini kita tahu bahwa rasa bahagia akan membuat fisik kita menjadi sehat tapi kita tidak tahu persisnya bagaimana
4273310 kesedihan atau rasa kurang bahagia kronis mengaktifkan respon bertempur dalam diri kita artinya kondisi ini bakal mengancam diri sendiri karena jangka lama bakal membuat kita sendiri hipertensi dan respon kekebalan tubuh menurun
4273311 jika kita merasa tidak sehat kita akan pergi ke dokter umum
4273312 jika kita merasa tidak bahagia tak ada ahli dalam hal itu kita harus mengupayakan sendiri
4273313 hanya saja pertahanan kami tampaknya perlu perbaikan namun kemenangan ini sangat menyenangkan kami semua
4273314 mungkin kami agak kalah dari klub denmark itu dalam hal ketajaman dan stamina tapi itu tak boleh jadi apologi kami harus bangkit sebelum akhir pekan ini kemudian mencoba melakukan pembalasan di leg kedua nanti

4273316 when you live in a small town in the middle of ontario it would have been too big of a dream to say that you want to go to hollywood but secretly i think i always knew when i was young i was a figure skater and every year there was an ice carnival i lived for the carnival thats when the actress in me first came out i loved the costumes and the sparkles one year i got to play marilyn monroe on ice i danced to diamonds are a girls best friend i wore a long blond wig and a red dress with sequins it was heavenly
4273317 i had a small town life i worked at the local mcdonalds for three years im not sure why they kept me i am something of a daydreamer and a dawdler so they would only let me be the friendly voice that greeted you when you entered the restaurant i was slow i would be organizing the sweet and sour packets in the customers takeout bag while the line snaked out the door even at a fast food restaurant i wanted everything just so
4273318 theyre strange a kiss with anyone on or off camera can be intimidating ive been kissing for nearly two decades now and im always convinced im not doing it right chemistry is so important in a great kiss you can act your way through anything but its hard with a kiss its much better if theres an attraction
4273319 i dont like to work all the time when im working the rest of my life slips away i press pause on everything and then when im done working i get back to the world im trying to interpret in the movies i have a split personality i love being completely immersed in my nonworking life but i am equally compelled by the lives of the characters i play if you want to tell stories as truthfully as possible you have to have a normal boring existence otherwise youll never understand the greatness of the everyday
4273320 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4273321 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4273322 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4273323 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4273324 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4273325 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4273326 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4273327 wir vermuten zum beispiel dass sich westliche und stliche halbkugel unterscheiden
4273328 when she looked at it she determined that due to flooding the river could actually could have been up to that level where the bones were found at that time it deserved a second look
4273329 at the end of all that process the dna remaining inside the bone samples themselves is in very poor shape and it makes it very difficult to retrieve any dna out of it
4273330 for instance if we have some found human remains and we develop a mitochondrial dna type from there we can now compare that type to suspected brothers or sisters of that individual we can also look at mothers and aunts or female cousins along that line
4273331 thats very useful because it can be very difficult to track down relatives and get dna to have some comparisons to do without the relatives we cant make any identifications at all
4273332 you could use mitochondrial dna on a brand new sample like a blood stain or a hair sample or you could use it on very very old degraded samples like skeletal remains teeth even shed hairs from very cold crime scenes
4273333 the attorney general asks that the appeal be heard as soon as there is available time to hear it
4273334 the implications are significant what were talking about is an order declaring an important law of no force and effect
4273335 the government should be doing their work as we speak
4273336 the civil liberties association like the plaintiffs themselves is responding to what in essence is a health care crisis in the downtown eastside
4273337 dance shows always do well but it has to be adapted for trends working on tv
4273338 its quite a positive show theres not a lot meanness that may exist in other reality programming
4273339 for a lot of people it reminds them of the time when tv wasnt so hostile
4273340 our show was really more about watching the creativity happen and contestants learning the choreography in a different sub genre each week
4273341 dancers are dramatic and emotional and i think its really compelling to watch
4273342 what these shows have replaced is what we no longer have a large support for the arts
4273343 the government no longer supports the arts theyre not fed like they were
4273344 weve seen a big increase in interest since the shows went on air
4273345 weve done a lot of ballroom classes and choreographed dances for weddings dance is on the brain
4273346 of course some of these shows are not for the dance purist
4273347 but it has such a domino effect on dance and getting people to think about dance its really just fantastic
4273348 people know the difference they see how hard these dancers work and realize that its a skill
4273349 at the same time it may inspire them to learn something new
4273350 the family they have questions and they want answers and no one is doing nothing about that
4273351 they dont feel the mothers pain they dont feel what were feeling
4273352 they come in there and they do what they want to to whoever they want
4273353 police have to work very hard and show the people they are very sincere
4273354 there were people there at the shooting and they know exactly what happened and they are waiting to see how they police are going to handle it if they see that its completely different who knows what can happen
4273355 theres a reason it didnt mention the carbon tax policy
4273356 thats because its a bad policy for atlantic canada it would hurt families here it would hurt industries here and thats why theyre not talking about it
4273357 we are going to make sure that atlantic canadians are not tricked into voting for a carbon tax that would damage the region
4273358 it will drive up the price of everything transportation groceries electricity heating even propane for our bbqs
4273359 this carbon tax has been the hidden agenda of the liberal party for years
4273360 i think quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
4273361 mr dion says he doesnt support the government but wont say whether he will defeat us or not i dont think thats a tenable situation
4273362 this is the prime minister who made a virtue of passing fixed election date legislation and now hes threatening to cross sussex drive and go see his neighbour the governor general and ask for an election because hes fabricating a crisis where none exists
4273363 a major part of whatever is dysfunctional is coming from the government side he is choosing to cover over that which is another reason why people dont trust mr harper
4273364 we are going to make sure that atlantic canadians are not tricked into voting for a carbon tax that would damage the region
4273365 it would hurt families here it would hurt industries here
4273366 the protester got what it asked for which was clarification of exactly what is required
4273367 there was no mystery to us as to what the requirements of the system were in the past
4273368 rather than favoring one company or the other our view is that it favors the war fighter
4273369 my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet
4273370 the good news is we have classrooms for all of those students inside of our building we have teachers fully staffed in all of those classrooms
4273371 weve got over 7 800 available seats in our elementaries and were still just about 7200 so we have plenty of room
4273372 if you had a second high school most people would assume it would have the same ammenities as that high school and that would not be good stewards of the taxpayer dollars
4273373 if you think you know what the hell is going on youre probably full of shit
4273374 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4273375 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4273376 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
4273377 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4273378 the birds have to make a judgment do they expend most of their energy flying long distances to the uk where they know the winters are likely to be mild and where they will find food or do they save energy take a shorter journey but then risk their food supply running out
4273379 these are the choices forced on them by climate change
4273380 this years report shows that climate change is with us already and from our gardens to our seas birds are having to respond rapidly to climate change simply to survive
4273381 as often before birds are acting like the canaries in a mine shaft and giving us early warning of dangerous change
4273382 the consistent declines in specialist bird species highlighted by this years report indicate that the variety and richness of our countryside is being lost
4273383 we urgently need to act to reverse the loss and fragmentation of important habitats if our wildlife is to stand any chance of adapting to climate change
4273384 its unlike anything weve seen in the trading card category

4273416 ive been working on redecorating my living room and i came across this mid century white chair and ottoman in immaculate condition at a vintage antique store in my east nashville neighborhood i like to think that it belonged to some little old lady who kept it in her pristine living room oh and it was 175 00 for both pieces definitely a great find for me
4273417 the attached pic is one of my favorite pieces it is a reproduction oval marquetry tray with brass handles the inlaid pattern is a classic urn design i paid about 50 for it on ebay ive seen the real thing for hundreds of dollars so i was happy

4273419 heres my favorite piece an old pine hutch with a history
4273420 my secretary is my favorite piece because it was my mothers its not so much that its such a valuable antique but more that it was in my house growing up and it was given to my mother by her mother its a 1940s piece and i love the tiger eye maple and secret compartments it has inside
4273421 my favorite piece is my coffee table the most used amp favored piece of furniture in my house it is a baker swivel top coffee table from the 1940s or 50s im guessing the 4 main reasons i love it a it cost 75 on ebay b the entire top swivels like a big lazy susan which is so convienient c it has brass goddess faces on the legs these sort of caryatid faces d it is very useful as well as cool looking my 4 year old eats his breakfast on it every morning his little batman chair fits under it perfectly he plays with his action figures on it we play cards on it we rest our feet on it just love this table one day i will have it refinished but for now i clean it with orange glo once a week amp it looks pretty good for all the use amp abuse it gets
4273422 i got it at an estate sale and it was marked 500 and i got it for about 75
4273423 my favorite piece is a solid marble mortar with 2 wooden pestles it is so heavy that when i want to move it both my husband and son have to carry it it was first used by my grandmother in the early 1900s she used it to grind meat can you imagine what they went through just for hamburgers lol it now sits on my dining room buffet and is often the topic of dinner conversation it measures 12 inches high and 18 inches across i simply love it its very sculptural

4273425 guns violence threats theft schools should be safe havens one of crime stoppers greatest abilities is the one that we protect the source these kids know whats going on inside their schools we figured if we can make sure they can find a way to pass us that information they never have to get involved theres no fear of retribution no one will never find out who they are and they can receive a cash reward and get the drugs and the violence out of these schools right now
4273426 whats actually going to happen with that text message and the way it becomes anonymous the information is passed to a server in canada the server in canada will strip down any of the information of the sender and forward it to texas they send it to us and the entire process takes about 3 to 5 seconds
4273427 i think its a good idea because thats what most of the kids do now they dont talk a lot they just text
4273428 i like that a lot a lot of kids are nervous to actually talk on the phone and then a lot of teenagers theyre more comfortable texting any how i think that will work and help them to open up some

4273438 its things that perhaps nobody else would be bothered with but in some way helped normal people with their lives like the self pouring teapot or the dynamo torch

4273440 the most bonkers invention here is the coffee cooler he said of the circa 1920 metal cylinder which would be plunged into a piping hot cup

4273442 britain was a phenomenal nation of inventors but things have changed he said
4273443 nowadays its got to be manufactured abroad and the system of selling has become quite difficult i think 1851 to 1951 was the golden age
4273444 inventors are all quite vulnerable and naive at the beginning we really need advice so its great to have somewhere to go he said
4273445 you have to be pretty determined and it helps if you have some basic skills

4273485 lexp rience de lann e derni re nous a appris deux choses premi rement le co t des traitements devrait v ritablement exploser dans les ann es venir si aucune mesure nest prise pour lutter contre cette tendance deuxi mement il ne faut pas attendre des entreprises pharmaceutiques quelles r solvent ce probl me un changement radical de strat gie simpose a d clar le dr tido von schoen angerer directeur de la campagne dacc s aux m dicaments essentiels de msf vu le niveau actuel des prix il ne fait aucun doute que le co t de lacc s aux nouveaux m dicaments signera la faillite des programmes de traitement et malgr cela les gouvernements lindustrie pharmaceutiques et les agences multilat rales sont loin de s tre activement attaqu s cette question
4273486 cest lexistence de m dicaments g n riques un co t abordable qui a permis dintroduire les th rapies antir trovirales dans les pays en d veloppement explique le dr von schoen angerer les programmes th rapeutiques choueront si un approvisionnement continu en versions g n riques de ces nouveaux m dicaments nest pas assur
4273487 de nombreux nouveaux m dicaments ne sont m me pas disponibles dans les contextes o nous travaillons car leur enregistrement nest pas une priorit pour les firmes pharmaceutiques pr cise le dr moses massaquoi qui travaille pour msf au malawi il est tout simplement inacceptable de devoir attendre tant dann es pour pouvoir utiliser des m dicaments couramment utilis s dans les pays riches quand ils finissent par arriver

4273492 des investissements massifs sont n cessaires pour le d veloppement et la mise disposition le plus vite possible et des prix abordables de nouveaux tests de diagnostic et de nouveaux m dicaments
4273493 en guin e comme dans dautres pays en d veloppement nous avons de plus en plus de patients qui ont d j suivi un traitement anti tb et qui reviennent vers nous avec des sympt mes de la maladie

4273498 conscients que laction humanitaire nest quun palliatif temporaire inappropri et co teux ce type de situation nous avons pens que le moment tait venu dengager un v ritable dialogue avec tous les partenaires gouvernementaux internationaux et communautaires qui oeuvrent pour un meilleur lendemain au sahel

4273501 nous avons besoin de tenofovir pour un nombre de plus en plus lev de patients mais son approvisionnement par gilead nest pas r gulier nous ne pouvons donc pas mettre davantage de patients sous traitement avec ce m dicament
4273502 nous craignons que l pid mie soit hors de contr le
4273503 alors que le chol ra se r pandait d j un rythme tr s lev hier il a commenc pleuvoir cela ne fera que compliquer la lutte pour arr ter l pid mie
4273504 les autorit s doivent augmenter consid rablement les fournitures m dicales et le nombre de travailleurs de la sant mobilis s pour combattre le chol ra elles doivent en faire bien davantage en ce qui concerne loffre deau potable la population dans et autour des zones touch es des campagnes dinformation doivent galement tre mises en place rapidement afin de sensibiliser les angolais aux mesures prendre pour pr venir linfection y compris dans les provinces qui nont pas encore t atteintes par l pid mie
4273505 pour linstant nous avons t en mesure de traiter toutes les personnes infect es par le chol ra qui se sont pr sent es dans nos centres
4273506 mais la tendance actuelle de l pid mie laisse penser que nous verrons beaucoup plus de cas dans les jours et les semaines qui viennent nos centres chol ra fonctionnent au maximum de leurs capacit s sans une intensification consid rable de leffort des autres acteurs en commen ant par les autorit s nous risquons de voir mourir un bien plus grand nombre de personnes

4273525 nous demandons nos patients si au cours des trois derni res semaines ils ont travers des moments o ils se sentaient un peu mieux
4273526 cest important quils commencent utiliser de petits moments positifs quils ont v cus comme une ressource dans laquelle ils peuvent puiser quand ils en ont besoin et pour nous il est galement essentiel d couter lexpression de leur motion ou de leur tristesse

4273535 it will have been something that got onto the radar of americans but not right in front of them if thats the case i would probably still argue that its of some marginal benefit for mccain

4273541 i like mccain compared to obama but it makes me wonder is this the best the nation has to offer

4273622 weve out recruited the republicans and we have great candidates that really fit the district
4273623 people are tired of the partisan politics theyre not going to go in and vote democrat or republican theyre going to look at each candidate

4273626 i finally said so youre telling me this is a death sentence she said yes it was the single most horrible moment of our lives
4273627 children are born normally they may be noted to have kinky hair or curly hair but then around 3 to 5 years of age they lose milestones
4273628 if we dont find a cure or a treatment for it children tend to lose their ability to walk by age 12 and then they lose the ability to speak and eat food and ultimately it takes their life
4273629 there is no one driving the research the funding the organization the networking nothing so we decided to be the first so we started the foundation for gan called hannahs hope fund

4273678 immediately open an investigation to determine whether a violation occurred and if so to take all appropriate steps to remedy that violation of federal election law

4273681 we wanted a safe cream that we could put the caffeine into
4273682 wed like to understand the mechanism what is most important is to see whether these moisturizing creams are tumorigenic in people
4273683 i dont think that people should be scared because this is a mouse study and we dont know whether or not it applies to humans
4273684 this is a pretty artificial situation with the mouse skin primed by a lot of uv light to develop cancer
4273685 non melanoma skin cancer in man is very very common and is almost 100 percent curable with an operation usually simpler than a tooth filling
4273686 they are things that are commonly used in many moisturizing creams
4273687 if tomorrow mr saakashvili signs the document that we have negotiated with russian president mr medvedev then the withdrawal of russian troops can begin
4273688 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4273689 this is going to be a defining crisis in the united states russian relationship the danger is that neither side feels it can back down
4273690 we may only be at the beginning of this crisis rather than at the end of it
4273691 i have heard some threats that they will not accept us into the wto but no one has so far even tried to allow us to join it
4273692 you defended your land and justice was on your side
4273693 that is why you won with the assistance of russian peacekeepers i think that is an appropriate outcome
4273694 we have information that american military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to tbilisi airport though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago
4273695 lets ask them will they invite you the media to check whether it is humanitarian or not what is in it the cargo in reality it is of major concern to russians
4273696 we have finally got understanding of our point of view that poland being a crucial partner in nato and an important friend and ally of the united states must also be safe
4273697 since i have to get energy from somewhere and i just cut myself off from the primary source i will go to the next best source gods children and i will steal cajole manipulate until i get them to give me their energy i will set up my own fiefdom with gods children as my vassals they will get the energy from god and i will get it from them
4273698 if i cant prove the existence of god with my intellect and my outer senses then there is no god
4273699 if i cannot measure him with the extension of my senses i e my technology then god doesnt exist
4273700 i defy anyone to prove to me using my criteria that god exists
4273701 there is none so blind as he who will not see

4273741 its like nothing that phoenix has seen yet because of the variety thats involved the various genres that are being portrayed as well as times in history
4273742 what we wanted to do was give the belly dancers some inspiration of areas to go with their skits and their pieces
4273743 so we wanted to have it be kind of like an old village meets traveling through town circus kind of thing so weve got vagabonds tramps some of the girls are doing kind of oldy timey vintage pieces some of the girls are doing stuff with kind of a circus theme involved so its as if a circus of belly dancers came through town
4273744 what were trying to do is instill the feeling of other countries where you go through the bazaar and these people are shouting out haggling yelling to and fro

4273764 evolutionary psychologists have suggested that sexual fantasies contribute to the facilitation of sexual arousal which in turn facilitates procreation thus sexual fantasies may play an important previously unrecognized role in the continued propagation of the human species on the other hand freudian pyschotherapists and psyschoanalysts by contrast have speculated that our fantasies may have developed as a means both of gratifying wishes and conquering intrusive memories of early traumatic experiences during childhood

4273772 je ne retournerai jamais l bas je pr f re rester ici et mourir la seule pens e de men approcher me terrorise
4273773 je suis devenue comme folle il fallait que je la voie jai pris un taxi et je lui ai demand de memmener lh pital naturellement c tait impossible il a refus car je navais pas le laissez passer appropri alors jai d cid dy aller pied et soudain jai r alis ce que je faisais

4273777 cela fait maintenant plus dun an et demi que nous attendons de pouvoir donner aux patients vivant avec le sida et co infect s par la tuberculose la formulation promise par merck qui leur permettrait la fois de vivre mieux et de mieux adh rer au traitement nous sommes r ellement fatigu s dattendre mais le v ritable probl me est quil nexiste aujourdhui aucune version g n rique de lefavirenz merck est donc en position de faire payer son m dicament au prix que lui seul d cide et de tarder encore pour lancer lenregistrement de son produit en afrique du sud la pr valence de la tuberculose parmi les patients vivant avec le vih sida est tr s lev e nous navons donc aucune alternative que dutiliser ce m dicament ce qui rend les trith rapies trois fois plus lev es que les autres combinaisons de la m me classe et qui sont elles disponibles en version g n rique
4273778 il semble donc que loffre de merck pour les pays en d veloppement consistait surtout attirer lattention sur son produit et augmenter ses parts de march dans les pays riches
4273779 si merck avait v ritablement eu lintention de rendre lefavirenz plus largement disponible dans les pays en d veloppement le laboratoire aurait imm diatement commenc lenregistrement de son produit dans les pays concern s sit t apr s son annonce et en m me temps diminu le prix des comprim s de 200 mg nous invitons aujourdhui le laboratoire merck tenir ses promesses et r duire imm diatement le prix de ses comprim s de 200 mg la seule formulation defavirenz aujourdhui largement disponible

4273846 at the age of nine he was awakened and made a subject of converting grace under the preaching of the methodist ministry though he made no profession of religion at that time
4273847 russel bigelow was born in chesterfield new hampshire february 24 1793 he was converted and joined the methodist church in his thirteenth year
4273848 he continued to grow in grace avoided the company of the thoughtless and gay sought the society of the pious and was derisively called by his young acquaintances the deacon or the old deacon
4273849 i think it would have been better had i remained single a few years longer
4273850 russel bigelow had in settlements and larger towns of ohio won the distinguished honor of being the greatest pulpit orator of the west and some ministers it is said were jealous of him and had a pliant bishop send him to the wyandots
4273851 this man had imbibed skeptical sentiments which he often inculcated with terrific energy he rarely went to the house of god and when he did i supposed he might as well stay at home for i should have thought it easy to melt a rock with a fagot as to subdue his heart by the foolishness of preaching
4273852 one saturday evening he came into our office with a peculiar expression of countenance the tear started from his eye as he said i have been to meeting and by the grace of god i will continue on as long as it lasts come young gentlemen come and hear bigelow he will show you the world the human heart and the bible and the cross in such light as you have never before seen them
4273853 he announced his theme the departing of the scepter from judah the coming of shiloh and the gathering of the people to him
4273854 he preached with such energy and power that the whole membership of the church were roused to new zeal and earnestness and the impression did not subside during the year i have heard mkendree george roberts bascom durbin simpson and many others preach great and powerful sermons but never did i hear preaching attended with such divine power as bigelows
4273855 during his stay in xenia he preached one sermon never till then had i the slightest conception of his intellectual strength the power of his logic the beauty and variety of his imagery or the overwhelming force of his eloquence it was an occasion never to be forgotten his sermon was in 1 st peter 1 st chapter 3 rd and 4 th verses i cannot give the general arrangement of the sermon it contained an elaborate argument on the doctrine of the eternal sonship of christ i had read watson and clarke and heard the doctrine discussed from the pulpit frequently but never with such strength of argument and clearness of conception presented on that occasion he was perfect master of all arguments i had heard or read and in addition he presented proof and demonstrations to me entirely new

4273889 dans nos programmes le nombre de patients trait s avec une seconde ligne de traitement est encore peu lev mais le co t de ces traitements est exorbitant explique le dr felipe garcia de la vega sp cialiste du sida pour la campagne dacc s aux m dicaments essentiels de msf
4273890 nous assurons plus de 40 000 consultations par an dans les deux h pitaux de galkayo explique colin mcllreavy chef de mission de la section hollandaise de msf en somalie mais cela est peine suffisant les gens doivent parcourir plus de 700 km pour se faire soigner faute dautre solution dans ce pays ravag par la guerre civile lacc s aux soins m dicaux est pratiquement impossible le pire est cependant de savoir que m me si nous soignons beaucoup dhabitants bien plus encore meurent parce quils nont pas acc s aux soins
4273891 la population civile continue d tre la principale victime de laugmentation de la violence port au prince au cours des derni res semaines

4273894 ce soir on ne mange pas demain matin un peu de riz
4273895 je suis devenue comme un enfant je ne suis pas en tat de travailler je suis l du matin au soir et je ne sais pas quoi faire pour sortir de cette situation
4273896 i will blot out man whom i have created from the face of the land man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens for i am sorry that i have made them
4273897 that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time
4273898 without the holy spirit and without grace man can do nothing but sin and so goes on endlessly from sin to sin
4273899 this knowledge of our sin is the beginning of our salvation
4273900 we completely despair of ourselves and give to god alone the glory for our righteousness in christ
4273901 where is the promise of his coming for ever since the fathers fell asleep all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation
4273902 its obvious that the working group has already been set up but we havent been contacted which i find interesting as we are the only provider of tertiary education to indigenous people
4273903 a welfare only response to these communities is precisely the wrong way to go weve got to get housing right weve got to get education right weve got to get health right but weve also got to get jobs right
4273904 we are short of people we are short of skills so there is not a better time to take this initiative
4273905 a travers nos programmes daide m dicale dans les territoires du masisi et du rutshuru nous sommes t moins dune situation alarmante
4273906 les personnes d plac es ont souvent d fuir plusieurs reprises depuis plusieurs ann es et sont aujourdhui bout de forces la difficult dacc der aux soins la malnutrition les pid mies mais aussi les violences exerc es contre les civils sont lorigine de cette grande vuln rabilit
4273907 mais un petit panier de g teaux ce nest pas beaucoup pour nourrir toute une famille
4273908 that was only a mere ruse de guerre as they say in the noosepapers
4273909 as we havent time to waste talkin philosophy to a puddin why into the bag he goes or well never get the story finished
4273910 ces quipes mobiles bicyclette ont ainsi certainement vit la mort denfants et de personnes vuln rables qui seraient sans cette aide rest es bloqu es chez elles
4273911 les femmes accouchent souvent la maison et viennent nous voir trop tard
4273912 500 jours de d tention sans savoir de quoi demain sera fait sans savoir sil quittera sa ge le vivant cest un v ritable cauchemar
4273913 nous appelons une nouvelle fois les parties en pr sence faire tout leur possible pour quarjan soit rel ch imm diatement
4273914 mais un petit panier de g teaux ce nest pas beaucoup pour nourrir toute une famille
4273915 nous sommes ici aujourdhui pour demander au pr sident poutine quil assume ses responsabilit s et garantisse une lib ration rapide darjan erkel et pour demander aux pays membres des nations unies de tenir le pr sident russe pour responsable de l chec jusqu ce jour des autorit s dans cette affaire
4273916 si la nouvelle r solution adopt e par les nations unies en faveur de la s curit des travailleurs humanitaires a un sens le pr sident poutine doit assumer ses responsabilit s en mati re de respect du droit international humanitaire en faisant avancer les recherches et en obtenant quarjan soit lib r sain et sauf il doit aussi permettre laide humanitaire datteindre ceux qui dans le nord caucase en ont cruellement besoin
4273917 non seulement les traumatismes ont sur les enfants un impact imm diat mais ils risquent dentraver leur d veloppement leur capacit apprendre ou tout simplement tre heureux
4273918 si les enfants et les adolescents ne sont pas trait s apr s un v nement grave qui provoque de la douleur et de la souffrance ils deviennent de plus en plus vuln rables des v nements m me beaucoup moins importants ils sont nu leurs blessures m me invisibles sont b antes et pour certaines ne cicatriseront pas sans aide
4273919 il est absolument scandaleux quapr s une ann e enti re notre coll gue arjan erkel soit encore port disparu cette situation est la cons quence dun manque flagrant dimplication des autorit s russes et dune enqu te men e avec fort peu de conviction
4273920 la pr sence de deux agents des services secrets russes lors de lenl vement darjan aurait d accro tre leur motivation r soudre lenqu te or notre grand d sarroi lenqu te a t arr t e en novembre 2002 pour n tre r ouverte quen mai dernier de surcro t nous nen avons jamais t inform s au contraire pendant tout ce temps les autorit s nous ont assur quelles faisaient tout ce qui tait en leur pouvoir pour assurer la lib ration darjan
4273921 il est extr mement difficile de comprendre pourquoi les gouvernements ont t si r ticents demander aux autorit s russes de prendre leurs responsabilit s dans la r solution de cette affaire
4273922 nous ne sommes plus totalement d sempar s nous contenter de regarder nos patients mourir inutilement nous fournissons des arv qui transforment la vie de nos patients

4274053 all i know is that this was once a small fishing village it was built about one hundred and fifty years ago you can see that it hasnt really changed that much since then

4274056 youve had people offer to buy your company but youve never taken the deal how come i didnt get into this for the money so im not going to get out of it for the money that was never the point for me in the dot com boom you saw people start a business with good intentions but the investors wanted bigger returns so owners began to compromise their original intentions and started mildly screwing people once that happens they have to shut down because people know they are getting screwed or the owner sells the business and becomes miserable because what started as a golden egg turned into a rotten egg to me its failure when what you set out to create becomes corrupted even if you are making a lot of money

4274073 other studies have reported a similar relationship between ear infections and overweight we did not find evidence for the reverse hypothesis larger and heavier children were more prone to ear infections and tubes than smaller and lighter children
4274074 surprisingly we found that the single best predictor of body weight was not how much saturated fat they took in and not how often they ate high fat foods but was how much they liked high fat and sweet foods
4274075 particularly with damage to the taste system and we think this happens from ear infections
4274076 taste does have an impact on selection of food and diet
4274077 a may damage one of the nerves that carry taste information in addition ear infections can also alter taste altering taste does have an effect on the preferences for food
4274078 it certainly makes sense that variations in taste due to many factors including a history of ear infections could influence food preferences total food intake and weight
4274079 so while the link between taste buds and vulnerability to obesity is worthy of further exploration the simple fact is that the entire population is vulnerable to obesity
4274080 the major causes of the obesity epidemic reside in the obesigenic environment rather than on our tongues
4274081 the response required the movement of additional forces into south ossetia because tskhinvali was attacked by a powerful force

4274310 our nation has been attacked we are at war if you see anyone who looks like they dont belong you should report it to the authorities
4274311 we dont need pelosi to save the planet because jesus already did
4274312 were pleased with the ruling and will proceed forward as appropriate
4274313 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4274314 i think what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of u s russian relations
4274315 my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4274316 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4274317 if tomorrow president saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start
4274318 i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia

4274321 jeff was so convincing that i knew we had to go
4274322 yuschenko and the other mothers wanted to minister to their children to take care of them to find the resources they needed and to have a place to meet and care for the special needs of their handicapped children
4274323 when i first met lena several years ago and found out about her desire to care for the handicapped children here in konotop i was sure that we would be able to help them to buy a little building in konotop which is where the hearts of love center is now located
4274324 sponsors have been attracted by eeo to help establish and maintain the center
4274325 many families in this area of ukraine have children who have handicaps eeos goal as a mission organization is to partner with people churches and other organizations to help these children and their families
4274326 were excited about whats happening here the people are helping themselves
4274327 our job is to compliment what the local people are doing and get this konotop hearts of love center finished the kids deserve it the parents need it and the good news is that theyre being saved theyre being brought to good health
4274328 we can resource them with not only a place to come to but also with the physical equipment physical education and by working with them physically as well as spiritually and emotionally
4274329 when energy and oil prices go up on top of inflation health care and core food items there is a great deal of pressure on the customer
4274330 in an environment where many retailers have recently reduced fiscal year 2008 expectations we believe results and guidance are strong enough to support the current stock price and drive continued outperformance among its competitors
4274331 essentially if the progress report graded the progress made in combating drunk driving wisconsin would receive and f
4274332 we also see a national survey that found 26 percent of drivers have admitted to driving under the influence in the last year the worst state in the nation
4274333 if we get that kind of help then what we do on labor day weekends and crackdowns will make a difference
4274334 my son dan died driving intoxicated on november 10th of 1996
4274335 he was living in wrightstown and he was at a bar in green leaf and when he left the bar he made some unwise choices like to attempt to drive himself home
4274336 my son dan lost his life he lost everything at 21
4274337 he never got to see life or enjoy life its just so senseless and so wasteful
4274338 sign on young man and sail with me the stature of our homeland is no more than the measure of ourselves our job is to keep her free our will is to keep the torch of freedom burning for all to this solemn purpose we call on the young the brave the strong and the free heed my call come to the sea come sail with me
4274339 pardon him theodotus he is a barbarian and thinks that the customs of his tribe and island are the laws of nature
4274340 and those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music

4274343 if i dont know a pitcher im not going to swing at the first pitch in the first couple at bats so i can see what hes going to throw me sometimes that does set him up for later in game
4274344 its frustrating for a pitcher whos trying to paint the corners and a guy is not swinging and hes getting ball one ball two ball three
4274345 so the pitcher says im going to throw this first one for a strike and boom home run you have a better chance of doing that if youre patient
4274346 if you take your walks and swing at strikes then you have your base
4274347 if you fish if you swing at the pitchers pitch then you really dont have a plan and youre up there swinging at anything
4274348 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4274349 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4274350 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4274351 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4274352 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4274353 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4274354 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4274355 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4274356 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4274357 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4274358 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4274359 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4274360 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4274361 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4274362 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4274363 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4274364 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4274365 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4274366 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4274367 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4274368 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4274369 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4274370 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4274371 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4274372 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4274373 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4274374 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4274375 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4274376 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4274377 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4274378 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4274379 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4274380 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4274381 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4274382 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4274383 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4274384 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4274385 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4274386 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4274387 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4274388 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4274389 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4274390 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4274391 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4274392 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4274393 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4274394 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4274395 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4274396 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4274397 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4274398 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4274399 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4274400 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4274401 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4274402 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4274403 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4274404 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4274405 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4274406 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4274407 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4274408 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4274409 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4274410 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4274411 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4274412 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments
4274413 they said a wife of one of the ss officers they called her the bitch of buchenwald saw a tattoo she liked on the arm of a prisoner and had the skin made into a lampshade i saw that
4274414 i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis

4274435 there has been no sexual immorality on the part of either todd or shonnah nor has there ever been undoubtedly the pressures and the burden of the outpouring which approaches 144 days on aug 23 have helped to create an atmosphere of fatigue and stress that has exacerbated existing issues in their relationship we wish to stress however that the outpouring is not to blame for the current chain of events and that in effect we have no interest in blaming anyone but rather we deeply covet your prayers for todd and shonnah and for fresh fire ministries during this time
4274436 a central way to help youth counteract distorted views presented by the media and culture about girls sex and the sexualization of girls is comprehensive sex education programs must include accurate information about reproduction and contraception the importance of delaying intercourse initiation for young people and the building of communication skills and promotes a notion of sexual responsibility that includes respect for oneself and an emphasis on consensual non exploitative sexual activity

4274445 we never even considered the possibility they would do it before we asked

4274509 but when you confessed to me everything came rushing back ive never had a problem with gays its just that i was unsure about myself ive been thinking over various things like our jobs our future stuff along those lines but i realised that those things were irrelevant it was just about us i dont know if what i feel for you is more than friendship im sorry

4274524 other studies have reported a similar relationship between ear infections and overweight we did not find evidence for the reverse hypothesis larger and heavier children were more prone to ear infections and tubes than smaller and lighter children
4274525 surprisingly we found that the single best predictor of body weight was not how much saturated fat they took in and not how often they ate high fat foods but was how much they liked high fat and sweet foods
4274526 particularly with damage to the taste system and we think this happens from ear infections
4274527 taste does have an impact on selection of food and diet
4274528 a may damage one of the nerves that carry taste information in addition ear infections can also alter taste altering taste does have an effect on the preferences for food
4274529 it certainly makes sense that variations in taste due to many factors including a history of ear infections could influence food preferences total food intake and weight
4274530 so while the link between taste buds and vulnerability to obesity is worthy of further exploration the simple fact is that the entire population is vulnerable to obesity
4274531 the major causes of the obesity epidemic reside in the obesigenic environment rather than on our tongues
4274532 nono just invited us over for dinner tonight at 7
4274533 that her girlfriend wants to go off and get married to some guy

4274536 i remember the days when she couldnt even boil water
4274537 ta kun said you guys were holding hands when he answered the door
4274538 its early for her but she didnt take a nap today
4274539 sorry i couldnt get in here in time to stop the crying

4274544 cameroonian president paul biya looks forward to new reliable and mutually beneficial relationship between cameroon and nigeria
4274545 it is a day of triumph for the rule of law which lies at the very core of the values of the un
4274546 as painful as it is we have a responsibility to keep our commitment to the international community to advance international peace and cooperation and advance the cause of african brotherhood and good neighbourliness

4274548 it leaves room for some hope for other existing border differences where there are large amounts of natural riches
4274549 guarantees the rights and the protection of the bakassi people
4274550 this is an important agreement for the security of the united states for the security of poland and the security of our nato allies
4274551 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it
4274552 we do take very seriously the concerns of our ally
4274553 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4274554 in five seven or 10 years we want to be sufficiently well equipped and well trained to be ready both with our allies but by ourselves to defend ourselves at a critical moment
4274555 committed to close cooperation with poland in the event of a danger from a third party
4274556 a new element to take our security agreement to a new level
4274557 were facing a new international situation the situation doesnt change our arguments but in my view reinforces them

4274562 despite the jump in inflation readings for july we have rising conviction that inflation readings for august and now even september will be more favorable thanks to the sustained trend in retail gasoline and natural gas prices
4274563 the real eye opener was the jump in clothing prices
4274564 one month is hardly a trend but with import prices jumping we may be now seeing apparel adding to inflation rather than restraining it it is also a warning that we could be seeing price increases in other areas as the import cost rises spread through the economy
4274565 thank you mr president helen thomas at the white house
4274566 i think that presidents deserve to be questioned maybe irreverently most of the time to bring em down a size
4274567 access to a president doesnt mean youre gonna get the truth
4274568 i could see president kennedy was struggling so finally i got up and said thank you mr president i got him off the hook

4274572 the administration is a bit behind the curve on this they didnt understand what was coming
4274573 theres a whole number of issues they deliberately engineer to show they are an important power
4274574 they interpret weakness as a sign that they can go further

4274586 measure patients waistlines and use the waist to hip ratio to estimate stroke risk world health organization defined categories of waist to hip ratio or waist circumference should be used
4274587 the whole vascular risk profile to minimize or modify all possible factors contributing to coronary heart disease stroke and peripheral artery disease

4274589 is an appropriate measure to assess the risk of stroke and tia comparable to waist circumference

4274606 theres going to be even better hitters here the regionals was good but the little league world series is even better
4274607 i dont know if theyre pitching is dominant or their hitting is but well just go at them our hitting should be a great thing were putting a lot of runs on the board weve got pitching to back it up and defense which is really key
4274608 we played pretty close to as perfect a tournament as a coach or manager could hope
4274609 i try to not think about all the fans and being on espn it doesnt make me that nervous
4274610 were getting prepared i dont think were that ready yet
4274611 ever since that game we really caught fire and weve done well hitting for power and average
4274612 the montana game that game opened our eyes and scared em it showed them they cant just show up
4274613 i think during state it was kind of on and off but before the championship game thats when our bats started clicking
4274614 everybodys been saying our hitting is contagious it happens to be true that once a couple people start hitting everybody starts clicking weve been patient at the plate making decisions
4274615 during that whole tournament there wasnt one game where our pitching wasnt phenomenal

4274656 ho iniziato pensando di quanto fossi annoiata dagli eroi del fantasy metropolitano che hanno avuto problemi con la polizia e fanno fatica a rigare dritto mi sono chiesta se questo genere di persone esistono veramente e se si preoccupano delle cose che accadono nella notte e se le forze di polizia senza complicare ulteriormente la loro vita apprezzano laiuto

4274678 the job of the regulators is to assess the long term impact of the alliance on competition not to provide special protection from the immediate challenges of the economic cycle with which every other airline has to deal
4274679 at this point theres nothing standing in our way of continuing to do what we said were going to do

4274694 the administration is a bit behind the curve on this they didnt understand what was coming

4274698 we now have to really pull our socks up in afghanistan with greater numbers more commitment and a better plan and then get in step with the americans we have a chance of winning in afghanistan and we should not flinch from achieving it
4274699 we have achieved what we set out to achieve in iraq
4274700 so it is possible to envisage a mission next year which is in the early hundreds
4274701 bear in mind next year there is going to be a big change in the american mission
4274702 they have now gone from an insurgency to terrorist campaign
4274703 i really am confident that it the peace is going to last and we are not going to see bits of basra go back under militia control
4274704 we were prepared to stand by the iraqis at a very difficult time we were prepared to get rid of tyranny

4274712 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4274713 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4274720 i am surprised but not that surprised given the turmoil in the air force
4274721 it makes sense for new leadership to want to pause and evaluate major projects like cyber command before moving forward the air force is facing severe challenges right now so leadership may want to consolidate its resources before expanding the af cybermission

4274723 mission is to control cyberspace both for attacks and defense
4274724 as airmen it is our calling to dominate air space and cyberspace

4274734 our intent is that we are going to reduce the number of bus stops which will reduce the time buses are on the road resulting in reduced fuel costs
4274735 this plan should have very little impact on elementary students but will mean some middle school and high school students may have to walk farther to the bus stop
4274736 it is evident that the community is not ready to accept such a worthy cause in their community that offers hope to children who are in desperate need of a 24 hour service targeted to them which offers a highly structured and supervised environment in a program setting

4274739 the industry is taking responsibility for correcting a problem they helped create and thats a good thing
4274740 the fundamental goal has been to return money into the hands of investors and thats what these deals do
4274741 there is no doubt this was orchestrated by the abramson and beshear administrations and is another example of mayor abramson going over the heads of the voters so that he can place his cronies into office

4274759 we have a lot of friends and colleagues coming down tonight and hope everyone will join us in celebrating
4274760 i expected it because its the truth and i know the truth always stands firm
4274761 its a great vindication and shows us the faithfulness of god
4274762 my personal point of view the lawsuit was a complete waste of time because the incident didnt rise to any kind of level i fly all the time ive seen a lot worse than that happen on airplanes
4274763 we gave the truth to the jury we are happy we had an opportunity to try our case
4274764 its been better lately but were not rescinding the volunteer rationing
4274765 we dont want to rescind the rationing and then bring it back just a couple of days later
4274766 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4274767 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that senator mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4274768 they used a john mellencamp song until he made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4274769 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4274770 people can catch it in any part of the county we urge the public to take the appropriate precautions to protect against contracting west nile virus
4274771 my call of course is for the territorial integrity of georgia to be respected and for the cease fire agreement to be honored
4274772 shell be coming back to brief me saturday im looking forward to hearing firsthand what she has seen what she has heard
4274773 estamos nela de passagem ent o temos que aproveitar a viagem

4274775 ci siamo ritrovati dinanzi alla cattedrale perche e il simbolo della cristianita e della nostra fede ortodossa
4274776 phallic authority and the i within the film fight club
4274777 there was a time when being a man meant having risked his life to save the world from tyranny and despotism there was a time when being a man meant having learned how to be a man from fathers who all had their own war stories to tell being a man meant having gone through certain rites of passage which were overseen and officiated by other men but those times are long gone
4274778 capitalizes on this sense of lack and awareness of absence
4274779 the feminization and domestication of men in a society driven by consumerism
4274780 the figure of the first person narrator or i often stands in explicitly or otherwise for phallic possession and contain the phalluss symbolic consequences i can penetrate control possess and destroy
4274781 the contents of the unconscious in their deceptive ambiguity supply us no reality in the subject
4274782 the ideal i situates agency in a fictional direction that will only asymptotically approach the subjects becoming
4274783 in the development of selfhood the ability to conceive of oneself as separate from and mutually independent with the parent develops with the ability to accept ones dependency and to feel secure enough to relax the boundaries between self and other without feeling ones identity to be threatened
4274784 if the other is not defined in his actual reality there is only an other me not real others the other may be more or less than i am might have more or less of me
4274785 that gun isnt in your hand its in my hand not my head tyler our head
4274786 inverting something exterior to oneself approximates the murder of the father the overthrow of the ancestor by a son wishing to become an adult
4274787 the imaginary is eliminated and the conjunction of the symbolic with the real is finalized in his jacks self identity and he is named the being of the wholly conscious self
4274788 as the representation of the power that seems to be available to men in social and political terms in a male dominated culture
4274789 what kind of dining set defines me as a person
4274790 rely upon the feminine qualities of support and empathy rather than masculine attributes of strength and virility
4274791 under and behind and inside everything this man took for granted something horrible had been growing
4274792 he doesnt know what he is saying or even that he is speaking
4274793 all the ways you wish you could be thats me i look how you want to look i fuck like you want to fuck i am smart capable and most importantly i am free in all the ways you are not
4274794 if in the mirror stage the image of the whole body is a fantasy of how jack wishes to be then the symbolic version of this misrecognition of coherence occurs and the phallic body stands in for social order
4274795 is an imitation without an origin and that when the original is revealed to be a copy it is an ideal that no on can embody
4274796 all of this the gun the bombs the revolution has got something to do with a girl named marla singer
4274797 signifies both the antithesis of domestic security comfort and sexual passivity
4274798 female masculinity is not simply the opposite of female femininity nor is it a female version of male masculinity but rather very often the unholy union of femaleness and masculinity can produce wildly unpredictable results
4274799 unable to access the power they feel has been reserved for them they tend to project their own misrecognition of the relationship between penises and male power onto the world around them
4274800 marla the big tourist her lie reflected my lie suddenly i felt nothing
4274801 bear the subjects desire phallic power in a masculine mode through an artificial phallus in her fingers
4274802 female masculinities are framed as the rejected scraps of dominant masculinity in order that male masculinity may appear to be the real thing
4274803 the natural is itself posited as a construction of the social
4274804 man and woman are not stable or universal categories nor do they have the explanatory power they are routinely invested with
4274805 the abiding gendered self will be shown to be structured by repeated acts that seek to approximate the ideal of a substantial ground of identity but which in their occasional discontinuity reveal the temporal and contingent groundless of this ground
4274806 private satisfaction and public disorders fight club patriarchy and the politics of masculine violence
4274807 we are concerned with ourselves our own operations our goals and so deliberate about possible courses of action evaluate them decide and carry out decisions
4274808 50 is too easy for me ill go for 60
4274809 ohhh diets you need to follow everything you eat count every calorie and you need to eat only three times per day

4274814 i will have six pack abs and i will lose 6 5 kilograms before the 23rd of june
4274815 god ill never go to the gym its hard and i see no results
4274816 we know from our research that customers appreciate the certainty simplicity and transparency that personal reserve will bring
4274817 five days should be sufficient for the majority of people to return their account to order or contact the bank to discuss the possibility of a temporary overdraft increase the deal is fairer and a big improvement on the previous charging structure
4274818 im currently reading a book written by when people search for the game title author or just books games your website will have content to support the search
4274819 when you first came here you were all about kids lately it seems that all you talk about is test scores

4274824 je vous parle dun temps que les moins de il me semble que serait moins p nible au soleil
4274825 meine pers nliche ansicht ist dass russlands aktionen gegen einen souver nen staat konsequenzen haben m ssen
4274826 remember that game we saw at yankee stadium just before they tore it down when was that 2007 08
4274827 did you make significant gains on the academic performance index
4274828 did you prove your worth on the planet as a charter school
4274829 what about the community of teachers and learners and families who will declare last year a tremendous success who will return from summer vacation energized regardless of what shows up in the box scores
4274830 companies dont have one culture they have as many as they have supervisors or managers you want to build a strong culture hold every manager accountable for the culture that he or she builds
4274831 people are not afraid of change they fear the unknown
4274832 enron has changed things significantly you used to be able to buy a company account for it in bizarre ways and make money on the sale that world is over
4274833 freedom is the greatest when the ground rules are clear chalk out the playing field and say within those lines make any decisions you need
4274834 we are systematically depreciating our human capital for most people the first year with the company is the best its downhill from there
4274835 knowledge sharing is the basis of everything share knowledge with reckless abandon
4274836 think of your team as not just the people you pay but as the people who pay you as well
4274837 the only thing wrong with poor people is that they dont have any money thats a curable condition
4274838 weakness fixing might prevent failure but strength building leads to excellence focus on strength and manage around weaknesses
4274839 everybody throughout the enterprise should know what the brand can and cannot do
4274840 beware of perfect people they will never propel your enterprise to greatness theyre too cautious youve got to be fast to be good
4274841 revolutionary change is where real value is created dont assume the capital markets know what the hell theyre doing the vc market is currently in more disarray than most companies
4274842 networking is sharing your contacts with others to create value without the expectation of compensation your network is your net worth
4274843 every time you give somebody compensation its a great time to give feedback
4274844 if you want to work with people who have no hope you have to look like the solution and not the problem
4274845 we need to get beyond the single bottom line and measure a companys performance by a triple bottom line financial profits alone arent enough the results also need to be good for people and for the environment
4274846 just when you think the sun shines out of your butt all you have is an illuminated landing area
4274847 in these times its important to find the opportunities in the disruptions rather than just to lament the change
4274848 managers consistently delude themselves about how much good theyre doing
4274849 the same thing you want from management is what customers want from you honest communication be honest with your customers tell them everything you know
4274850 when you start thinking about growing your brand be sure not to ignore the spandex rule just because you can doesnt mean you should
4274851 what about the security guard that told us how to find the elevator
4274852 we dont know kira he may have taken the day off like i did
4274853 what about the lady that sold the statue of liberty bears on the ground floor do you think she made it out okay
4274854 we dont know about her either we dont know what time she comes to work
4274855 remember the police officer who sat next to us in the deli wouldnt he have run straight to the building he was so cool didnt he say he lived in san diego when he was doing his marine corps training
4274856 well try to find out guys there may be a way to track him down
4274857 did you hear about the football player that was killed in afghanistan today
4274858 i heard a report that a former nfl football player was killed in a battle in afghanistan
4274859 we wanted to bring the game bang up to date the new characters are more in tune with modern society and with the added touch of a first name more human
4274860 the new rooms and weapons have helped to give the game a much needed facelift and with the added risk of players being killed off mid play we have increased its tempo
4274861 this report is still in circulation and has been very widely read we are determined to clear our name
4274862 the response was very much a human response not so much a sectarian one
4274863 omagh was always distinctive in that there was very little rank sectarianism here and it didnt allow itself to be divided there is a good respect for each others traditions and an acceptance that we should work together on common projects
4274864 the words were using is that the schools would co operate collaborate and be inter dependent this is a positive and creative vision
4274865 there would be cross community sharing between all the different schools the beauty of it is that there is a surge of interest and a quiet excitement about the possibilities
4274866 an inspirational beacon to the world in respect of conflict transformation
4274867 theres optimism around young people are positive and forward looking
4274868 if it could become a model for the type of northern ireland we want to build something good will have come of this
4274869 everybody has their way of coping and my way of coping is to get on with it
4274870 there has rarely been a week when there hasnt been some development relating to the bomb so its very much an ongoing atrocity its not going to disappear in this generation but above all we have amazingly resilient people
4274871 though our hearts are still breaking we must try to smile
4274872 they were often personal outpourings some were written as poetry and some cast him as one of his own poetic characters
4274873 some writers even sent him their own work while others spoke of their own circumstances and how they felt much better for writing to byron many of them were furtive and embarrassed and said can you burn this letter as soon as you have read it
4274874 the fact that he kept them suggests he really did care what people thought and although he struck a pose of aloofness he appears to have treasured these letters
4274875 why did my breast with rapture glow thy talents to admire why as i read my bosom felt enthusiastic fire
4274876 should curiosity prompt you and should you not be afraid of gratifying it by trusting yourself alone in the green park at seven oclock this evening you will see echo
4274877 if this evening proves inconvenient the same chance shall wait you tomorrow evening at the same hour
4274878 i suppose in my life i have received at least 200 anonymous letters aye 300 of love literature advice abuse menace or consolation upon all topics and in every shape
4274879 the fact that byron kept the letters is important he was absolutely fascinated by his own reception and the way he was perceived he even mingled his poetry with his own self creation he pretended not to care about his reader while at the same time making huge efforts to keep track of what his readers thought about him
4274880 my lord tho i have not the honor of being personally known to you i yet venture to address you tho i cannot offer any other excuse for the liberty i take if the irresistible desire i feel of thus unknown paying my humble tribute at the shrine of genius be not deemd any apology i have hung in rapt attention over every line of child harold i am not a critic but an inexperienced young woman but the language of genius amp of nature must be felt amp never makes its appeal in vain to my heart
4274881 my lord you cannot retire to any part of the civilized globe where you will not be followed by the echoes of the worlds applause you must be satiated with the sound of public praise but you may yet endure it in the still small voice of a retired and nameless individual who has admired your splendid abilities from their very dawn
4274882 turn not from this address because the writer is anonymous
4274883 the person who addresses you is a stranger to yourself she never has had and probably never will have even the honor of an acquaintance though a female i have studied your works with attention and think i observed the tragedy of your mind
4274884 the heavy heroin and crack using population is stable and appears to be ageing we havent seen an influx of young people at the bottom end
4274885 there has been a shift in the cannabis market with home grown pushing out the imported stuff but because it is stronger people are smoking less of it
4274886 in order to maintain its position on prohibition the government has to show that all drug use is dangerous
4274887 we need legal control and regulation of drug use that is how we manage use of alcohol and we need the same for drugs
4274888 more people than ever before are getting into and staying in treatment drug related deaths are down and the level of drug fuelled crime has fallen substantially
4274889 qualitativ hochwertige und nach deutschen sowie eu bestimmungen gesetzeskonforme prothetik aus china anbietet die allen medizinischen anforderungen entspricht
4274890 die qualit t des zahnersatzes war davon aber nicht betroffen
4274891 a method of using high quality photographs to enhance a video taken of the same subject the project page gives a good overview of what they are doing and the video on the page gives some really nice examples of how their technology works hopefully someone can take the technology and run with it but one things for sure this could make amateur video making look even better than it does now
4274892 4 could the work be reproduced by one or more skilled graduate students are all important algorithmic or system details discussed adequately are the limitations and drawbacks of the work clear
4274893 not that far below the average of the past decade
4274894 has significantly reduced the banks marginal cost of short term funding
4274895 their cost of funds would have gone up and it is not clear that in the end interest rates to borrowers would have been any lower there are some advantages to the community in having stable and profitable banks so i think we want to be careful saying we want to squeeze down the banks profits there can be unintended consequences for borrowers
4274896 we had our whole lives ahead of us but in an instant that all changed because of someone elses thoughtless decision to drive
4274897 but that doesnt necessarily mean you can safely drive at 0 07 everyones different and the rule should be dont get behind the wheel if youve had anything at all to drink
4274898 this aggressive campaign is an example of our commitment to improving safety on our highways through our efficient use of resources and cooperation from various agencies we will be successful
4274899 our message is simple drunk driving over the limit under arrest the goal is to get impaired drivers off of the roads
4274900 despite our laws we continue to see far too many people suffer as a result of impaired driving
4274901 we apologize for the inconvenience but the order has already been canceled
4274902 barack obama once again demonstrated that his words dont really matter
4274903 people define them as a punk pop band but in this album i only can tell they are pop rock more than any others right to care about teenagers if you want to find some of their songs in this album can define as punk rock sorry it will disappointed you they have made a really good process in this album because as they said they were confused about their style after their first album all the songs that they have made in this album are great this album is just amazing you can tell from this album that they have sold this album most of the time are around teenagers
4274904 is how teenagers want to tell people around them this one would be the most punk rock song in this whole album that i can found so far
4274905 things that wouldnt happen just have to accept it those little things when you listen to it you just know how to deal with it and be happy
4274906 such a database helps the tsa spot patterns of activity that may indicate terrorist planning and refer people to the fbi for possible questioning
4274907 its just like if a police officer chats to somebody its part of the investigative process
4274908 its a fantastic win bob jacobsen and i are very pleased with this result
4274909 for non geeks this wont seem important but trust me this is huge
4274910 if intellectual property had a theme song it would have to be like a virgin
4274911 why because ip is all about the very first time the aha moment the creative spark that gives rise to previously undreamed imaginings
4274912 that you can simultaneously destroy another countrys infrastructure and flatten your own economy at the same time or that iraq had stockpiles of wmds
4274913 so what weve had is a unilateral invasion followed by an occupation
4274914 two of my friends were killed by strong man with sledge hammer
4274915 all us combat troops will leave the country within three years
4274916 the difference is that blackwaters loyalty is not open to the highest bidder and they will not start shooting americans because osama offers them more money
4274917 after a surge of us forces in 2007 helped to push violence to its lowest levels in 4 years
4274918 the proper way to have peace in the world is to take every american and nuke the out of them
4274919 its not that the procedures or the birthing process are that much different
4274920 you give any of these people a written exam and theyd be in the 90th percentile
4274921 were not talking about high fidelity training and thats the beauty
4274922 there are times when a birth is going to happen when there arent any physicians
4274923 whats the point of only training physicians if there arent any around
4274924 live multimedia sound music and visual collage remixing cultural personae incorporating recently discovered allen ginsberg 1950s recordings as well as audio of henry miller tuned specifically for the redwood forests acoustics
4274925 we have duties as citizens we need to honor both or we honor neither
4274926 a public life that excludes god does not enrich the human spirit it kills it
4274927 foundational because the act of dehumanizing and killing the unborn child attacks human dignity in a uniquely grave way
4274928 we become what the word of god has such disgust for salt that has lost its flavor
4274929 i am so thrilled with the reaction from everyone regarding my new album the record was such a labor of love and i couldnt be more proud with the result this is just the beginning of good music to come
4274930 the most impressive song mostly a series of questions aimed at a lover walking out the door but better than the interrogation is the tone which is placid and certain
4274931 the studio marriage of heidi newfield and producer tony brown is a match made in heaven
4274932 once thought of simply as a chick singer for the party hearty trio newfield shows on her solo debut that shes way more
4274933 a startlingly sensitive fully rounded album that reveals heretofore unheard dimensions in both her personality and her talent what am i waiting for is the sound of a woman walking away from the bars and exploring the world outside
4274934 what am i waiting for captures the essence of traditional country females such as making for a refreshing oasis in a landscape of polished pristine pop country music unlike the images churned out on music row life isnt always airbrushed and pretty and newfields music is about accepting life and her past without resignation but with responsibility and hope
4274935 its another opportunity to show that you can play and that you have to be you have to go out there and be consistent and make the improvements on what happened in the last game and show youre growing each day in practice
4274936 its another opportunity to go out there and play as well as i can
4274937 we are using this time in the preseason practice and in the games to evaluate our people
4274938 you would relive scenes from the colosseum from ancient rome gladiators or maybe julius caesar or other things
4274939 there are planning considerations to weigh up because 500 hectares isnt nothing
4274940 that you could have spent your life looking into a microscope instead of a sniper scope
4274941 o homem abriu os olhos e viu a natureza em toda a sua abund ncia e plenitude
4274942 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance
4274943 in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew
4274944 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases
4274945 in accordance with faa procedures for handling these matters we have requested to meet with the faa after we have had time to thoroughly review their findings so that we may discuss the issues since these matters are ongoing with the faa we will not have any further comment at this time
4274946 thank you i really enjoyed and learned a lot this summer bye
4274947 thank you for this opportunity i really enjoyed learning a lot this summer bye
4274948 it is extremely important to maintain our existing store base in a tough environment with significant competition for customers whose disposable income is shrinking
4274949 we believe that ksss inventory management initiatives and increased private and exclusive brand penetration helped to mitigate the margin pressures exerted by the companys lackluster sales
4274950 theyre going to be able to show real newness and freshness and thats whats selling
4274951 the competitive environment is highly promotional and customers are more cautious today however we see no evidence that they are trading down
4274952 within two hours 100 000 people downloaded the new cover
4274953 thats not a lot of people for the internet but about 75 000 people more than went to the last jets game
4274954 they had a great time together but they are just in different places in their lives right now
4274955 he never ends things with a clean slate he likes to dwell on these relationships and sort everything out before saying goodbye for good

4274966 this survey of the american evangelical jesus intends to do more than inform it intends to raise significant questions about the state of christology in american evangelicalism
4274967 and his given shape has much more to say about the shapers than it does of him
4274968 the mistaken conclusion is that because american evangelicals hold firmly and prize sola scriptura it naturally follows that all of the beliefs of american evangelicals naturally flow from the pages of scripture
4274969 a rigorous and detailed and even fought for christology was the lifeblood of the early church early christians recognized that christianity would indeed stand or fall based on how it settled the question of christs identity so they debated
4274970 liberating jesus from his own complexity results in a distorted image of his person
4274971 during the nineteenth century theologians began seeking the freer environs outside of the
4274972 in the broader popular culture of the second half of the nineteenth century jesus had become all too human overflowing with the milk of kindness
4274973 it seems that christ fared better in the confederate camps
4274974 fosdick needed an interpreted jesus by the disciples because he so wanted to reinterpret jesus himself
4274975 fosdick looked himself from the moorings of the biblical teachings of jesus and once loosed he was bound to drift
4274976 it was not of course the spirit of scripture or the spirit of christology for that matter that he was drifting away from it was the letter
4274977 jesus films have difficulty almost by definition depicting the hypostatic union jesus as the god man
4274978 a values oriented message trivializes the most profound and significant message of all time
4274979 american evangelicals cant even seem to realize that christ has become a
4274980 listening to the critics of evangelicalism both sympathetic and not may go a long way to helping see blind spots
4274981 these creeds and the biblical texts they are fashioned from provide the church with its perennial theology which the church in any country in any century simply cannot afford to live without
4274982 american evangelicals have sterling proficiency in the realm of the subjective and experiential but not all of the answers to lifes questions come from within or come from our own time
4274983 vai ser um bom jogo muito disputado sempre dif cil enfrentar o santos na vila belmiro ainda mais nessa situa o que eles se encontram eles passam por dificuldades e a press o da torcida pode atrapalhar
4274984 o santos uma equipe grande e nada melhor que conseguir uma vit ria jogando na casa deles temos condi es de sair de l com um bom resultado

4275059 one concern i have is that this hypothesis has been accepted almost without debate by so many people
4275060 and then some are excluded because theyre not considered severe septic shock
4275061 there were absolutely no patients pulled out before the analysis
4275062 all patients enrolled in the early goal directed therapy study were appropriately selected randomized and examined statistically
4275063 demonstrated that early goal directed therapy yields significant reductions in sepsis related mortality lower organ failure rates and or reduced health care costs particularly due to reduced stays
4275064 routinely given to advance science and treatments for the benefit of patients
4275065 a lot of the experts are turned to by industry for consulting
4275066 i know that these countries they need help all kinds of help and when you come to a developed country i had the chance to train in good universities like mcgill universitys surgery ive been working in an excellent hospital here in sherbrooke and i feel it is my obligation to give some time and expertise to these poor populations

4275080 is that the scarves are knitted or crocheted by hand using delft blue 885 and white 311 red heart super saver yarn because these colors perfectly match the special olympics logo and were chosen specifically by the world winter games organizers

4275082 we really did shout because you suddenly passed out and we tried to wake you up
4275083 you know that nowadays even women of our age can become pregnant
4275084 either they are pregnant or they are extremely emotional were you very emotional before it happened
4275085 maybe you received a proposal of marriage and fainted from excitement ah
4275086 there is a woman here who is how old are you actually what does it matter anyway you look a lot younger and she lost consciousness at the seashore after a meal in a restaurant and she says she did not eat anything that was not good
4275087 and you will admit that relative to the 10th year of pregnancy i am pretty thin
4275088 no i am just a retired doctor who happened to be in the restaurant and saw the woman pass out on the sand and came to help and dont worry
4275089 its a pity you didnt propose maybe you didnt get around to it you can propose now after all she has already fainted
4275090 are you going to suggest that i sniff smelling salts

4275104 for not only is barack the most pro abortion member of the senate with his straight a report card from the national abortion rights action league and planned parenthood
4275105 comes as close to infanticide as anything i have seen in our judiciary
4275106 i think honestly that good white people feel guilty about slavery so theyre overly sensitive about anything pertaining to race kind of like a guy whos a feminist and refuses to laugh when girls call each other sluts
4275107 im sure there are some black people who think its offensive and im like dude shut up first of all its a movie and second of all thats how we sometimes act its only offensive if its not true so i think its going be hilarious
4275108 now can you laugh at it hmmm i dont know maybe with a black guy on your arm

4275113 his infinite wisdom and goodness and is ultimately intended for our good p 67

4275116 when she heard that i had this audition for that she told me you know what
4275117 they told me that these characters might get involved with each other and get some relationship going on there
4275118 then when i watched the past seasons i realized how open it was
4275119 im kind of used to it because every film ive done before im always making love to a beautiful woman or running around naked
4275120 its really deeper than we know and deeper than we get to know
4275121 its hard all i can say is they still have the best doctors working for no money and they still have great athletes take my word for this theyre going to get more medals from beijing than mexico and mexico is a quote unquote democracy
4275122 its fine with me because i think george clooney is one of the greatest actors
4275123 when they mentioned our names for all the different categories i was most proud of jamie being nominated for male vocalist i really thought he was deserving of that
4275124 hes one of the best weve got in this business and to finally see him get recognition after standing behind for all these years is just wonderful
4275125 its always an honor to get nominated and its always a surprise too
4275126 i do not love nuclear or any other source of energy but for me it is important that emissions are as low as possible
4275127 the group has never received remarks by stuk the nuclear safety authority utility tvo or areva regarding the quality of its welding works
4275128 the welders have been left on their own without any competent supervision
4275129 this has been ignored for too long water quality public health and municipal finances are all at risk

4275136 her character is someone who is skilled in healing and a very ambitious woman since her debut choi jung won has been showing different sides of her in her dramas and movies and thus we feel that she is the best person for this role
4275137 i have been resting a lot and this is also my first time taking on a saeguk drama so i am pretty nervous about it i decided on acting in this after seeing the script just once because this role is simply too attractive i hope to show a different side of me to everyone through this role and will do my best to excel in this so that viewers wont feel disappointed

4275144 it reduces our waiting time in line you can mail letters packages express mail priority mail and international letters you can also buy stamps books of 18 for 7 50 or the forever stamps which are good regardless of what the rate change may be
4275145 a strange coincidence around the murder of paul johnson is that the saudi police apparently cooperated with those who abducted him why would a security service trained by american and british c i a fronts like the vinnell corp cooperate with al qaeda their purported enemy this is the second time during the last weeks that saudi security forces have cooperated with al qaeda if this starts happening regularly it would suggest either a very grave instability in the kingdom or that the saudi security forces are run in accordance with american interests
4275146 during the second palestinian intifada the israeli intelligence tried to create an
4275147 on behalf of my people i would like to say that we deny that the terror practices of al qaeda represent islam and moslems in any way we are against the instrumentalization of islam and all moslems by the cia through their front organization al qaeda this disgusting criminal gang has already caused too much death and suffering for innocents of all creeds in many lands we reject the al qaeda announcement to killing innocent people under the name of islam for revenge of the injustices comitted against palestinians we reject all al qaeda practices as these crimes are against humanity these crimes are all steered from washington by the cia and they only represent u s policy
4275148 the al qaeda terror organization has caused immense damage to islam to moslems worldwide and to the interests of the peoples of all arab and muslim countries
4275149 in fact the cia is using the terrorist actions of its proxy al qaeda in order to give the u

4275151 to see so many people from the 9 11 truth movement
4275152 i called them probably i guess about 4 or so times over the months just asking them to come out and take care of it
4275153 in an hour i got a response from the cable provider
4275154 the door bell rang and it was one of their technicians who had actually come to my house and this was all in the span of about an hour and a half from the initial twitter
4275155 this is the way you do business in the 21st century
4275156 you start trying to engage people about the good things that are happening with your products you can build that sort of viral good karma
4275157 i think when we first started participating we were a little hesitant
4275158 theyve said wow its nice to hear a company communicating like a normal human being i have never had any negative response
4275159 they went from being a company who i felt was a necessary evil to somebody who i was very excited to be working with
4275160 the arroyo administration is really asking for it it is courting mass protest actions on a nationwide scale the next month will be crucial in generating momentum versus charter change the filipino people will have to deliver an olympian effort in trying to defeat once and for all arroyos ambitions of staying in power
4275161 the anti charter change campaign will be done at the grassroots level in the communities parishes offices schools and factories charter change and term extension will be opposed every step of the way
4275162 we are consulting with other anti arroyo forces in mapping out the next steps in our efforts to stop arroyos cha cha once and for all cha cha is like a zombie its dead but if refuses to die
4275163 no matter how hard malaca ang tries to deny its ambitions of a term extension nobody is buying it this government suffers from zero credibility everyone is suspicious of the self serving interests of mrs arroyo
4275164 she lied before about not running in 2004 she lied again regarding election fraud nothing in her track record shows that she wont lie again regarding the 2010 elections
4275165 we ask ourselves what would we want to watch when we are at a movie theatre
4275166 thats it if it makes us laugh we consider it funny if it entertains us we consider it entertaining we dont want these movies to be stupid and when i go to a movie i like it to have some story and something i am emotionally invested in
4275167 but having said that i dont need it to be atonement for me to enjoy it ive never walked out of a movie and said man there was too much f ing action in that
4275168 we were developing a relationship with the studio and in any relationship theres a compromise as my girlfriend says
4275169 i mean when youre selling weed to 12 year olds in a movie youre doing something that a studio probably doesnt want you to do but they let you do it and making these movies at a reasonable budget is one of the things that lets us do that
4275170 this is a 26 million movie and its by far the cheapest of these big summer movies that theyre really sinking promotional dollars into so thats why were able to do so much because its not that big a risk for them its not like tropic thunder which cost 200 million
4275171 lots of toys i have a good time there its the only place where im the cool guy in the room
4275172 its a love story it isnt that risqu in my opinion and theres an appeals process going on but to me its hypocritical and ridiculous in pineapple express we sell drugs to 12 year olds and we kill dozens of people and nobody has a problem with it
4275173 if im not working for a week its no different from a week when i wasnt working two years ago except im not really worried about getting a job
4275174 people recognise me and come up to me sometimes but im not like george clooney im not one of the people thank god whose personal life is of any interest to the rest of the world so it hasnt really affected things as much as one might think
4275175 ive kissed so many asses in my time sometimes i dont recognise the celebrities until theyre bending over
4275176 you think is this my date from last night or did i just give birth
4275177 scan your own groceries its a plague that must be stopped well be stacking the shelves next
4275178 he was talking about leaving the film after a week
4275179 he was staying up late playing computer games his diet was burgers and coke he was playing up because he was tired so he didnt think he could do the film
4275180 he thought that if i drank purdeys it must be ok
4275181 ive got shane to thank and all the cast for sticking by me and just helping me completely
4275182 i cant stand my own voice so i wouldnt really notice anything about my performance because i dont tend to listen to myself
4275183 not in front of the film crew because i know theyre professional
4275184 im not bothered about stuff like running around with my trousers down i dont know whether youve heard of the term when you get kegged you pull someones trousers and boxers down to their ankles that happens a lot in grimsby
4275185 in between the happiness i was devastated because she was always in pain
4275186 she watched the rushes of this is england with shane and she started to cry
4275187 now weve got a litter bin at every bus stop
4275188 george you can type this shit but you sure cant say it
4275189 so should we forbid war reporting just to save the life of a dude who claims to have blue blood

4275625 generally the forces are starting to move out of the city particularly gori starting to consolidate their positions and get themselves into a position where they can start to back away towards the border we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori

4275627 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation is that clear enough
4275628 the air corridors are open for us to take the humanitarian supplies in
4275629 they appear to be withdrawing their forces back towards abkhazia and back and to the zone of conflict toward south ossetia
4275630 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4275631 well first of all i think we need to take this in sequences getting the russians back inside the zone of conflict and then back inside abkhazia and south ossetia it seems to me is the first objective
4275632 whether they russian forces stay there how long they stay there and so on is as best i can tell a subject that will be negotiated

4275644 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
4275645 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
4275646 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
4275647 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps

4275871 study shows federal judge copied aclu text in dover intelligent design ruling
4275872 copied verbatim or nearly verbatim 90 9 of his 6 004 word section in whether intelligent design is science from the aclus proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law submitted to him nearly a month before his ruling
4275873 seriously undercuts the credibility of a central part of the ruling
4275874 misconstruing intelligent design a critical analysis of the kitzmiller v dover decision
4275875 before you and your editorial board make any decision about whether to run the di article either in its present or a shortened form i would check to see how much of it has already been published in the traipsing book
4275876 i am troubled by the fact that dewolfs material is part of a previously published book dewolf hadnt mentioned that to me
4275877 how original is the misconstruing intelligent design article i received if the article is esentially similar to the traipsing book that will be an issue for the mlr to consider before we go any further can someone explain this to me and send me a copy of the book
4275878 i have compared the traipsing book with the article and they are about 95 percent identical a few word changes and lengthier footnotes in the article
4275879 our author agreement requires that the authors pledge that the submitted article has not been published elsewhere i told dewolf straight up weeks ago that we require original works
4275880 i dont think the di authors have been up front with you nowing that their article is 95 percent identical with traipsing that might explain why dewolf didnt tell you this at the outset and why you didnt get a copy of traipsing
4275881 disaster in dover the trials and tribulations of intelligent design
4275882 it seems to me the height of hypocrisy for the discovery institute to accuse judge jones of copying 90 percent of one section of his opinion just 16 percent of its total length from the proposed findings of fact by the plaintiffs lawyers when the di itself tried to palm off as original work a law review article that was copied 95 percent from the authors own book concealing this fact from the law review editors until i discovered and documented this effort seriously undercuts the credibility of the di on this or any other issue
4275883 our author agreement requires that the authors pledge that the submitted article has not been published elsewhere i told dewolf straight up weeks ago that we require original works
4275884 i dont think the di authors have been up front with you nowing that their article is 95 percent identical with traipsing that might explain why dewolf didnt tell you this at the outset and why you didnt get a copy of traipsing
4275885 the basic question would be whether or not the law review would be interested in publishing something that is a modestly revised version of the book
4275886 i mentioned that prof dewolf would be willing to submit an article to mlr putting in law review form material that earlier had been in a book directed at a different market he has sent to me a file with a rough draft attached do you want to see it
4275887 yes forward me the draft manuscript thanks for your efforts on behalf of the montana law review
4275888 i mentioned that prof dewolf would be willing to submit an article to mlr putting in law review form material that earlier had been in a book directed at a different market he has sent to me a file with a rough draft attached do you want to see it

4275891 our author agreement requires that the authors pledge that the submitted article has not been published elsewhere i told dewolf straight up weeks ago that we require original works

4275894 i am troubled by the fact that dewolfs material is part of a previously published book
4275895 in law review form material that earlier had been in a book directed at a different market
4275896 all of this demonstrates beyond doubt that professor dewolf was open and honest throughout the entire transaction

4275905 in the first half we had too many unforced errors and needed to play in their half and not get trapped in our half which is what happened
4275906 in the second half they put people behind the ball and played on the break which they did very well
4275907 we needed to be dynamic and more personality and drive the play fair play to the opposition though they understand the counter attack game and executed it well
4275908 we are short of a few players and are a bit light so were still in the market for players the match is only at half time
4275909 those two games in particular show there is very very little between all three teams in the tri nations
4275910 if you are not 100 per cent and get things dead right you will come second you just have to make sure you get your preparation right to play as well as you can

4275964 this program was implemented as a means to keep these kids busy and out of trouble as well as to give them a sense of citizenship and teach them about the importance of why they need to keep their environment clean

4276043 god called me to dedicate my life to young people to go among them and find them because today it is hard for young people to go to church so it has to be the church to go towards them this project was born to attract young people in the places where they normally hang out such as streets and beaches

4276058 o death where is thy victory o death where is thy sting
4276059 blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that you sucked
4276060 blessed rather are those who hear the word of god and keep it
4276061 a woman clothed with the sun with the moon beneath her feet
4276062 now have salvation and power come and the kingdom of our god and the authority of his anointed one
4276063 blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb and why is this granted me that the mother of my lord should come to me for behold when the voice of your greeting came to my ears the babe in my womb leaped for joy and blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfilment of what was spoken to her from the lord
4276064 my soul magnifies the lord and my spirit rejoices in god my savior for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden for behold henceforth all generations will call me blessed for he who is mighty has done great things for me and holy is his name and his mercy is on those who fear him from generation to generation he has shown strength with his arm he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts he has put down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of low degree he has filled the hungry with good things and the rich he has sent empty away he has helped his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy as he spoke to our fathers to abraham and to his posterity for ever
4276065 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4276066 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4276067 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4276068 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4276069 for christ took his immaculate flesh from the immaculate flesh of mary and if he had prepared a place in heaven for the apostles how much more for his mother if enoch had been translated and elijah had gone to heaven how much more mary who like the moon in the midst of the stars shines forth and excels among the prophets and apostles for even though her god bearing body tasted death it did not undergo corruption but was preserved incorrupt and undefiled and taken up into heaven with its pure and spotless soul
4276070 christ has risen from the dead we need no further assurance of our faith mary assumed into heaven serves rather as a gracious reminder to the church that our lord wishes all whom the father has given him to be raised with him in mary taken to glory to union with christ the church sees herself answering the invitation of the heavenly bridegroom
4276071 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4276072 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4276073 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4276074 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4276075 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4276076 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4276077 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4276078 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4276079 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4276080 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4276081 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4276082 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4276083 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4276084 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4276085 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4276086 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4276087 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4276088 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4276089 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4276090 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4276091 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4276092 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4276093 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4276094 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4276095 it was about a 25 page effort when we first got it handed to us and what weve done is refined it down to where its about an 8 page document now were hoping to get it down to a four page document just for simplicity of implementation so people can understand it
4276096 hij weet zo veel van milieu toch het belangrijkste onderwerp voor groenlinks
4276097 maar ik betreur het heel erg hij is altijd heel openhartig geweest over zijn verleden dat is uitzonderlijk voor zijn generatie ik hoop dat anderen hem zullen volgen
4276098 het is alsof ik nog in de jaren tachtig leef dat is het beeld waar ik me zo ongelukkig bij voel nu heb ik mijn handen vrij om volop in debat te gaan
4276099 mijn eerste milieuactie vlakbij het binnenhof was een inbraak in het ministerie van economische zaken in 1985

4276113 the antounians store bijou palace sold only costume jewelry and was not in the business of selling purses and wallets
4276114 ortiz alerted kris buckner president of investigative consultants and lead counsel janine garguilo for louis vuitton and christian dior of the errors in the investigation reports months before trial but legal action still proceeded against the antounians
4276115 these were the same items that the antounians and bijou palace were to have allegedly sold
4276116 we understand the plight of companies as they try to protect their brand from counterfeiters
4276117 but doing as they did in this case is unjustifiable maybe they wanted to send a message to would be counterfeiters that they mean business instead louis vuitton and christian dior succeeded only in destroying a small business
4276118 our record financial results continue to validate our business strategy and demonstrate the significant progress towards our goals
4276119 during this quarter we increased our sales and margins across all product segments in addition to increases in our formulation business and new product offerings despite the rising raw material prices our unit costs for 7 aca and clavulanic acid were further reduced and have been among the lowest level in the industry mainly due to our continuous improvements in the manufacturing technology improved cost structure and operational efficiency combined with synergistic benefits from the vertical production operations have led to five fold increases in net profit for the second straight quarter with enhanced competitive advantages we believe dragon pharma is well positioned for strong performance in 2008
4276120 please watch the following video then i will make my comments

4276124 his understanding and familiarity with the political history of european countries achieved by years of study and firsthand observation admirably qualify him for this responsible work
4276125 sometimes in spite of himself he finds himself involved in policy matters by superiors who wish to take advantage of his name
4276126 those are things were investigating right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4276127 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4276128 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4276129 you dont ever know about people but thats the last thing in the world i would have ever considered
4276130 he was not a person of a lot of words but he did carry on conversations

4276148 these landmark agreements signal the arrival of utility scale pv solar power that may be cost competitive with solar thermal and wind energy
4276149 its a pretty big jump in manufacturing capacity and a big opportunity for the pv industry particularly for thin film
4276150 if we were trying to do it this year it would be all of our production
4276151 sunpower is ramping very quickly by 2010 our production will be at least 650 megawatts
4276152 power prices are going up and public policy is requiring utilities to have a portfolio of renewables
4276153 and after building some 40 megawatts of power plants in spain sunpower has been able to improve its manufacturing processes and cut costs according to blunden
4276154 we could see where the cost reductions were coming down and the benefits of scal e
4276155 we saw there was a way for us to be competitive with other renewables
4276156 by taking control of the value chain from start to finish by being vertically integrated and cutting out the middleman
4276157 we can be competitive not only with other renewable energy but with conventional energy

4276164 either enter jordan without religious objects or go back to israel
4276165 they seemed to know exactly what they were looking for
4276166 it was very demeaning to have such a negative experience in what is billed as a friendly country people in the group including the tour guides were quite shocked no one had ever heard that jordan imposed religious restrictions
4276167 what made it worse was that the whole thing seemed to be directed solely at jews i saw christians walking through into jordan openly wearing crosses apparently christian religious symbols did not seem to be a problem for the jordanians i can well imagine the international outcry if islamic tourists were to encounter such restrictions on their entry into israel
4276168 the jordanian security authorities are responsible for the safety of all visitors to the kingdom and it is our duty to take all measures required in this regard
4276169 the vast majority of the group decided that as proud israelis we were either going to be allowed to walk into jordan holding our religious objects or we would not go in at all
4276170 the man who gets the most satisfactory results is not always the man with the most brilliant single mind but rather the man who can best coordinate the brains and talents of his associates

4276200 the militants believe that the shia officials are from the badr militia who are trained and strongly directed by iran with of course the knowledge of the americans
4276201 the militants now sahwa members kept blocking import of goods from iran
4276202 they shot the shopkeepers who dealt with them so it was rare to see iranian chocolate or anything else with the partial government control by the shia especially in the last six months shopkeepers are now allowed to deal in iranian goods
4276203 if the u s launches an assault on iran ill be the first volunteer to fight on the side of the u s
4276204 iran enjoys influence through the men of the united iraqi alliance in the baghdad government as represented by the supreme islamic iraqi council siic and the dawa party
4276205 the governor made a deal to import cooking oil from iran at a very high price that has never been seen before
4276206 i think the iranian influence will remain as long as there are such men as the governor raad rashid jawad in the province
4276207 the province was and still is the worst because of this corrupt administration
4276208 the iraqi government gives 5 million dollars per month to the iranian side to cover the cost of the electricity to diyala province
4276209 we dont have a representative government here or in baghdad because of the heavy iranian influence
4276210 that influence favours only those who support them and injures those of us who do not
4276211 the badr militia and all their political and religious leaders entered iraq on the backs of the american tanks
4276212 until the americans came there was no way they badr and iranian backed politicians and religious leaders could set one foot in this country
4276213 hi welcome to need decent name what can i get you this morning sir
4276214 were doing 33 evictions today in the 412 units out here a lot of these units are occupied by squatters and there have been neighborhood complaints management complaints about the activity thats going on in the vacant units were getting these people out so that management can come in and get good tenants back in these units and try to improve the quality of life of the other people around here
4276215 one woman said i cant go out on my porch at night because of whats going on across the street it was one of those vacant units where kids just come in and drink and whatever else
4276216 we came in knowing there are 70 people in park forest with warrants thirteen of them have addresses in this complex we didnt know coming in who we were going to encounter we made some arrests if we find squatters in these units theyre going to be charged with criminal trespassing
4276217 this is a great tool to be able to use in a situation like this
4276218 he mentioned he had been getting a lot of complaints that have built up over the course of the months about areas where people who have no reason to be in certain complexes and buildings are there and the amount of complaints hes been getting from the neighbors who belong there were just increasing
4276219 as opposed to coming out here on four different dates
4276220 chief fleming suggested it would be both more efficient for us but also for the community to understand that were very reactive and proactive
4276221 the response were getting from the people around here has been so positive
4276222 in a couple of these units theyve had some incidents with shootings so not knowing what were getting in to we brought the gang unit out as well
4276223 i think its good that theyre removing some of the bad element out of the area also some of the rent paying folk dont get the benefit of enjoying the environment out here
4276224 i think its a good job that theyre cleaning up the area around here finally
4276225 i think its a shame that they wait the weekend before school starts because a lot of these kids live in this area attend the school that i work at however at the same time too i think its a good idea to do what theyre doing so that we have a safe community to live in
4276226 the timing could have been better only for the sake of the kids
4276227 but i think its a good thing to sweep the community we all want to live in a safe environment from what i see right now its just unfortunate that the kids have to suffer but in order to keep the community clean certain measures have to be taken and i guess this is one of them
4276228 theres no good time to evict people the timing on this was we were responding to the neighbors complaints of the vacant units being used by anonymous people on the weekends for partying for drinking
4276229 we did it immediately every weekend that goes by we risk another shooting we risk another homicide so really thats why for the quality of life in the community
4276230 strange adults who seem to roam the courts being loud and disruptive using drugs and alcohol in public spaces
4276231 todays community policing objective is to respond to the neighborhoods demand to secure unoccupied units and remove former residents who have been lawfully evicted by the cook county circuit court
4276232 100 of the remaining residents are members of the park forest community who deserve to live in peace and raise their families in a safe neighborhood

4276242 hes one of the best bass players weve got in this business and to finally see him get recognition after standing behind for all these years is just wonderful
4276243 its always an honor to get nominated and its always a surprise too
4276244 you know theres a lot of young bands out there that are really entertaining the people these days id rather one of them would win it because theyre great but i still love talking to people on stage and we do requests from the audience all the time i figure they pay to get in to see you so you need to do what they want you to do
4276245 i do this out of a sense of participating in democracy
4276246 when the opportunity came up to take our electric guitars and make some unholy noise to try to stop a war it sounded familiar to me
4276247 its something we did 40 years ago as part of a generation that said the war in vietnam was wrong and needed to stop were part of a generation saying the war in iraq is wrong and needs to stop

4276252 the decision by corrections b c to make changes to their mother child program has no impact on the federal correctional systems mother child program
4276253 if she does everything right she will start out with day parole
4276254 this needs to be always first and foremost and no child should ever be inadvertently put at risk when a mother is incarcerated
4276255 by making these reforms the program will continue to ensure mother child relationships are fostered without endangering the safety of a child

4276260 apareci una figura portentosa en el cielo una mujer vestida de sol
4276261 cristo ha resucitado primicia de todos los que han muerto
4276262 para gloria de dios omnipotente y honor de su hijo para aumentar la gloria de su augusta madre y el gozo y la alegr a de toda la iglesia declaramos y definimos como dogma divinamente revelado que la inmaculada madre de dios siempre virgen mar a terminado el curso de su vida terrestre fue asunta a la gloria del cielo en cuerpo y alma

4276269 man is the only animal that blushes or needs to
4276270 we blush with embarrassment with shyness with uncertainty with a sense of exposure
4276271 blushing is a kind of glass bottomed boat enabling us to look at the depths upon which our ordinary moments float
4276272 there can be few experiences so all consuming as vomiting
4276273 a shouted reminder that we are embodied in an organism that has its own agenda
4276274 50 of people will yawn within five minutes of seeing someone else yawn
4276275 harrumphs are particularly associated with the idea of a member of the establishment whose overweight body provides the perfect instrument for manufacturing it
4276276 good idea to say hey script kiddies try this unless its already very public indeed
4276277 i dont think some spectacular security hole should be glorified or cared about as being any more

4276287 protecting our employees from malicious and unauthorized websites and blocking malware concealed in internet traffic before it can enter our network were key concerns for us
4276288 the webgate appliance from mi5 networks allows the ports authority to control web usage and neutralize malware with one high speed appliance that does not slow down web page response times its ability to detect machines that are controlled by a botnet gives my it team the added confidence of knowing that even if malware sneaks onto the network we can identify it block outgoing traffic and fix the machine before the problem can spread
4276289 if you dont buy all new stuff right now your kid will be picked on and bullied
4276290 moet je iemand zoeken die dat voor je wil n kan doen

4276296 we didnt get anything at all the system exploits the poor
4276297 why do you prefer the wilderness to the comforts of town
4276298 there is no comfort in a place where there is no truth
4276299 the air of the town is filled with falseness no one can safely breathe it
4276300 and unlike you i cant live on just the air
4276301 and ask at every shop my master would like a half anna of truth and a half anna of falsehood he who answers will feed you
4276302 tell your master that life is false and death is true
4276303 i want to give up the world and be a holy man
4276304 it is not by shirking our duty that we become saints
4276305 but by how we handle our responsibilities in our daily lives
4276306 then why is it that people leave their homes in search of god
4276307 there are those who actually seek the truth and there or those who only seek to escape their responsibilities
4276308 but the way i have come to show is to live in service to god in the daily world keeping his name on our lips and in our minds renunciation of outer things does not make for inner righteousness words are meaningless unless translated into action
4276309 this is the man who said that life is false and death is real but now he seems to hold to falseness so be it but who can escape death it comes to all no matter where they live
4276310 tis heel goed dat ie naar die school gaat maar kga het heel raar vinden om je byna nooit meer te sien

4276318 organisations of all sizes are understanding the benefits of hosted security services as the growth in the market continues to rise
4276319 the internet has become an indispensable part of todays working world and with an ever increasing level of threats that are spread through incoming internet traffic and instant messaging it is a natural progression for kaspersky lab to offer this functionality as part of its hosted services in the uk to address these areas
4276320 the picture revealed by this survey points to fundamental security issues with protecting not only a companys own data but also customer data like patient records or credit card numbers
4276321 with the blurring of boundaries between company employees and external consultants contractors outsourcers and other third parties it is now much more difficult to ensure the appropriate flow of information outside the organisation especially since the majority of employees are now knowledge workers with access to significant amounts of confidential data

4276330 like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
4276331 we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4276332 the good news for fans is that the gap will now be shortened between half blood prince and the first part of harry potter and the deathly hallows
4276333 perhaps we were a little bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse for tonight
4276334 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do
4276335 in the first half we had too many unforced errors and needed to play in their half and not get trapped in our half which is what happened
4276336 in the second half they put people behind the ball and played on the break which they did very well
4276337 we needed to be dynamic and more personality and drive the play fair play to the opposition though they understand the counter attack game and executed it well
4276338 we are short of a few players and are a bit light so were still in the market for players the match is only at half time
4276339 i could not think at all about the game on sunday until we had played tonight but i was very pleased with some of the football we played
4276340 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs

4276346 i think it should be possible to have this resolution before too long
4276347 there are some elements which we would like to see in the resolution
4276348 including lasting arrangements for abkhazia and south ossetia in six months time
4276349 we have never made any secret of the fact that we think that nato enlargement is wrong and that with every new wave of enlargement new security issues are created and there are better ways to deal with matters of regional european euro atlantic security
4276350 more cooperative ways which would include rather than exclude russia and which would take into account russian interests rather then look the other way
4276351 territorial integrity was one issue the other issue is any residual security arrangements that the russians would be able to maintain

4276357 we are so excited to finally get spore into the hands of fans and players the maxis studio has had an absolute blast creating spore but the fun is just beginning the most engaging stories are truly the ones people create themselves and we cant wait to see how players not only craft and explore the spore universe but hear what stories they have to tell as a result
4276358 we think the recovery will be shaped more like a nike swoosh with gradual improvement in 2009 and then steady progress into 2010 as our economic fundamentals regain solid footing
4276359 with costs rising energy shrinking and environmental concerns rising we have to respond quickly
4276360 we have to radically revamp our lineups create cleaner technology and work with others to develop new energy new fuelling stations and smarter roads
4276361 theres got to be an immense amount of change in the industry by the middle of the decade
4276362 we need to rollout more hybrids and continue to perfect ethanol clean diesel electric cars fuel cells and other alternatives

4276390 it is time to say goodbye to our long held dollar bearish stance for about 10 years we have been negative on the dollar occasionally wrong but mostly right
4276391 but now the valuation and growth driven improvements that we have been observing for a while have reached the point where they notably improve the medium to long term outlook for the dollar
4276392 powerful improvements in the real trade balance suggest the dollar has bottomed
4276393 the impact of valuation has become much clearer and more powerful increasing our confidence that strong underlying forces will lead to continued improvement in dollar fundamentals in the next couple of years
4276394 towards the end of that year dowdy rang me and said he was coming over to north harbour and asked if i fancied a spell in the npc
4276395 youve got the club rugby and then the npc and obviously super 14 after that so i had an idea that the npc was approaching the premiership level in england that sort of standard so i was hoping it would be perfect for me
4276396 i was really excited i had heard that the boys chuck the ball around a bit more than england generally the weather is probably a bit better although i havent seen it yet
4276397 i didnt play that much at bath probably about eight games so it was a good opportunity to come here and be starting games and hopefully i will get myself back on track and go from there
4276398 it was quite refreshing just to go out with guys who play because they just love the game and they are out there for a crack and having a beer after training and stuff like that it is quite fun
4276399 it was a really good standard of rugby we really took it to them expecting them to be one of the really top sides we were ahead for the whole game and were absolutely gutted to lose it in the end
4276400 it took me about four days to recover from last thursday night
4276401 its a funny league at the moment everyones all over the place
4276402 a torcida canta 90 minutos ser um prazer imenso estar dentro de campo e participar dessa festa
4276403 o corinthians um clube muito grande todo mundo fala do corinthians e quer jogar aqui a torcida canta 90 minutos ser um prazer imenso estar dentro de campo e participar dessa festa
4276404 a expectativa a melhor poss vel s tenho a agradecer as palavras do vice e passar para todos que estou muito feliz as coisas come aram muito bem
4276405 cheguei a um ponto no vasco onde n o dava mais para jogar quando o time ganhava todos ganhavam mas quando perdia era tudo em cima do morais cansei e isso acabou arranhando a minha imagem em rela o disciplina mas sou um cara muito tranq ilo e o pessoal pode ficar despreocupado
4276406 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4276407 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4276408 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4276409 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4276410 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4276411 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4276412 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4276413 were on track to get 100 000 australians visits into south africa for the year
4276414 theres been growing interest and we truly have a unique product
4276415 its great because our numbers are growing and interest in the destination is growing and we have people calling us from time to time asking why they cant get seats and that it is still slightly more expensive than it should be
4276416 theyll probably start by the end of next year hopefully november im sure by the holidays in december theyll have started
4276417 the various recommended activities in the book show the best side of tourism
4276418 all the activities recommended in the book help alleviate poverty but do so in a respectful and sustainable way that both the host and the visitor can be proud of
4276419 our aim now is to channel that growth more equitably towards sustainable and responsible tourism operators that help us conserve culture and at the same time fight poverty
4276420 china has almost spared no expense to welcome visitors to the games the message sent at the opening ceremony was loud and strong drawing attention to the countrys rich history and culture through the most innovative creative program that most of us have ever seen and that message went far and wide even reaching record levels of television audiences in the usa here in china their compatriots were also the biggest spenders on visa cards that same day
4276421 a safe and efficient payment system is important to the host country of the olympic games as visitors from all over the world expect to be able to make electronic payment as they do at home to this end visa is committed to help china develop a world class financial infrastructure and is working closely with the government tourism bodies and client financial institutions to build a robust electronic payment system in china
4276422 juros revenue analysis system puts lan in a position to recognize revenue opportunities at an early stage and react faster to market changes than our competitors
4276423 we are very pleased that lan airlines has chosen our marketing intelligence tool to enhance their revenue management capability
4276424 our aim is to upgrade our 16 domestic routes throughout the country by adding new aircraft with a capacity between 70 to 80 seats
4276425 such planes would allow passengers to fly in comfort and would also help the airlines to generate more income
4276426 theres only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving and thats your own self
4276427 over the past month singapore jet fuel is down 22 per cent and down 15 per cent in australian dollar terms with declines in the crude and refining margin both helping
4276428 for fy09 qantas and virgin are 75 85 per cent hedged at effective wti crude prices of us115 per barrel the current spot using mostly options therefore offering material upside as fuel drops
4276429 this should be supportive of our forecast of a 3 to 6 per cent rise in unit revenue yield and load but an uncertain domestic and international economic outlook makes this still difficult to predict
4276430 we wont change our numbers that much but i suspect a lot of other people will
4276431 the thing is the aussie dollar is offsetting a lot of it too the us crude price is coming down but the aussie dollars coming down thats what happened on the way up the aussie dollar insulated them and its doing the same on the way down but overall its still positive
4276432 tonta no ves que si les tratas bien no podr s someterles
4276433 up to the point of what occurred at the campground

4276435 heinous cruel and depraved are tough words in the english language but none of these words fully express the outrage of what you will see
4276436 have signed a joint business agreement on flights between europe and north america and plan to expand their global cooperation
4276437 embodies managements promise that if a flight generates revenue for amr corp an american airlines pilot must be at the flight controls
4276438 management therefore needs apas consent before this joint business agreement can go forward
4276439 make no mistake we want american airlines to succeed but that success cannot come at the expense of the employees
4276440 we have serious job security concerns that must be addressed as part of any revenue producing agreement with another airline
4276441 we have been anticipating this for some time we are already in discussions with the pilot association in spain we support these merger talks consolidation within the airline industry is inevitable and a merger of ba with iberia makes good sense
4276442 we trust the two companies will take their pilots fully into the process and consult with balpa and the spanish pilots association very closely indeed pilots have a lot to offer in the planning stages and want to be full partners in this enterprise
4276443 people consistently tell us that our tanks tales and tastings sessions are the best brewery tour theyve ever done
4276444 im sure its because they get such an up close encounter with the brewing equipment and get to spend an hour with one of the people who actually makes the beer
4276445 the additional paraburdoo services will result in an increase of 345 seats each week on this route and an additional 460 seats each week on the perth kalgoorlie route taking the number of weekly services between perth and kalgoorlie to 21 it will also result in an increase of 575 seats each week on our perth newman services
4276446 our fiji wedding was a truly magical and special day
4276447 its been a long and exciting journey from our origins as a himalayan trekking company three decades ago our 30th birthday functions will be our opportunity to say thank you to the industry for its support for peregrine throughout our history
4276448 over the years peregrine has grown and evolved adding new destinations so that with the introduction this year of australia and new zealand we now offer adventure holidays on all seven continents and were recognised as one of the worlds leading adventure travel operators
4276449 weve just completed another record growth year for both turnover and profit and were on track for a further 15 per cent growth this year bucking the perceived trend in economic downturn
4276450 rhondas work with the spc saw her playing a key creative and organisational role in major events like tahitis annual fifo film festival and the past three festivals of pacific arts in new caledonia in 2000 palau in 2004 and american samoa earlier this year
4276451 we strive to deliver authentic tahitian service and to be recognised for the quality and consistency of our service
4276452 to win these accolades once is a great honour and to win these awards for six years running is testimony to our commitment
4276453 but for an airline that celebrates its 10th anniversary later this year it is a great vote of confidence in our young team worldwide that we have managed not only to win these awards but to win them in six consecutive global assessments of the entire airline industry
4276454 we are delighted that our airline is also ranked as highly as our home
4276455 respect is not something that can be bought but has to be earned through hard work discipline and adherence to a firm set of principles
4276456 we would never dismiss a case because a motion was well taken

4276476 after an exchange of pleasantries the women confessed to us that they were not familiar with ed towns would work for anyone who would pay them and even offered tips to kevin and me regarding lit dropping and campaigning
4276477 inevitably we crossed paths several times with the two young women and observed them transposing the name of the current congressman when speaking to residents arguing over the amount of time wasted speaking to residents and talking about after work extracurricular activities that i hope the current congressman or any law abiding citizen would not endorse

4276483 now this story is no matter of mere opinion there is no possibility that obama just has a different opinion on a controversial national issue than we do as daniel patrick moynihan once famously said one is entitled to his own opinion but not his own facts what we have here is obama simply telling a lie and knowingly doing so will the old media continue to cover up for him like they have done for the last four years

4276487 it is disappointing after 5 messages you miss the point i networked and tried to get people interested in my work one person not my friend so all the advice you gave is non applicable you still charged me with spamming you blocked my page as a warning and said that if it happened again i would lose my account i have put in too much time for this to happen i already work hard often having to do capti puzzles to contact these potential friends and dont need the threat of someone placing a complaint on me and having my page denied this is unfair because i am a real person a father that is trying to feed my family i feel it is further unfair because more people are using myspace for their disgusting purposes while i use it for a noble and intended purpose also they feel like your site is only for them and their friends if they dont want any outside contact from others then they should use private emails and the telephone not a networking site i want to know what do i need to do to prove that i am a single person trying to feed my kids so that i never have to feel the threat of losing all my hard work simply because someone sometime may not want a product of mine dg

4276501 authority and holiness were regarded as adhering in the institutional church whether or not these moral and theological qualities were in evidence
4276502 by the doctrine of the visible church and its hierarchical structure
4276503 the apostolic mission is a reflection of gods own nature and character reflecting who god is from all eternity
4276504 one of the most pressing needs of theology to have the hypostatic union restated much more in terms of the mission of christ
4276505 in the existence of jesus christ it is a matter of the common actualisation of divine and human essence
4276506 we would do better to think of the hypostatic union in actualistic terms as a uniting rather than as a completed action a union
4276507 god chose translation as his mode of action for the salvation of humanity christian faith rests on a divine act of translation the word became flesh and dwelt among us incarnation is translation when god in christ became man divinity was translated into humanity as though humanity were a receptor language
4276508 no one speaks generalized language it is necessary to speak a particular language
4276509 became a person in a particular locality and in a particular ethnic group at a particular time and place
4276510 we are conditioned by a particular time and place by our family and group and society by culture in fact
4276511 no group of christians has therefore any right to impose in the name of christ upon another group of christians a set of assumptions about life determined by another time and place
4276512 whispers to the christian that he has no abiding city and warns him that to be faithful to christ will put him out of step with his society for that society never existed in east or west ancient time or modern which could absorb the word of christ painlessly into its system

4276530 we are saddled with the painful but important task of completing the implementation of the international court of justices judgment by handing the bakassi peninsula to cameroon
4276531 i dont think cameroon will be in a hurry to exploit bakassis oil reserves since the security situation remains a great concern
4276532 we were all right where we were until this whole problem started and now we are suffering
4276533 our struggle will continue until our demands are met whether it be from the nigerian government or cameroon

4276537 reasons why the act is better than nsw pint glasses
4276538 he was always into this primitive idea of eating ham off the bone and lots of sex and lots of rock n roll
4276539 the main thing is to make it roots y and be honest so its still got the emotional integrity and some kind of intensity undiluted and raw
4276540 its got quite a lot of releases now about forty releases its really taken off and all over europe its got a name for itself if people know youre on that label that alone will bring people to the gig
4276541 i guess you can say marriage took me to switzerland i think thats what gets a lot of people to travel loves always the motivation for most things
4276542 i remember to get on the dole and they said what do you want to do for a job and i said i want to be a musician and they were like i think thats just a dream they totally discouraged me from that and then i put down i wanted to be a cook instead and i did that for a while
4276543 my mum used to always say i had cloth ears when i was young because i was always eavesdropping and listening in on people
4276544 id just committed to a cooking job and just chucked it in and said im really sorry i cant do this i know i said i could and been here only six weeks
4276545 shit ive made my living for four years now from playing music and from playing music i want to play
4276546 it was basically living in a van a lot of the time
4276547 theres a lot of programmes in place for this sort of thing and a lot of institutions that will fund you to further what youre doing they see it as you taking your culture out into the world
4276548 switzerlands really fertile in a way a lot of europe is fertile culture is really encouraged its not a side project in france every town has its festivals every little town puts a lot of money into having music theatre switzerland too theres a lot of money put into it
4276549 because if you want to make good music you have to be really flexible and you also have to be able to live on a shoestring because often its not going to support it you have to be able to move house in half an hour you have to be able to carry everything you own with you
4276550 hes got a heart such a big heart you cant believe it
4276551 yeah bands will definitely suffer if you have a lot of them i guess now its really easy for people to have a lot of projects and i guess people will be like ill play for that band its good for a while and its good training as a musician but in the end you end up diluting and you have to make a decision what your priority is
4276552 i did put my main priorities with the dead brothers
4276553 one tooth ivan band was me learning to play the lap steel it was great because mainly what i was doing was playing the lap steel for them and singing as well and i played a bit of acoustic guitar too the alpine cretins that was really song writing and harmony work and that was nice for that and then the dead brothers that was just like training because we were so busy we were touring all the time we were recording and we were taking really big steps in a really short space of time it felt like a crash course in university in how to tour and how to sound check and how to get a good album put together that was really good i really benefited from that and i couldnt have done it if i had stayed in new zealand or australia having these european tours where youd go five weeks on the road playing most nights its really solid experience
4276554 i came back last summer and i really liked the feeling of being here and the fact that it was home and the fact that it was my language i think it was really a change for ages even if a lot of people speak english overseas and you can learn another language its not your mother tongue and you make jokes and people will look at you like youre a bit weird or something it can be strange to be in another country for so long and i felt like i was losing touch with new zealand if i do want to end up living here sometime later on id like to have some more connection to it and build something here
4276555 any kind of staying in one place is going to be a bit strange
4276556 i guess i do have those aspects but im not rocknroll so much a lot of it seems to be tied into this big retro comeback thing which i dont know when i see that i think im not interested in that you know 50s were ok and the 60s but thats where they are
4276557 teddy boy haircut a plaid shirt and some jeans and a muscle car that think thats what you have to do in order to be a rebel but theyre the most conformist people around theyve all got the same haircut they wear the same clothes theres no rebellion at all its just brainless trend following
4276558 different colours in the music im also a sucker for vocal harmonies
4276559 theres new bands coming up who are somehow really mature for being a new band i just like the way they think its really really nice to see good thinking going into music and not just following blindly along the tracks of lets make a band and this is how the songs have to be
4276560 pretty heavy role it was amazing it was really intense work it was great

4276575 quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively

4276584 if ideological confrontation is unavoidable the nation should focus on its future aspect not the past one the only way korea can secure space between its two giant neighbors is to not stick to petty nationalism but instead to grow up as real global citizens who put logic ahead of emotion as well as the rule of law ahead of the rule by men its also time to replace the nouveau niche like slogans of advanced
4276585 until the founding of the republic 60 years ago we never had the concept that sovereignty resides with the people
4276586 our nation freeing itself from the subjection of a feudalistic tribe was reborn as a people in modern perception nourishing social capabilities determining its own fate and making decisions as sovereign subjects

4276605 during a photo session where the spanish national team was unveiled one of our sponsors asked us to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing and we made an oriental expression with our eyes
4276606 it seemed to us to be something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
4276607 i want to express that we have great respect for the orient and its people some of my best friends in toronto are of chinese origin
4276608 even though the chinese community has a long history of settlement in spain the spanish population still considers the chinese as a closed and somewhat mysterious community references to exaggerated stereotypes and prejudices regarding their activities and social organization can often be overheard in daily conversations
4276609 in fact i was working at the metropolitan museum of art and i was accosted a couple of times by a couple of women who were just really irate and angry they asked how could you do a role like that but its funny too because at the same time i laugh at the character its an odd animal
4276610 many michigan families are struggling as a result of the failed policies and old politics that john mccain wants to continue the focus of our convention to people back here in michigan should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not a distraction involving the troubles of one individual

4276658 due to their inability to operate only 280 000 people of the 1 5 million in need of food assistance are being reached with distributions
4276659 this ban must be lifted immediately so that aid organizations can carry out their relief work and avert a catastrophic humanitarian crisis
4276660 i call on the government of zimbabwe to fully respect humanitarian principles and the impartiality and neutrality of voluntary and non governmental organizations allowing them to operate freely and with unrestricted access to those in need
4276661 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4276662 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4276663 come out stronger if people believe that their voices were heard
4276664 that is a very big part of how we come out unified people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and everybody get behind senator obama

4276673 and this is going to be my senior year so just trying to save up some money and have some money to spend over there and maybe keep for college
4276674 its very positive good news for mack trucks and the community
4276675 maybe up to 10 or 15 percent of those folks may come down from allentown which is always good for the local economy relative to home purchase
4276676 and then theyll be providing job opportunities for young professionals that are here so its a wonderful blend the best of both worlds
4276677 weve built momentum starting with fedex express at the airport fedex ground is now looking and we hope to hear from them anytime
4276678 honda aircraft company dell computer lenovo computer so weve had several major companies elect to move to greensboro
4276679 you know you are competing with other states that are doing it
4276680 so you have to be competitive to attract business and industry
4276681 yea they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils and shed innocent blood even the blood of their sons and of their daughters whom they sacrificed unto the idols of canaan and the land was polluted with blood thus were they defiled with their own works and went a whoring with their own inventions
4276682 comes as close to infanticide as anything i have seen in our judiciary
4276683 of course we believe everyone should deserve the protection of this bill who could be more vulnerable than a newborn baby so of course we agree with that we join with an aye vote on this i hope it will in fact be unanimous
4276684 in which he voted for any regulation or restriction on the practice of abortion
4276685 for the love of money is the root of all evi
4276686 the number of properties that have been foreclosed on by the banks and still havent sold is the highest weve ever seen
4276687 likely delay the inevitable that most of those properties go into foreclosure

4276689 confiamos en que esta reapertura permitir el esclarecimiento definitivo de este crimen aberrante
4276690 i think quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
4276691 this is the prime minister who made a virtue of passing fixed election date legislation and now hes threatening to cross sussex drive and go see his neighbour the governor general and ask for an election because hes fabricating a crisis where none exists
4276692 a major part of whatever is dysfunctional is coming from the government side he is choosing to cover over that which is another reason why people dont trust mr harper
4276693 we are going to make sure that atlantic canadians are not tricked into voting for a carbon tax that would damage the region
4276694 it would hurt families here it would hurt industries here
4276695 he told me to leave his apartment and that somebody had slandered him i left called the police and told them what was happening
4276696 our women do not participate in the labor force at the desired level we will provide them with education to open paths for them into the labor market the micro credit system is a way in which we used to provide this
4276697 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4276698 regional peace and welfare must be secured via cooperative projects that reflect common sense and mutual interests not sentimentalism clashes and tensions
4276699 the peace and welfare of georgia with which turkey has close historical and cultural links is a matter of great concern for turkey
4276700 this is not the time to do business with iran it is time for the international community including our ally turkey to begin considering additional measures to pressure iran
4276701 there will be no change in the will of the iranian people
4276702 western countries should not support them israel so much the life of this regime has come to an end
4276703 yea they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils and shed innocent blood even the blood of their sons and of their daughters whom they sacrificed unto the idols of canaan and the land was polluted with blood thus were they defiled with their own works and went a whoring with their own inventions
4276704 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4276705 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4276706 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement
4276707 and i think ridge is a great example of that
4276708 that lowers the prospects that tim kaine is likely to be the choice
4276709 unlikely to have two keynotes speakers from virginia in two days
4276710 one other note when barack obama was with bayh in indiana his campaign team was out there taking footage another clue that could be working for bayh
4276711 clues they could be the wild card choices here for barack obama
4276712 the only viable solution is to license lap dancing clubs as sex encounter establishments
4276713 this would untie the hands of local authorities and enable them to fulfil their duties under the gender equality duty alongside local authorities across the country we urge the government to enact reform and give local communities a voice
4276714 most of us agree that there are areas in cities where perhaps adult entertainment is suitable but there are areas where it certainly is not
4276715 investigate any information that is passed to us and ensure it is accurate before responding in a proportionate and measured way
4276716 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned
4276717 however these types of enquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve
4276718 i would ask local residents to be patient with us and to be assured that we will keep them updated in relation to the investigation as and when we can
4276719 households who are concerned about their jobs their homes and their ongoing ability to pay their bills will be left with no choice but to cut back on both heating and eating this winter
4276720 soaring wholesale gas prices have made their impact on suppliers profits and ultimately on consumer bills the government needs to provide a strategy and regulatory environment to ensure that the lights stay on at an affordable price
4276721 is the sex of a candidate important for you in employing him her
4276722 is the sexual preference of an employee a criterion for you
4276723 despite the continuous inspections by our ministry and the sanctions we have imposed such fatal accidents have not stopped occurring at the tuzla shipyards
4276724 calling the incidents mere work accidents would be very unfair to the dead workers and their families such incidents are unacceptable those who are responsible for these events will be found out and they will be punished
4276725 we as the ministry exercise all the authority that we possess by law at the tuzla shipyards yet the problems continue
4276726 it is time for syrian tutelage to end once and for all
4276727 we have long stood for the normalization of relations between syria and lebanon on the basis of equality and respect for lebanese sovereignty one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4276728 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
4276729 there are no legal obstacles to bringing karata s corpse back and we have not appealed to any judicial institutions or bureaucrats on this issue
4276730 if tomorrow president mikhail saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start
4276731 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4276732 this is a member state of the united nations and its internationally recognized borders need to be respected
4276733 it is time for this crisis to be over the provisional cease fire must go into place
4276734 the provisional cease fire that was agreed to really must go into place
4276735 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration
4276736 we will use us aircraft as well as naval forces
4276737 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4276738 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4276739 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4276740 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for this cease fire
4276741 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4276742 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4276743 they introduced themselves and at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times
4276744 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend
4276745 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly
4276746 our trial was not powered on a difference in clinical outcome between the two groups however we noted a better clinical outcome in the tirofiban group than in the placebo group with lower overall mortality and less urgent repeat pci
4276747 russia lost because it infuriated the whole world and seems to be going back to its old methods europe has shown some hectic action and an inability to be organized and the united states was proven helpless and inefficient
4276748 for seven countries to come together without an eighth country that has happened over the last few days
4276749 i think that makes very clear to russia that there are political consequences
4276750 the events in georgia over the last 5 days have shocked me people throughout the uk and the international community
4276751 russias use of force in a sovereign and democratic country is unacceptable and unjustifiable
4276752 i think that the russia government is taking advantage of the fact that the us soft power is in decline and that the eu has a very elastic conception of sovereignty
4276753 im worried we might be in a rock paper scissors situation and that they the russians are definitely on the rock side i think they are betting that rock trumps paper
4276754 the hospital will also serve as a training facility for congolese doctors we are planning to employ congolese doctors and medical staff also
4276755 the allies considered it was not appropriate at this time to approve the deployment of that ship
4276756 rumors that musharraf is set to quit have been circulating in pakistan for several days he has suffered a collapse in support as three of pakistans four provincial parliaments have passed resolutions with overwhelming backing declaring him unfit for office the fourth province is expected to follow soon
4276757 this turkey has long been the favored destination for musharraf in exile he spent his childhood in turkey speaks the language and loves the country he is rumored to own property there but turkey is a muslim majority country and he may become a target
4276758 were being told by western envoys that its not going to bring more stability to have a long trial and that it is in the interests of stability for him to exit
4276759 here is the real emphasis of the petition we encountered two similar incidents earlier
4276760 both of these incidents were covered up turkey should not miss this opportunity again we should go to the end wherever that end might reach this shouldnt be like the other cases
4276761 the alleged crimes and the state mentality that is the cause of them should be exposed
4276762 this is not something the prosecutor can do by himself
4276763 it was a petition for a narrow circle of people but now it is being opened to the public due to demand after known public figures signed it
4276764 the justice and development party ak party cannot reap the benefits
4276765 half of them should be fried and the other half should be grilled
4276766 i am worried that the ak party might have agreed on a secret deal with the military to not expose those ergenekon members who are in the military
4276767 of course i dont approve of dismissals but i would like to see some transparency if they are going to happen it was curious that they didnt have any this year
4276768 this signature for me sends the message to them that we are watching
4276769 i would like to see zden rnek among the defendants there are also officials who were involved in the susurluk affair who have been left out as well
4276770 the indictment claims that the investigation can go back to the events of may 1 1977 when many people were killed at a labor day demonstration in stanbuls taksim square if it hints at that it should go after this fact and bring it before the judiciary

4276777 ive got to convince the player this is the place for him to come and play his football
4276778 justin hoyte has got fantastic potential hes already a very good player and weve done research we know hes a good professional in terms of his lifestyle
4276779 ive spoken to his agent and hes said coming up to the north east is not an issue
4276780 andy johnson will not be able to feature because he had a thigh strain when he came to the club and we dont want to take the risk with that
4276781 although im pretty sure he will be able to play against arsenal the following week
4276782 when we started our negotiations he had taken part in a shooting practice at everton just before they left for america and got a strain in his left thigh we started to treat him as soon as we could which was four or five days after the incident but that unfortunately has cost us a week
4276783 its no good trying to kid people michael is back in training but i think manchester united will come a bit early
4276784 he just needs a week with the group and were not going to get that before sunday so hes very very doubtful for manchester united
4276785 that will definitely help us in the area of ela
4276786 were again just looking at ways to keep students engaged in school
4276787 new york state is committed to helping provide outdoor enthusiasts with numerous recreational opportunities to enjoy the beauty of our state throughout the year

4276789 the voters must make their individual study and believe of which candidate best can represent their interests and those of their communities
4276790 id be happy to debate just like i was during my last election and elections before that
4276791 i just think its regrettable that rather than picking up the phone to call me hes made it a political issue through the press
4276792 these patriots believed that the greater number of forums would give the public its best chance to judge the candidates strengths character ability and commitment
4276793 i do this out of a sense of participating in democracy
4276794 when the opportunity came up to take our electric guitars and make some unholy noise to try to stop a war it sounded familiar to me
4276795 its something we did 40 years ago as part of a generation that said the war in vietnam was wrong and needed to stop were part of a generation saying the
4276796 last year at the telethon of 07 he presented me with this gorgeous gift he presented it to me in the telethon office in 07 i put it in that traveling case and i hadnt traveled since that telethon til that day
4276797 it wouldnt be a weapon and we couldnt cite him for carrying a weapon
4276798 actor was cited july 25 for carrying the unloaded concealed weapon at the las vegas airport phone messages left for marghilano were not immediately returned thursday jerry lewis
4276799 she told the people she was capable of being the governor but she told the court she couldnt take care of herself
4276800 if someone cant establish and support themselves in three years that person doesnt deserve to be called an adult
4276801 if they do have the ability they wont receive alimony if the job is done right
4276802 if a woman is versatile and productive and ends up with a bum she can be required to pay alimony
4276803 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
4276804 i think curbishley has been the victim of a board thats come in and wanted success immediately and given him a lot of money
4276805 we will be criticised by pundits who played in very successful football teams but theyve never fought a relegation battle and they never knew what was needed to be achieved to stay up
4276806 i always felt that united would do it last year
4276807 but i fancy chelsea this time theres no african cup of nations in january theyve got a new manager theyve bought one or two players and for all the ups and downs last year they still nearly nicked it
4276808 if united get a top striker in then theyve got a chance
4276809 but my gut feeling this year would still be chelsea
4276810 robbie and fernando torres will be a real handful playing together
4276811 i think liverpool will go close this season and im sure theyd like to think theyd go closer than the last few years theyll be looking to win the league title this year and robbie and torres are the sort of players that win you football matches and ultimately win you trophies as well but there are good strikers at other clubs too like wayne rooney and carlos tevez and nicolas anelka and didier drogba
4276812 thats why theyre trying to bring in gareth barry a really good player who knows the premier league inside out
4276813 i cant speak highly enough of liverpool a great club with a great manager and a great history theyll be looking at the game against us and thinking its a decent start for them but with the quality weve got now particularly going forward we hope we can cause them a few problems theyll have a few players making their debuts too so it might be a good time to catch them
4276814 it was a bad performance we tried to do our best and it was not good enough fortunately we are still in the tie but we have to show better form than we showed in li ge now we are looking forward to the first game at sunderland to show who we are and what we are
4276815 more than one in ten mobile phone users have accessed the internet on their mobile phone
4276816 used a data card usb modem or dongle to access the internet in march 2008
4276817 yeah i tell him i love you all the time i tell him allll the time he probably doesnt know what to make of it some woman loves his dad how the hell could that happen
4276818 yeah maybe or maybe he thinks youre the crazy one
4276819 oh well at least were colorful thats got to be something
4276820 a soldier will bitch about pussy if you put it in fr
4276821 had an option to make the deal permanent at any stage so i spoke to him and asked him if he would be happy to stay he has been at the club for four or five weeks now and he said he would so he now becomes our record signing
4276822 we wish marlon all the best he is a good pro and he made a contribution last season he has worked hard in pre season and has made an impact but he has chosen to move on for the time being
4276823 i am very happy with the squad that ive got at my disposal and i feel we can challenge anyone at the moment and have the most successful campaign possible
4276824 portsmouth football club strongly deny charges by the fa alleging a breach of their regulations concerning the transfer of benjani mwaruwari to and from the club
4276825 we did not pay an agent when benjani joined the club from auxerre in january 2006 and his transfer to manchester city in january this year was approved at the time by the premier league and the fas compliance unit this is nothing more than a technicality which we will strongly contest
4276826 everyone was happy but here are people spending time trying to find something wrong they have dug up a regulation
4276827 we will continue to forge ahead as we are determined to show our loyal shareholders and the entire business world that this company will not only survive through the difficult times but in the end it will flourish
4276828 regardless of what many will say we still believe after all this time that our shareholders are our biggest strength
4276829 having been a shareholder of cmkm diamonds since march 2004 i am pleased to step forward and join the fight to reclaim what is ours this company has faced many obstacles since mr west has taken over yet he and our corporate counsel bill frizzell have met every challenge with courage dedication and veracity together we will work to return legitimacy to this company by building upon the foundation laid by their efforts i am honored to serve the shareholders of cmkm in building a viable profitable business
4276830 our role as a team is to effectively represent and promote the interests of all shareholders with a view to adding long term value to the companys shares we are all committed and prepared to make any personal sacrifices to ensure that we fulfill that role we intend to fulfill our goals by any and all means necessary and with honesty and integrity

4276834 in order to beat obama supporters we need to cut their welfare checks
4276835 identify partners with higher levels of service commitment for referral business and shoretel outsourcing opportunities
4276836 shoretel continues to selectively grow its partner population based primarily on market opportunity in a given geography and our current coverage in those areas
4276837 the champion partner program reinforces our commitment to our channel partners to enable them to receive benefits commensurate with their investment and loyalty to shoretel
4276838 in turn growing a stable of qualified partners allows us to manage our distribution strategy and focus partner recruitment in underserved markets helping minimize channel conflict and protect incumbent partner investments
4276839 for the world is hollow and i have touched the sky
4276840 the meaning of our existence is not invented by ourselves but rather detected
4276841 the real key to contentment and satisfaction is finding a purpose in life
4276842 the movement encourages positive world change from the inside out rather than from the outside in in my experience thats the only lasting route to positive global change
4276843 that scientific studies are showing the personal benefits of finding ones life purpose should be all the impetus needed to encourage millions of people to commit to finding their lives purpose
4276844 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later
4276845 it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict

4276864 i know our show isnt exactly frontline but we definitely tried to weed as much comedy into the situation as possible because these men and women let me know very quickly that when youre dealing with these kinds of injuries you just gotta laugh
4276865 what im proud of with this show is that it shows how people use humor to cope with a traumatic situation
4276866 you always need a couple of ticked off chaplains combined with some laughing soldiers and a couple er nurses
4276867 what really got me involved was when a friend of mine kerri turner from the television series
4276868 she told me that the trip would change my life and she was right it did
4276869 my goal this year with the walter reed episode is to have these men and women seen for the heroes they are and their families for the human beings they are
4276870 this experience shows us what happens to these brave men and women when they come home and deal with the injuries they have sustained while at war i saw the bravery from the moment i walked into fisher house to the rehab facility to the little show i put on that night
4276871 at this point i have basically put the army through hell i believe they call my crew the insurgency but i wont stop
4276872 i visit with returning soldiers before each show i do on the road i am so happy to be involved with performing for the armed forces and meeting them whatever i can do

4276879 the driver has a seatbelt safety glass to protect them as they drive but occupants do not i think they should have the same protection
4276880 i think it would be nice to have seatbelts in them but someone has to take responsibility for making people wear the seatbelts i cant do that
4276881 we should never jeopardize or take a chance on hurting someone for the profit
4276882 miss baynes pictures must have reached merton on saturday but owing to various things i did not see them till yesterday i merely write to say that i am pleased with them beyond even the expect more

4276919 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
4276920 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
4276921 two sources say apple will likely issue a software update by the end of september if not by the end of this month to resolve the issues

4276926 they took it from wachovia how they did it i dont know cause i did not sign any papers
4276927 they said we sent it back if you want your mommas money you get it back

4276931 we searched the entire neighborhood for weeks and couldnt find him
4276932 a lot of times we spent sleepless nights wondering where he was at hes just a friend
4276933 under normal circumstances we scan animals for microchips while were giving shots this one had a microchip
4276934 todd had been gone for so long i didnt think we were going to see him again
4276935 they brought him out there and he came running to us excited and i bent down and i hugged him and i had tears in my eyes
4276936 oh they were crying there wasnt a dry eye in the entire kennel
4276937 well it was just good to get him home we missed him
4276938 you should come to our church because we have canvassed the neighborhood and the polls show that our target demographic between the ages of 25 35 like a b and c we now have implemented a b and c so youll like it here
4276939 but heres the secret its possible to niche market and mass sell ipod commercials dont feature dancing 50 year olds they feature hip and fit 20 30 somethings but everyone and his grandmother wants to feel youthful and hip so they strap on nanos and call themselves apple converts who you portray in your marketing isnt necessarily the only demographic who buys your product its often the demographic that most people want to identify with or belong to the target isnt the market no one aspires to be the bland average so dont water down messaging to appeal to everyone it will end up appealing to no one

4276948 indeed fair sharon but i sense a mysterious darkness at the heart of this seemingly perfect idyll
4276949 it is quite a plain comment that voa does not care if there is internet censorship in china it only cares its own interests
4276950 what we may be witnessing is not just the end of the cold war or the passing of a particular period of post war history but the end of history as such that is the end point of mankinds ideological evolution and the universalisation of western liberal democracy as the final form of human government
4276951 there are three types of stress that impact how our bodies perform psychological stress is commonly enhanced by money problems struggling relationships or issues at work our ability to deal with those problems has a positive impact on our bodies physical stress is remedied by how we care for our bodies through exercise etc the children described in the study battled bio chemical stress fueled by what they put into their bodies the food and medicines we intake directly affect how we function

4276985 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4276986 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4276987 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4276988 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4276989 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4276990 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4276991 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4276992 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4276993 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4276994 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4276995 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4276996 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4276997 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4276998 this was very serious the investigations will go on for some time
4276999 i believe shes become a terrible embarrassment to them but shes not a terrorist
4277000 when the truth comes out people will see she did nothing wrong
4277001 im shocked that this is the same girl i knew
4277002 talking to the party gottlieb hadnt been feeling that well and they came back to the hut yesterday and probably sounds like within about 30 minutes of arriving at the hut he collapsed
4277003 they did an incredible job of trying to resuscitate him they worked on him for over two hours theyre a party of four or five and they did a huge job as a team of trying to bring him back around
4277004 after two hours they were advised that there was really no point continuing with their efforts
4277005 shes a remarkable woman very collected upset to have lost a friend like gottleib but yeah a remarkable woman
4277006 there was a desire on both sides to find a conclusion to this issue
4277007 this agreement signed today is designed to resolve the last major historical issue that has stood in the way of a more normal relationship between our two countries
4277008 under this agreement each countrys citizens can receive fair compensation for past incidents when fulfilled the agreement will permit libya and the us to develop their relations
4277009 i think that our system is trying to treat everybody under a particular brand and it doesnt work
4277010 and because of that were creating housing problems were creating employment problems were creating community problems and its needless and its not warranted
4277011 i understand how everybody deserves a second chance and all but im not willing to risk my children and my neighbors to find out if theyre rehabilitated or not
4277012 my evolution in this whole process if its meant to create positive change then great im all for that
4277013 its what i call a tough policy thats not smart
4277014 the prime minister never offered to absorb 20 000 refugees in israel the prime minister again reiterates that under any future agreement there will not be any return of palestinian refugees to israel in any number
4277015 i advocate federalism as a way to gain lasting peace in mindanao
4277016 this concentration of such enormous powers in manila has created only one center of finance and development in the country resulting in a highly centralized system of government
4277017 is the absence or utter lack of consultation of stakeholders including christian leaders indigenous peoples in mindanao and peace advocates themselves
4277018 contravenes the very essence of any peace process which is participative of the stakeholders
4277019 i think that our system is trying to treat everybody under a particular brand and it doesnt work
4277020 and because of that were creating housing problems were creating employment problems were creating community problems and its needless and its not warranted
4277021 i understand how everybody deserves a second chance and all but im not willing to risk my children and my neighbors to find out if theyre rehabilitated or not
4277022 my evolution in this whole process if its meant to create positive change then great im all for that
4277023 its what i call a tough policy thats not smart
4277024 for i will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sin no more

4277027 such a database helps the tsa spot patterns of activity that may indicate terrorist planning and refer people to the fbi for possible questioning
4277028 its just like if a police officer chats to somebody its part of the investigative process
4277029 we allow the refugees to stay in any unused building they can find
4277030 we take seriously any threats to extort money from anyone
4277031 they remain subject of both domestic or local and internal sanctions and investigations
4277032 because they are active members and contributing to the support network for karadzic
4277033 they are part of a network that has been the subject of ongoing criminal investigations for many years
4277034 with their bank accounts ordered frozen five years ago how is it that theyve come to live with no visible means of support all this time
4277035 they have multiple properties they take vacations in montenegro they travel to belgrade how no money no jobs they dont pay income tax they have cash in their house they cant explain how it gets there
4277036 karadzic as has been proven to be the case and mladic remain within the reach of serbian authorities and always have been
4277037 mladic is probably the hardest target there is and i think bringing him to justice will be very difficult it could take a week it could take a month it could take a year

4277040 we are coming apart at the seams in every sense
4277041 nearly two months to have a pair of trousers mended which had been torn by a not completely screwed down screw on a jump seat meanwhile alitalia is back in the news with plans of new cuts they want to make but i have already made my cuts

4277043 there is a meal missing either it wasnt loaded or there are more passengers than we had booked
4277044 the undercarriage is nude without mudguards the plane can only fly if it doesnt rain we are fine until the end of september but only in the south nothing to put security at risk
4277045 if one is not in line with the norms and dictates alitalia does not take off
4277046 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world
4277047 perhaps aviator az does not take into account the delicate situation in which we find ourselves
4277048 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4277049 when bush made his speech promising humanitarian aid everybody started whooping cheering high fiving

4277055 if even more people are encouraged to come to the island whats going to happen a certain kind of quality of life will disappear the issue is often portrayed as the rich islanders trying to keep the less rich at bay in france we are fated to be stuck for ever in 1789 but not everyone who lives in r is rich
4277056 any fair solution should involve the islanders paying something to use the bridge as well
4277057 otherwise it will be too easy to portray us as simply rich and selfish
4277058 the money must be used to create a proper system of public transport so visitors will be able to leave their cars on the other side of the bridge

4277074 i remember my first look at the great treatise of maxwells when i was a young man i saw that it was great greater and greatest with prodigious possibilities in its power i was determined to master the book and set to work i was very ignorant i had no knowledge of mathematical analysis having learned only school algebra and trigonometry which i had largely forgotten and thus my work was laid out for me it took me several years before i could understand as much as i possibly could then i set maxwell aside and followed my own course and i progressed much more quickly it will be understood that i preach the gospel according to my interpretation of maxwell

4277089 i want to make sure that if and when we do it its really good its perfect
4277090 itll be very limited i want to make sure and im not quite certain yet but we should have answers very shortly
4277091 weve spent a lot of time doing a lot of wiring of ballparks doing a lot of checking
4277092 every game i watch theres a bat splintered im sensitive about it and we need to move ahead
4277093 i thought we had forever solved the problem and we had everything we did worked but we may put an additional safeguard in
4277094 since i was 17 years old i have been performing on the opry circuit in texas
4277095 to be acknowledged by the grand ole opry and asked to perform is such an honor
4277096 this is more than i could have ever hoped for
4277097 weve got our eyes on the prize of getting to the top spot and thats what we want to do we want to run for the championship and contend for it i think we can do that
4277098 weve got to start plugging away and get 15 20 points a race to have a shot at clint in the final 10 races
4277099 were going to have to dig hard i think weve been running well enough on the mile and a half tracks to certainly gain some ground there we need to execute on those tracks and improve our short track program to make it happen
4277100 i was reading something the other day about alan kulwicki when he won his cup championship in 1992 he wrecked out at dover with six races to go and he was about 280 points behind and came back to win the championship
4277101 so being only 128 behind clint is not the end of the world we need to race to win and if we can win some races we can close that gap really quickly
4277102 michigan hasnt been one of my best tracks but i think weve got a lot better of a car now than we did when we raced there last year
4277103 weve given up some points over the last few weeks so we need to get back to business and work on padding our points lead
4277104 typically on a big track like michigan or atlanta where you can move around and carry a lot of speed we usually run well
4277105 i like tracks like michigan where you can mix it up and pass on the top or the bottom and try different things but for some reason we havent been able to find the right balance or the right level of grip to run well
4277106 michigan is a track where you never know exactly what youre going to get with it it seems like whenever you work on handling then you need power and need to take drag out of your car
4277107 youre never sure exactly how that race is going to play out which makes it challenging its a drivers racetrack because you can move around on it its nice and wide in the nationwide car its a really big drafting track with the tapered spacer package weve got well really draft well there youll probably see speeds pick up in the race maybe even over qualifying
4277108 michigan is important to me i remember being really young and watching my dad win an arca race there in 1992 and thinking about how cool that was
4277109 now im starting to get to the point where im starting to get some recognition from my friends and family for what i do and itd be really cool to get a win in front of them
4277110 yall come on over here and check this out i promise we wont bite
4277111 alright boys the race team is yours good luck im headed to the golf course
4277112 hes starting to understand how important every detail of playing the position is when you are asked to run the show to make all the checks and make all the decisions you really have to be technique sound and focus snap after snap after snap
4277113 im interested in carp fishing i live on a lake in central arkansas in which i have caught two grass carp around 40 to 50 pounds i would appreciate any info on baits and where to fish for these carp
4277114 fifty pounds of cracked corn cost next to nothing at a feed store
4277115 fill a quart milk jug with cracked corn and add water a few days before fishing
4277116 many lakes that need grass carp taken out are privately owned
4277117 often the owners will be delighted to get rid of the fish but be sure to get permission first

4277119 stretch it tightly over the doughball and tie up the ends with green thread to make a ball roll the ball in green food coloring
4277120 ebay might want to rethink their algorithm as i dont think they want to be known as a provider of great deals on women
4277121 acquiring mo strengthens our nucleus of players for both the short and long term he is entering his prime nba years and will be part of the foundation of our future success
4277122 his ability to push the tempo get inside the lane shoot from the perimeter and distribute the ball will be very valuable for us
4277123 all these guys are very excited they respect mo as a player and theyre looking forward to playing with him
4277124 i think this is a move to be able to get a talented young 25 year old point guard that can be part of the future
4277125 i think there was so much pressure on lebron to create so much of the offense in cleveland
4277126 i think somebody like mo is going to really make the game easier for lebron and create opportunities for other people
4277127 hes been to oklahoma city hes familiar with the people there hes familiar with the ford center hes played there the fans loved him when he was there his nickname is the cowboy its really apropos to come back
4277128 we understand that its a unique opportunity here specifically but weve got to do the best thing for our basketball team and we feel like the best thing for our basketball team is to add some toughness and some intangibles defensively for us at that position
4277129 his most productive days in the nba were just a few short years ago when he had rashard lewis on the other wing
4277130 here you say you have richard jefferson on another wing youre putting luke ridnour in the best possible position to be successful again as he has been in the past
4277131 our challenge from day one has been to shape our roster in a way that our fans will see a team that is competitive that plays hard every night and has a chance to win
4277132 we feel this trade continues to move us toward that goal for this season and beyond
4277133 what we need is stuff installed and what we need is people to make sure its going to work and what we need is for the umpires to understand the protocol what we need is to make sure that everyone whos participating understands it
4277134 ive never met michael phelps i havent watched any events ive just been getting ready for my events
4277135 he made a small mistake in his first loss in berlin and there were articles coming out saying is lashawn taking over
4277136 and jeremy was reading that and making adjustments to his race that he didnt need to make
4277137 the loss at the trials did a lot for me
4277138 i know how hard lashawns working and its made me work harder staying focused
4277139 michael johnson and i were watching him during the press conference and we both said hes ready
4277140 when hes ready to run i dont even hear from him ive barely seen him all week hes just staying at the village and training thats when you know
4277141 my legs are fresh and ill be ready for monday
4277142 i am thrilled to be in a place ive never been that offers so much and on such a vast scale black lung disease being the exception
4277143 troy university has always been interested in providing opportunities for young people to better themselves and this is a situation where a young man who has made some mistakes is looking for a second chance
4277144 i have met with josh and i am convinced that he is ready and willing to do the things we need for him to do to be a productive member of both this football team and the troy university community
4277145 i am thrilled to be in a place ive never been that offers so much and on such a vast scale black lung disease being the exception
4277146 get me to the track so i can do my thing
4277147 after the positive response received from the fans in mexico city last year espn is proud to bring x games back for a second time
4277148 as the x franchise continues to grow globally we truly appreciate the on going support that the people of mexico have given us and we look forward to another successful event this year
4277149 we are pleased to be associated with modelo light telcel lala shot vans bansefi and telemex and with ocesa to bring the x games to mexico city after its successful mexico city debut in 2007
4277150 last year we had 30 athletes from 12 different countries and this year we will again have the most outstanding athletes in the world competing side by side with our prominent mexican athletes on top quality courses espn is excited about this opportunity to expand upon our great relationship with sports fans throughout the country
4277151 i am thrilled to be in a place ive never been that offers so much and on such a vast scale black lung disease being the exception
4277152 good god john edwards was having sex with the daughter of the guy who taught tommy burns how to kill horses by electrocuting them
4277153 an ostensibly jaded cocaine addled sexually voracious 20 year old who was shall we say inspired by lisa
4277154 when tommy arrived at a show they would say the sandman was around they knew a horse would be put to sleep
4277155 i dont want to break his leg im not into that
4277156 they go down immediately one horse dropped so fast in the stall he must have broken his neck when he hit the floor its a sick thing i know but it was quick and it was painless they didnt suffer
4277157 on the bus rides when were riding over from the village i find myself reminiscing every day
4277158 just kind of thinking back to what happened yesterday what happened this morning
4277159 i dont want to forget i dont want to miss a moment
4277160 we dont know what were going to do without this
4277161 every time i think about it i want to start crying its the sport we love and it got taken away
4277162 the other countries are getting better theyre getting closer thats what is unfortunate they cut softball and add bmx come on the old athletes in greece do you think they rode bikes
4277163 when we come to the gold medal game next week theres going to be a certain feeling of emptiness
4277164 weve had hundreds and hundreds of e mails from little kids all over the world about their dreams of being in the olympics i think that probably affected me that we let them down thats why weve got to try to bring it back
4277165 at the end of the day ill take it right between the eyes if that means that hurts our sport to me thats an oxymoron how can you be punished for being good at something it seems like its not what sport is all about
4277166 but this is where we are were going to go for the gold and then well deal with the repercussions quote unquote if there are any
4277167 so i am just trying to put on a smile
4277168 the problem i am going to have with the stories that will be written about this is that it was not just alicia or her mistakes
4277169 it was not one person alicia knows she didnt do her job and she is an emotional person so shell beat herself up for a while but im afraid the reaction could be quite devastating to her
4277170 i experienced opening ceremonies for the first time this year
4277171 and what i took away is the olympics is not about one athlete or one moment it is about the team and world and the impact these athletes make on the world no matter how well they perform
4277172 i bet i would wipe the floor with you in a league
4277173 yall come on over here and check this out i promise we wont bite
4277174 alright boys the race team is yours good luck im headed to the golf course
4277175 good god john edwards was having sex with the daughter of the guy who taught tommy burns how to kill horses by electrocuting them
4277176 an ostensibly jaded cocaine addled sexually voracious 20 year old who was shall we say inspired by lisa
4277177 when tommy arrived at a show they would say the sandman was around they knew a horse would be put to sleep
4277178 i dont want to break his leg im not into that
4277179 they go down immediately one horse dropped so fast in the stall he must have broken his neck when he hit the floor its a sick thing i know but it was quick and it was painless they didnt suffer
4277180 hold on to your horses boys this ones not over
4277181 its a good thing john didnt play for the beaneaters
4277182 i wondered if nike would have the nerve to keep the one non nike athlete dwight howard from the spotlight its galling howard is a ghost almost never on the screen at all we are told again and again that nothing matters more than representing your nation being a selfless teammate and being patriotic then we dont see dwight howard and we do see archival footage of michael jordan covering the reebok logo on his team usa warmups with an american flag so nothing matters more than all that stuff except perhaps your choice in sports apparel brands
4277183 flip over to the ballgame and see if the rain delay is over yet
4277184 its a mystery at this point all the asbestos work was done
4277185 this in no way will delay our efforts to develop tech town
4277186 how can i trust that youre giving me the best price
4277187 you think youre doing a good job but when you are witnessing triple digit increases annually you also worry that you lose sight of the bigger objective of why you got into the business in the first place
4277188 my primary concern has always been to exceed the expectations of both our clients and linguists first ive always believed that profitability would follow
4277189 perhaps thats not the way they would teach it at wharton but the model has worked well we saw this upward trajectory starting in the middle of last year and made some organizational changes we believed were necessary to ensure our service levels didnt drop since that time weve continued to see growth in our core sectors but as a result have been able to expand to other areas including federal our objective is not to be the biggest although thats not a bad thing but to continue to have a benchmark in outstanding service and delivery and i think weve achieved that but well continue to earn it on a daily basis all in all im very grateful to our clients for placing their trust in our service what more can i say
4277190 to sell out this section for a second straight year is impressive but even more so when you consider that we doubled the size of the family area for 2008
4277191 uc athletics is committed to providing substantial value to all of our season ticket patrons and entry level packages like the family plan and the bearcat lair are both affordable and excellent viewing areas to take in cincinnatis college football team with a record number of season tickets sold for 2008 were are excited for the coming season and look forward to the first game against eastern kentucky on the 28th
4277192 its not important how many people you have on the bus but having the right people on the bus
4277193 the majority of our international personnel speak english so we really dont have a need
4277194 what an amazing opportunity to work with an all star team
4277195 to follow in the footsteps of rick gillette to work on tony coles programming team and the chance to work for earl jones wow
4277196 miren al otro lado de la valla y observen como tratan a la gente incluso a sus ciudadanos
4277197 even loan modification offers which seem etched in stone may be negotiable
4277198 a compelling argument as to why different terms would be in the lenders best interest
4277199 the threat of legal exposure is a great bargaining tool
4277200 if the loan was made in violation to tila or had predatory characteristics rendering the loan illegal the borrowers threat of legal action against the lender could result in leverage and enhance the borrowers ability to secure better terms for loan mod
4277201 by agreeing to a mortgage modification to save your home from foreclosure you may feel as if youve dodged a bullet
4277202 you may have but if your loan was made in bad faith had predatory characteristics a loan the originator knew you could not afford told you one thing but delivered something else at closing charged excessive fees etc or if your loan is one of millions of mortgage loans made in violation to federal truth in lending law you may be shortchanging yourself
4277203 all i can do is be me whoever that is
4277204 were pleased with the ruling and will proceed forward as appropriate
4277205 whatever comes of all that ill continue to have peace
4277206 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them that are called according to his purpose
4277207 they did an incredible job to try and revive him they worked on him for over two hours but in vain
4277208 we never even considered the possibility they would do it before we asked
4277209 they certainly decided it was important enough on their own
4277210 utter deference to the executive to decide what it wanted and to do what it wanted and to violate the law
4277211 people have taken many risks and made many sacrifices to be here and just because ice says come here they arent going to leave everything behind
4277212 so whats the point the point is to make a splash
4277213 my clients experience suggests they brought an indictment without careful evaluation of the evidence
4277214 they essentially took out the entire organization in one fell swoop
4277215 no quiero hacer un performance con britney spears en los vma
4277216 i have never given it any thought at all until you asked the question that was never in my mind as an engineer
4277217 i think youd be better off making sure your tires are properly inflated and try to do minimal acceleration and deceleration
4277218 your total loss factor due to vapor is 8 3 times ten to the minus 4th which is ridiculously small
4277219 its just not worth the effort to worry about it for the rest of us typical everyday drivers
4277220 so youre losing about point 8 pounds of gas which is less than a seventh of a gallon of gas a year
4277221 keeping your tires inflated at the proper pressure is the no 1 thing you can do to get better gas mileage
4277222 donne moi ton nom si tu le souhaites je ne te le demande pas
4277223 basically the sign in sheet is outside the secure area you can tell the secure area because at the top left of your brower if it says http thats generally not secure says ian taylor
4277224 if you dont see the https and you dont see the lock that means that its pretty much wide open
4277225 weve had a few comments on there and it is a secure website but it wouldnt be secure if someone was using an unsecure networks
4277226 you dont have to use the online version we have a hard copy in our book or we do have the pdfs on the website
4277227 youve got to be careful off the tee to hit the fairways thats going to be the key all week
4277228 i got off to a great start and made tons of putts
4277229 i missed a few opportunities on the second nine but i made a birdie to finish on a high note so im very pleased
4277230 i cant remember the last time i had 10 putts on nine holes
4277231 jesus christ superstar who in the hell do you think you are
4277232 separate and unequaled black baseball in the district of columbia
4277233 gangs of lazy negroes were hanging around the area to watch
4277234 separate and unequaled black baseball in the district of columbia has some wonderful surprises
4277235 were very pleased to see weve made such significant gains among the middle schools
4277236 the trims mark the first time in several years p amp g has made a major pullback in media spending in its final fiscal quarter and are seen by some industry watchers as a bad sign heading into the companys fourth quarter earnings announcement set for aug 5
4277237 its my opinion that the average publisher has little to no interest in going the extra mile to ensure that advertisers achieve optimal results when the market is hot and advertisers are competing fiercely for a finite number of eyeballs theres little incentive for publishers to do anything other than deliver access to an audience and cash the checks this can be seen in the attitudes exhibited by people like duncan riley who like to focus on all the money flowing into the online advertising space but rarely ever discuss just what advertisers are getting in return for their money in other words there are a lot of takers but fewer givers
4277238 we can see from this report that silver surfers are not into social media or comparison engines and are intending to spend more as the downturn does not touch them
4277239 but on the other hand a whole group of more financially pressed people who now use social media to make decisions and then comparison engines to find the best deal
4277240 complexity rules and simple strategies will fail if online retailers dont enter your comment below and press submit when complete
4277241 most have made decisions about what theyre going to offer on jan 1 around labor day
4277242 from our survey data we know that employers are expecting their costs are going to go up about 10 but theyre planning on managing that increase to somewhere around 6 5
4277243 the difference in those two numbers is pretty much what goes on during the renewal negotiation process
4277244 most organizations probably take their business out to bid every three to five years
4277245 larger companies tend to not bid their business as often because its difficult to make a large sweeping change smaller companies can have the flexibility to bid their business every year if they so desire
4277246 if you change carriers youre going to disrupt employees provider relationships
4277247 its important to look at that if you care about employee disruption
4277248 we compare the employers current premium rates employee contributions and plan design features to the surveys and that helps them understand where they can make some modifications and still remain competitive
4277249 the economy is pretty tough right now and people are feeling the impact of higher gasoline prices
4277250 employers are very sensitive to not shifting health care costs if they dont have to because of that
4277251 employers are looking to balance their cost targets against the need to provide competitive and adequate health care coverage
4277252 it appears employers are trying to give employees a choice between paying more out of their paycheck to keep first dollar coverage or paying less out of their paycheck but being a little bit more at risk when they need care the latter being more like how one might buy car insurance
4277253 employers who were thinking about offering them are getting into it and those who have them are making them more attractive
4277254 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4277255 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is pedaling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4277256 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4277257 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds
4277258 there is a compelling marketing rationale so you can understand why a fund company wants to do this but from an investors perspective based on the real results seen so far there is no compelling reason to choose 130 30s over other approaches
4277259 they are trying to present this as a safer way of investing as a way to make money or lose less in all market conditions but the results just havent shown that
4277260 we are trying to build up our applicant pool so we have more people on our state registers where we can hire from
4277261 we know we put people behind bars for breaking the law you have to have folks that are studying the crime to put the individuals behind bars and we have a significant backlog in that regard
4277262 i wont say crime running rampant but certainly you dont have enough folks to deal with the crime that is happening
4277263 we wanted a safe cream that we could put the caffeine into
4277264 wed like to understand the mechanism what is most important is to see whether these moisturizing creams are tumorigenic in people
4277265 i dont think that people should be scared because this is a mouse study and we dont know whether or not it applies to humans
4277266 this is a pretty artificial situation with the mouse skin primed by a lot of uv light to develop cancer
4277267 non melanoma skin cancer in man is very very common and is almost 100 percent curable with an operation usually simpler than a tooth filling
4277268 they are things that are commonly used in many moisturizing creams
4277269 theyre really learning something new for the first time a lot of guys are in new positions they never played before i think theyre just learning working hard and trying to get better at what we have them doing right now
4277270 you cant describe it unless youre in that game it was fun last year where i was a junior but i cant wait until this year where its my last year
4277271 if imitation is the best form of flattery then im flattered
4277272 the results are fantastic coming from these groups which were each paid 1 million to spend three years showing that i was wrong
4277273 if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4277274 i proved that i played with the best tonight and it couldnt have happened to me on a better stage
4277275 it was one of the goals of the season for me to do well here
4277276 this obviously is a big blow because i expected more
4277277 ive played him on many occasions but i think this was the best ive seen him
4277278 im happy for him hes a good guy i hope he can go all the way now
4277279 i missed some key shots that i probably shouldnt have missed that was that
4277280 not much i could do about it so it was definitely a surprise result for me
4277281 work only evil overlords on a case by case basis
4277282 oh i had a gun in my carrying case which was given to me by a marvelous marvelous engraver
4277283 last year at the telethon of 07 he presented me with this gorgeous gift he presented it to me in the telethon office in 07 i put it in that traveling case and i hadnt traveled since that telethon til that day
4277284 it wouldnt be a weapon and we couldnt cite him for carrying a weapon
4277285 i do this out of a sense of participating in democracy
4277286 when the opportunity came up to take our electric guitars and make some unholy noise to try to stop a war it sounded familiar to me
4277287 its something we did 40 years ago as part of a generation that said the war in vietnam was wrong and needed to stop were part of a generation saying the war in iraq is wrong and needs to stop
4277288 os n meros apresentados no fechamento do primeiro semestre de 2008 em rela o s vendas dom sticas de produtos sider rgicos refletem o bom momento da economia brasileira
4277289 no meu caso e acredito que com outras pessoas tamb m acontece isso simplesmente dizemos bom ent o n o vamos isolar mais o telhado
4277290 n o temos nenhum problema com o uso da energia solar
4277291 marburg j l der quando se fala em uso de energia solar mas eles sempre tentaram convencer a popula o em vez de for la
4277292 n o foi uma boa id ia decidir obrigar as pessoas acho que dessa forma voc cria opositores em vez de amigos da energia solar
4277293 temos um problema de energia s rio com as casas mais antigas
4277294 antes as instala es solares eram a exce o e a aus ncia delas era a regra
4277295 queremos atingir uma situa o que seja justamente o contr rio
4277296 o que estamos fazendo em marburg bom e avan ado e n s e outras cidades precisamos seguir em frente com iniciativas similares a essa
4277297 a economia de t quio est indo bem hoje em dia
4277298 mas o restante do jap o ainda n o se recuperou a economia est muito fraca no interior ent o vemos um grande n mero de consultas por todo o pa s sobre d vidas especialmente de pessoas com assuntos urgentes
4277299 ou penso eu muitos deles apenas se resignaram aos seus destinos
4277300 japoneses por natureza n o gostam de divulgar seus problemas
4277301 e falar com um advogado significa admitir que h problemas em casa ou no trabalho
4277302 por estar em frente esta o de trem todos saber o se uma pessoa vier at aqui se eu estivesse instalado em uma parte mais discreta da cidade as pessoas poderiam pensar que este n o um neg cio leg timo e que n o sou uma pessoa do bem
4277303 agora que h um advogado por perto mais pessoas devem falar com ele ao inv s de vir a n s buscando ajuda
4277304 first in the world to see our latest game in action
4277305 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments
4277306 they said a wife of one of the ss officers they called her the bitch of buchenwald saw a tattoo she liked on the arm of a prisoner and had the skin made into a lampshade i saw that
4277307 they grabbed him round the shoulder and slit his throat
4277308 there were five of them they had arrived from south ossetia in a jeep they were going across the village from house to house
4277309 there are bodies everywhere i saw hundreds of dead there are people lying in the streets
4277310 the villages of kurta chala and eredvi are full of corpses
4277311 they said in russian where are the boys and where is your car i didnt understand one of them was ossetian and he translated i told them id sold my car and they went away but then some others turned up
4277312 they asked me where my basement was and shot it up
4277313 my husband died 14 years ago i wished i had died soon after him
4277314 i had my childhood during the second world war the situation was terrible now im so old and im in a war again
4277315 we will make the reconstruction of public service facilities such as schools and hospitals our priority and turn them into extremely safe and solid structures that the public can feel reassured about
4277316 as well as a home our biggest need is justice for my dead child but i know that is something that nobody can help us with
4277317 funds from american churches were used to build these houses now american taxpayers money is going to knock them down for a road the people dont really want but usaid said it is not going to bend
4277318 the soaring price of petrol has made hotel owners gas and electricity bills even bigger
4277319 many customers grow tired or disillusioned when confronted by the rise in prices which hasnt necessarily been accompanied by an improvement in the quality of service
4277320 this morning two females appeared before the chief magistrates at st johns magistrates court having been arrested and charged with offences connected to the murders
4277321 at this stage we are not in a position to disclose any further information as the inquiry continues however further information will be provided in due course when appropriate to do so
4277322 the force is continuing its support of the investigation and family liaison officers are continuing to support the families and keep them fully updated on events both in the uk and antigua
4277323 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4277324 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4277325 steve hadley the us national security adviser voiced objections to ahmadinejads trip when he visited ankara a month ago
4277326 the attitude was weve allowed them to host manouchehr mottaki and saeed jalili respectively irans foreign minister and chief nuclear negotiator but having ahmadinejad was sending the wrong signal
4277327 however the turks explained that he had been pressing for a visit to turkey for a while and that they couldnt say no any longer to meet american reservations they promised they wouldnt sign any major energy deals apart from maybe something on electricity and would pressure ahmadinejad to accept the un security council incentive package in exchange for suspending uranium enrichment
4277328 it is our neighbour after all its realpolitik we are obliged to this evil
4277329 the new projections move up some of the changes that are happening the minority population now will become the majority eight or nine years earlier than we had thought
4277330 it means theres going to be a young old divide
4277331 but the over 65s will primarily remain white and will stay that way the challenge for any national politician will be appealing to such diverse interests at both ends of the spectrum
4277332 to end the war in the pacific and save lives
4277333 japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped
4277334 police booked his ticket from ho chi minh city to london and i have paid for the ticket on his behalf
4277335 we dont want the collapse of georgia but the de facto situation is such that neither the south ossetians nor the abkhaz want to live in the same state with the person who has sent his troops against them
4277336 that we support any decision taken by the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia we will not only support them but guarantee them in the caucasus and in the whole world right is on your side
4277337 the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia are not called into question in future talks
4277338 any reference to the territorial integrity of georgia would simply be seen as an insult a deeply human insult
4277339 property prices have more than doubled since march one house is going for 90 000 a threefold increase
4277340 the uk is getting close to what we set out to achieve
4277341 there is a view the militia is going to come back its not going to happen we are not going to see parts of basra going back to militia control
4277342 in the long term iran wants a stable democracy in iraq a stable neighbour with a shia majority in the short term it is totally legitimate that there is iranian influence in southern iraq culturally and religious
4277343 the assassinations are back especially in the last two weeks just like before
4277344 two men on a motorbike have been shooting people and five barbers have been killed in the last week alone the militiamen and some of the commanders of the mahdi army are still there they dont carry weapons in public but they are still there a few months ago if you wanted to import anything through the port you had to bribe the mahdi army officials who controlled the port now the iraqi army and the government are in control so you only bribe one official now there is no work apart from collecting garbage it doesnt matter if you are an engineer or a college graduate and you have to bribe someone in the municipality to get work as a street sweeper
4277345 the mahdi army doesnt exist publicly but the killers and assassins are still there and people are still getting killed though less than before the militiamen are wearing government uniforms
4277346 the army raids remind us of what the baathists and saddams mukhabarat secret police used to do we thought that after saddam we would be living in a new iraq but the same system is back for example now the directorate of education is controlled by a new militia theyve started replacing headteachers with their own men
4277347 there is less kidnapping and killing but the militiamen are still there though they are not armed in the streets there are so many of them they cant arrest them if they did theyd have to arrest half of basra if you are a state employee then life is good but if you dont have a fixed salary then things are very hard
4277348 hopes of identifying ashes are almost non existent since it is impossible to carry out dna testing

4277351 we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
4277352 we are not there to defend the ports we are there to provide humanitarian aid
4277353 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4277354 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4277355 is a member state of the united nations and its internationally recognised borders need to be respected the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4277356 georgia is an independent and sovereign state and i think this formula the principle of sovereignty is broader than the formula of territorial integrity
4277357 aujourdhui tu nas juste pas le droit daller l glise kuankie si tu y vas nous te fracasserons les jambes

4277360 of course you need a medals target with ambitions and national governing bodies knowing about their public funding but actually they golds are big british moments no one says you finished 10th or 12th in the medals table they remember kelly chris hoy or nicole cooke
4277361 people are already excited about how were doing here how long is it since we won a gold in the pool on the opening day and we had another gold in the road cycling they know its a step change they recognise already that its a more successful olympic games than weve ever had before

4277363 ralph has cornered the market in corporate strategic communications and grassroots using his social conservative base combined with his personal communications skills and his influence in the bush reelection campaign

4277370 we translated it directly we wanted to stay true to the original as a matter of fact we keep the original japanese in there
4277371 the way that works is when a character falls you have three turns to get to them and you have to get to them before an enemy unit does
4277372 if you do that it calls in a medic and you can save your character and bring them out later in a couple of turns but if you dont then are gone forever in the case of main story characters that will end the game
4277373 we had thought about it at one point in time we did consider putting it on the xbox but the change was made for many reasons as a ps3 exclusive
4277374 well you know the response we got from that accidental announcement was very interesting ill have to leave it as that for now
4277375 if we get rid of all wishful thinking and dubious metaphysical speculations we can hardly doubt that at a time not too distant each one of us will simply cease to be

4277382 we consider this video though it names no one to be a photographic list of an anti semitic nature and therefore liable to criminal prosecution
4277383 i dont think a lot of the criticism is fair but the sec has not done as good a job in describing its role and what it was doing immediately prior to the collapse of bear stearns
4277384 the sec has not had a champion with the treasury and the chairman has chosen not to make his case for the agency loudly mr cox is a team player and doesnt want to be seen as at odds with the treasury but the people thinking up policy are naturally favourable to the fed
4277385 there is growing bifurcation between investor and consumer protection on the one hand and the safety and stability of markets on the other and we are at a watershed
4277386 the debate now is about whether the market stability function will go with the fed or with a new executive arm
4277387 one place it is not going to go is the sec frankly there has never been evidence that the sec has the tools or the culture to deal with market stability issues it has an enforcement culture with strengths in fraud company filings and disclosure rules
4277388 as the credit crunch has unfolded the sec has looked superfluous partly that is because of its remit but partly it is because of the natural hesitancy and reticence of christopher cox and his senior advisers about what is the proper role of governments in markets they believe in letting institutions shake out hank paulson us treasury secretary and mr bernanke have proven themselves survivalists who have been able to overcome their predilection towards market forces

4277410 i think it might take little while later she arrived
4277411 remember you are in sync with the evergreen so you come here very quickly in a coma from the united states it would take longer for her soul to find their own way here
4277412 if we want to extravehicular activity how can we recover
4277413 you do not have to worry the united states i can send you back to the city now if you want to
4277414 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4277415 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4277416 in a sense theyve got obama hostage and are exacting their ransom
4277417 in my view shes sticking up for her delegates and shes going to take a lot of heat for this

4277435 in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew
4277436 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases
4277437 in accordance with faa procedures for handling these matters we have requested to meet with the faa after we have had time to thoroughly review their findings so that we may discuss the issues since these matters are ongoing with the faa we will not have any further comment at this time
4277438 we take seriously any threats to extort money from anyone

4277445 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization
4277446 i dont know if the readings are going to get anyone to admit they have a problem my goal is to open up a space for dialogue

4277458 lo peor que puede hacer en este momento la directiva es buscar alg n cambio no de cuerpo t cnico sino de la forma de pensar estamos todos en el barco el cuerpo t cnico que lleg es muy capaz creo que vamos por buen camino lo nico que nos falta es saber ganar un partido porque creo que despu s de la victoria frente a am rica el equipo se ve a como uno de los candidatos y hoy con dos derrotas consecutivas el equipo como que se quiere caer y yo creo que no la gente que es m s grande los chavos que est n empujando de atr s tenemos que seguir por la misma l nea tratar de confiar en el cuerpo t cnico en la dirigencia y tratar de ganar el domingo con el apoyo de la gente
4277459 creo que es momento de ponernos a pensar todos buscar la mejora para el equipo creo que los culpables siempre vamos a ser todos no podemos estar buscando culpables porque no ayudamos a crecer este equipo nosotros que estamos jugando debemos tratar de buscar una soluci n junto con el cuerpo t cnico y confiar a muerte yo creo que el equipo est por momentos se triangula bien se tiene posibilidad de gol pero bueno hay que tratar de jugar un partido perfecto porque ya vimos que tenemos uno o dos descuidos y terminamos perdiendo
4277460 creo que el cuerpo t cnico tiene la soluci n sabe de que h ctor mancilla jugando arriba por m s de que este solo tiene la llegada de varios compa eros a lo mejor por momentos no sale o se pierde una pelota y perdemos confianza el equipo tiene que seguir por el mismo camino hoy estoy m s tranquilo que la derrota ante pumas la derrota ante pumas s me doli mucho por la forma de los ltimos minutos ante chivas por lo menos el equipo muere parado lo nico que nos duele es que va la cuarta fecha y el equipo s lo tiene tres puntos
4277461 yo sigo confiando en este equipo confi en el cuerpo t cnico se est haciendo un buen trabajo lastimosamente para que el trabajo sea perfecto tienen que acompa ar los resultados lastimosamente los resultados no nos est n acompa ando entonces tenemos la suerte en tres d as de tener otra final y tenemos que ganar como sea
4277462 el ambiente en m xico es muy bueno la gente habla de este enfrentamiento todos los d as y en honduras pasa igual es el pan nuestro de cada d a y el ambiente es excelente en cuanto al nivel de futbol es parejo honduras trae lo mejor sus mejores jugadores de europa y m xico tambi n la ventaja es que honduras tiene m s tiempo de preparaci n mientras nosotros estamos hablando honduras est entrenando y m xico se concentra hasta el lunes pero m xico tiene el estadio azteca y es un escenario que a muchos todav a les da p nico
4277463 vamos en b squeda de un buen resultado no te digo que un triunfo porque tampoco hay que echar las campanas al vuelo sacar un empate en el azteca ser a muy bueno
4277464 este equipo tiene grandes figuras como david suazo wilson palacios tiene varios jugadores juveniles en italia y puede ser la generaci n con mejor preparaci n en la historia
4277465 me llama la atenci n que m xico es un pa s cien por ciento mexicano y hay tres jugadores naturalizados pero igual no importa si est n dispuestos a sudar la camisa en honduras no se da mucho eso me llam la convocatoria de cuauht moc blanco y el hecho de que eriksson dijo que le ten a fe admiro sus cualidades y no pasa de moda es el goleador de siempre de m xico

4277469 el equipo tiene que estar preparado para todo y vamos listos
4277470 entendiendo que el partido no est f cil el juego de que vamos a enfrentar a un equipo herido que no ha tenido buena fortuna pero ser muy dif cil
4277471 va existir mucha presi n as que el equipo tiene que estar preparado para todo y vamos listos
4277472 llegamos bien con confianza sobre todo el equipo ha encontrado un funcionamiento bueno con la ilusi n de mantenernos bien en el torneo y no regalar absolutamente nada
4277473 ah vamos sin prisa buscando un buen equilibrio que es el de visitante y tambi n el de local el equipo a mantenido una estabilidad una continuidad y eso nos permite hacerlo estamos bien pero creo que podemos mejorar mucho pues sobre todas las cosas no hay conformismo y si el torneo pasado fuimos un buen visitante pues hoy tenemos que ser un buen local
4277474 es un caso complicado que nos preocupa a todos hoy estamos cada quien desde su parte m s sentimental m s rom ntica de nuestra parte de m s fe deseando y pidi ndole a dios que l tenga una buena recuperaci n y que quede bien sin secuelas

4277480 no planteo la posibilidad de una derrota nosotros siempre somos muy positivos de y enfrentamos cada partido con la intenci n de ganar no nos gusta ver qu pasar a si no ganamos m s bien vamos con la mentalidad ganadora porque una de las cosas que ha distinguido a la comarca lagunera y al santos es la mentalidad de triunfo lo que tenemos que hacer es tener un compromiso de salir a ganar cada partido empezando por este domingo
4277481 cuando el equipo sale con la mentalidad adecuada cuando se entrega en la cancha no hay equipo que le gane no veo por qu pensar de manera negativa m s bien hay que pensar positivamente porque vamos a recuperar los puntos dejados en estas fechas
4277482 venimos trabajando bien desde la pretemporada yo siento que nos est costando trabajo el inicio pero nos hemos parado bien a excepci n del juego con am rica que tuvimos algunos descuidos pero en t rminos generales siento que el equipo va evolucionando y va a mejorar su accionar de eso no tengo la menor duda
4277483 estoy sorprendido por la llamada del seleccionador y me siento preparado para el reto creo que es un momento clave para jugar con la selecci n
4277484 vi todos los partidos y me alegr mucho con el triunfo
4277485 les damos gracias primero a dios segundo a m dicos amigos directivos de su trabajo compa eros de equipo afici n medios de comunicaci n y por supuesto a instituciones futbol sticas y afici n de otros equipos por ese efusivo apoyo por ser solidarios en oraci n para que siga de pie y que logre vencer el mal provocado

4277495 during a photo session where the spanish national team was unveiled one of our sponsors asked us to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing and we made an oriental expression with our eyes

4277497 i want to express that we have great respect for the orient and its people some of my best friends in toronto are of chinese origin
4277498 even though the chinese community has a long history of settlement in spain the spanish population still considers the chinese as a closed and somewhat mysterious community references to exaggerated stereotypes and prejudices regarding their activities and social organization can often be overheard in daily conversations

4277532 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4277533 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4277534 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4277535 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4277536 what he really wanted to talk about is best summarised in his very powerful manifesto freedom of captives the opening of blind eyes and liberty for the oppressed
4277537 knowing jesus has meant that i have accomplished what his manifesto set out to do
4277538 eeek thats a pretty bold statement reckon hes finished with ya what he really wanted to talk about is best summarised in his very powerful manifesto freedom of captives the opening of blind eyes and liberty for the oppressed
4277539 i think if we set out to do this in the name of jesus then people will realign themselves with god and come back into relationship with god
4277540 therefore our overarching aim should be to bring glory to god and it is by that standard we should measure our success

4277558 of course i mean for a lot of americans including the family that i grew up with i mean its fundamental to how you judge people and human character whether you keep your word whether you keep what is your ultimate word which is that you love your spouse and youll stay with them i think the most important qualities in a president in todays world are trustworthiness sincerity honesty strength of leadership and and certainly that goes to a part of that

4277570 in seeking a higher quality sexual experience the number of well heeled women that lead more adventurous and exotic sex lives have had an affair or joined the mile high club far outdistances that of men and the affluent gender gap in views on sex doesnt end there
4277571 the majority of men and women credit their private wealth with achieving a better sex life when viewed separately a larger percentage of women agree with the statement perhaps indicating that females derive a greater degree of empowerment from their financial independence than their male counterparts
4277572 money as an aphrodisiac being rich means getting lucky on your own terms
4277573 it is difficult to identify the benchmark for adventurous and exotic sex since what might entice one person could leave another indifferent
4277574 but the much higher response rate from wealthy women once again underscores the liberating byproducts of money as it relates to sexual exploration
4277575 had bill clinton carry al gore around on his back
4277576 some seem to believe that we should negotiate with the terrorists and radicals as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along we have heard this foolish delusion before as nazi tanks crossed into poland in 1939 an american senator declared lord if i could only have talked to hitler all this might have been avoided we have an obligation to call this what it is the false comfort of appeasement which has been repeatedly discredited by history
4277577 sen obama has called for talking with iran and syria
4277578 suggested surrendering to these countries demands which is after all what appeasement is
4277579 you dont understand theres a difference between talking to the enemy and appeasing what neville chamberlain did wrong is not talking to hitler but giving him half of czechoslovakia
4277580 the wave of the islamic revolution will soon reach the entire world

4277584 toward the end of my deadline i felt like i was going to have a mental break down there are no words that can express the mental anguish that i was made to feel throughout the day

4277589 we dont tell these women how to parent their children
4277590 they took advantage of their knowledge of my history of being an abuse victim and my desperate circumstances to intimidate me into accepting the abuse that they heaped on me
4277591 i later realized that like a battered woman my loyalties were still to my abuser
4277592 we never even considered the possibility they would do it before we asked

4277610 i think public opinion is more concerned with economic issues the economy isnt very good and there are worries about social inequalities
4277611 do not be fooled when the administration claims it is merely tweaking the law
4277612 the cumulative impact of these changes equals a full blown attack on americas premier conservation law we owe it to future generations to stop this attack and continue our legacy of protecting wildlife on the brink of extinction
4277613 watch them almost break all of the rules and get down and dirty order now and get your free at amp t telecom immunity tote bag
4277614 protest zones im an unabashed obama supporter but as much as i like him i like the rights to free speech and free association even more the dems shouldve rejected the idea of free speech zones outright as a symbol of the constitution hating bush
4277615 what about the security concerns of the protesters they want to secure the bill of rights they want to secure peace and an end to foreign occupations they want to secure themselves from arrest for bullsh t crimes i guess these are the rare cases where the freedom to tyranize trumps security
4277616 this war now belongs to the democrats no less than the republicans if it is left to mccain and obama the occupation will continue for years it was wrong to go into iraq its wrong to stay in iraq its wrong not to get out now if there is not a strong showing from the anti war movement against this whole direction outside the convention it will signal those who make war and the victims of these wars around the world that the people of this country will go along with continued occupation with mccain or obama sending many more troops to afghanistan and with threats to iran the bush regime promised a war to last generations are we against this or not the anti war movement must set a standard of resistance not accommodate what is intolerable only the people not the politicians can force open debate over why the u s occupation must end now only we can act on our convictions letting others know that an end to the illegal unjust and immoral wars and occupations will not happen without massive mobilization of the people and that putting all your hopes and energies into the elections will not bring the change millions desire
4277617 ive had three knee operations and i think the deepest darkest moment was at the end of november last year i had the third knee operation in september and started building up then i had knee pains again i thought id gone i thought it was over after that operation i was on the road to recovery and for the knee to start hurting again that was the worst moment of my sporting career
4277618 there was so much suffering for me i thought there is a dream out there but while there is so much mental pain every day i dont think i can go on i remember talking to my parents and they said look do what you want to do they only wanted to see me happy they didnt want to put any pressure on for the results
4277619 the track lads have all told me how they were cheering me when they watched it it was just so much happiness with the cycling team because we know how hard we have to work for our results there is so much respect that everyone just wants the best for everyone else there is genuine good feeling there so ill turn up at the velodrome and cheer on the lads in athens team mate rachel heal and i went together to the first day it was very emotional being there to see chris hoy win
4277620 we knew nicole was capable of winning and emma was capable of a great ride but for them both to deliver is a real boost
4277621 had an option to make the deal permanent at any stage so i spoke to him and asked him if he would be happy to stay he has been at the club for four or five weeks now and he said he would so he now becomes our record signing
4277622 we wish marlon all the best he is a good pro and he made a contribution last season he has worked hard in pre season and has made an impact but he has chosen to move on for the time being
4277623 the video is a crystal clear case of fair use its 100 legal and non infringing and the ioc has absolutely no right to force the video out of view

4277628 test cricket must have primacy as far as the ecb is concerned and nothing has changed india have long been aware of our views
4277629 this is an important agreement for the security of the united states for the security of poland and the security of our nato allies
4277630 in no way is the presidents plan for russia in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it
4277631 we do take very seriously the concerns of our ally
4277632 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4277633 in five seven or 10 years we want to be sufficiently well equipped and well trained to be ready both with our allies but by ourselves to defend ourselves at a critical moment
4277634 committed to close cooperation with poland in the event of a danger from a third party
4277635 a new element to take our security agreement to a new level

4277638 my instincts are that brian oneill is a tough guy with a lot of staying power
4277639 its a hit but its not the bigger part of his portfolio by any means
4277640 was a very good amenity for our projects it was good and we certainly hope it will be rebuilt
4277641 the average clip got more views on youtube in three months 3 092 than on the next eight video sites combined 2 092
4277642 hes interacting with us hes giving good eye contact hes you know being social all these things he wasnt doing
4277643 it would mean that he probably would not make the progress that he has been making putting him further behind by the time he hits school
4277644 in the past weve been able to ask for supplemental allocations but the state has indicated this year that we will not be able to do that
4277645 i just dont think the need was anticipated to be as great as it turned out to be theres a large number of people who need these services badly
4277646 we are very pleased with the progress hes made and we dont want it to stop
4277647 these now are what used to be 20 foot irrigation pipes now they cut em in half with a torch and made em 10 foot irrigation pipes which theyre not usable to our farm now but were gonna scrap em
4277648 you know were not state of the art when it comes to keeping all the information but we do have a lot of conscientious folks here
4277649 if we can put some folks behind bars and stop them from stealing stuff then thats great
4277650 the farmers they have a tough way of making a living their work is really hard and for this to happen to someone who spends 12 14 hours in the field it makes it hard for them to recover

4277669 is this truly barack obamas moment martin is he the spiritual heir to your i have a dream ethos or will he succumb to worldly pragmatism and do whatever it takes to win
4277670 like every man he finds himself resisting the temptation to take shortcuts
4277671 he is so close to grasping the prize that he can almost taste it but there is danger in this moment as well there are many sick and deluded men and women who will not abide his election to the highest office of the land what will their rage compel them to do about it
4277672 my brother loves this man now i can see why he is as charismatic as you once were
4277673 this young man definitely has more kennedy in him than king
4277674 even we dont have the right to see the future martin but i still have a good feeling about it
4277675 we have the rest of eternity to learn and absorb that truth
4277676 as far as we are concerned the british grand prix is moving to donington in 2010 what we now have to do is knuckle down and work to ensure that silverstone remains a centre of excellence for british motor sport
4277677 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4277678 i knew i would be cleared because i had done nothing wrong but it was a difficult time
4277679 there were various stories in newspapers and we were unable to say anything in response family and friends were clearly concerned but there came a time when i had to turn my phone off for a couple of days so i could focus on the second test it is now time to draw a line under that matter and concentrate on the rugby but it has made me stronger
4277680 they were led by the players even if it is something that has to be driven by the coaches
4277681 what the squad went through in new zealand cannot happen again the players are aware of that and we have talked about responsibility
4277682 what happened doesnt reflect the calibre of the people in the squad but its done now and we have to deal with it weve had a couple of really good meetings thats part of the process of being a team and everyone is keen to make amends four days and two meetings will not put everything right it is an everyday process its all about being successful and we dont want the headlines weve had this year on a couple of occasions that makes it difficult for us to operate were not doing this to appease the media were doing it because we think its the right way to be a successful team
4277683 while it was a difficult tour it was also a source of pride because i won my first two england caps
4277684 i started last season third in line at harlequins and getting injured on the opening weekend so to finish it by playing against one of the best teams in the world was memorable even if the results were not i was pleased with parts of my game but i clearly have lots to work on and i have been doing that with the coaches in training this week martin johnson commands unqualified respect and it is clear that we are under a new regime
4277685 i think games will become more open and there should be more opportunities for scrum halves to make breaks
4277686 i have done a lot of work with brian smith the england backs coach on my running kicking and passing i am going to find myself in the outside half channel a lot more often and i expect a lot more counter attacking rugby from teams
4277687 i am aware that it is going to be tough to hold on to the england jersey and i need to play well for harlequins i want to play for my country as many times as i can and be part of a successful team we learned a lot in new zealand on and off the field and there were positives to take from the trip we are all looking forward now and this is going to be a massive year for me i cant wait
4277688 i am not going to give much away ahead of the november internationals but we will reflect the talent we have in the squad
4277689 a problem teams can have in unsuccessful times is churn and burn when they react to defeats by changing the cattle we have picked 32 players and we are right behind them it is important that they all have clarity about the way we want to play we have a mix of world class players and others who are not the finished article what is essential is that we go into games with plan a and b so that players have something to fall back on if things go wrong they will have freedom but we will provide the framework and the new laws will open up attacking opportunities from scrums
4277690 i couldnt get to sleep until gone 3am on sunday i was just lying there thinking i had the medal next to me i just couldnt sleep i was so happy the first feeling that i had when i woke up was im an olympic champion it was so crazy i didnt think what time is it how do i feel oh its dark its light it was just oooh and the happiness all started again it was really incredible
4277691 i thought he was the only person who could relate to the situation i was in andy said first of all you are my friend whether you ride or not dont ever think you have to be a cyclist which had been exactly what my parents said then he said lets try to fix it step by step and there was also the support i got from british cycling it couldnt have been better because they were giving me their full confidence to plan my season around the olympics
4277692 it was really tough not to do the worlds and then try to get back from the injury but they said take your time its only the olympics that count just think about getting it right to have that security from the british federation and the halfords team the way they were fully supportive in the build up to our one goal meant i could just take the time that was needed having that set up was the best option for this year because of the whole lack of pressure
4277693 i knew i still needed to get back on track i asked the british team if i could go away and train and they said do what you think is best again that was them showing confidence in me and in me believing in doing the right thing
4277694 he works on facts and logic he has a lot of experience hes been very good
4277695 we just did another test we saw how it compared how the levels had changed just tweaked the training to that and then continued with the same it was quality work a case of working at the levels i needed and getting good recovery
4277696 at races like the world championships there was always a question what if at the back of my mind because single handedly i couldnt deal with everything
4277697 probably getting towards the top of the climb if our break had not started to go away id probably have made my move then
4277698 go and savour it with the people who really helped me such as my coach
4277699 its a dream come true here and to have a chance to do it all over again is fantastic
4277700 its about understanding how to use the web to get your message out there and get your supporters to distribute it for you
4277701 this is the home page this is where were greeting people
4277702 do you think these guys could make eye contact with us no
4277703 hes using lots of different type faces at all different sizes which gives you a feeling of chaos
4277704 obamas then goes on to do what mccains doesnt which is to provide his supporters this whole infrastructure to organize themselves to do things that are going to help get obama elected and mccains just doesnt do that
4277705 it allows everybody who wants to do something to put their thing out there and see if people get excited about it
4277706 building communities online takes time and building strong robust web sites also takes time so its kind of like getting a 747 to take off from a small regional airport there aint enough runway

4277711 when i first came into the league the nfc east was the best division in football
4277712 the giants won the super bowl in 1990 the redskins won it in 1991 then we won it in 1992 and 1993 jimmie johnson used to say if you can take care of the division the rest will take care of itself we knew those would be our toughest games of the year playing the giants and redskins coming into the vet to play the eagles here and i think thats true now too if you win the nfc east this year you have a real good shot to get to the super bowl the division is just really strong right now
4277713 i think youll see three teams from the division go to the playoffs again but i think washington will be the odd man out this year
4277714 the afc south is going to be very very good with indianapolis jacksonville and tennessee and houston but you can certainly make a case that the nfc east is the best division in football

4277723 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected

4277745 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4277746 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4277747 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town

4277752 i majored in art at university and studied music theory acoustics and dtm desktop music but i was more into making original songs and playing them in a band i actually started dtm around that time which was a foundation of what i do now looking back i have been doing this in my own way with little study

4277760 big brother is massive for these titles and it just hasnt been a water cooler conversation topic this time round
4277761 that will have had a significant impact on sales consumers may have also realised that these magazines are very similar in content it could be that the same number of consumers are now buying less titles the sector has simply peaked
4277762 the magazine market is very unstable and it would come as no surprise if tough economic conditions were to blame
4277763 there is a real generational change going on at the moment and many young consumers are using websites for their gossip
4277764 these sites are updated several times a day and are free consumers may not see any point in buying a copy of heat or hello at the end of the week
4277765 although circulation is falling it has to be remembered that in most cases they are falling from a very high starting point as they have had a lot of early success
4277766 i think the celebrity magazine market is suffering from a credibility problem readers are beginning to realise that so much of what is in them is fiction which lessens the excitement of buying them celebrity culture is not on the wane though you only have to look at the number of people who queue up at auditions of reality tv shows in the hope of becoming celebrities themselves
4277767 were here to let the industry know that consumers dont want tracking devices in their clothing
4277768 when they embed rfid into clothing or shoes or other items people wear or carry they can also put the readers to pick up those signals into floors doorways ceiling tiles anywhere people go and use them to track and identify people
4277769 you cant put your clothing in the microwave to kill these chips because it could catch fire
4277770 all of those retailers all they care about is making sure they have the right products at the right time and actually saving money
4277771 the introduction of these new offences is the latest step to tackle bad driving where carelessness causes a death it is right that the driver should face tough penalties
4277772 the standards between what is deemed dangerous driving and careless arent well defined
4277773 this is a seriously bad idea the problem here is that the energy regulator ofgem has identified the fact that the energy companies are benefiting to the tune of about 10bn over five years from being allocated free permits under the european trading scheme it is a windfall to those companies
4277774 the underlying problem is that poor families pay much more for their power than better off families if youre on meter the charges are much higher than on direct debit they also live in badly insulated homes the programme has to target those problems rather than flows of income

4277776 we anticipate that situations in which fingerprint image quality is so poor that it is unusable will be extremely rare even in the 75 plus age group print quality is normally perfectly usable
4277777 on the very rare occasions when a fingerprint image falls below the quality required for automated matching it is passed to a fingerprint expert who carries out the coding manually so it can be stored on the database

4277784 the assassinations are back especially in the last two weeks just like before
4277785 two men on a motorbike have been shooting people and five barbers have been killed in the last week alone the militiamen and some of the commanders of the mahdi army are still there they dont carry weapons in public but they are still there a few months ago if you wanted to import anything through the port you had to bribe the mahdi army officials who controlled the port now the iraqi army and the government are in control so you only bribe one official now there is no work apart from collecting garbage it doesnt matter if you are an engineer or a college graduate and you have to bribe someone in the municipality to get work as a street sweeper
4277786 the mahdi army doesnt exist publicly but the killers and assassins are still there and people are still getting killed though less than before the militiamen are wearing government uniforms
4277787 the army raids remind us of what the baathists and saddams mukhabarat secret police used to do we thought that after saddam we would be living in a new iraq but the same system is back for example now the directorate of education is controlled by a new militia theyve started replacing headteachers with their own men
4277788 there is less kidnapping and killing but the militiamen are still there though they are not armed in the streets there are so many of them they cant arrest them if they did theyd have to arrest half of basra if you are a state employee then life is good but if you dont have a fixed salary then things are very hard

4277800 ma non corretto farlo con lo strumento del sequestro preventivo
4277801 la prima volta che il sequestro riguarda non solo una cosa presente ma anche una cosa futura
4277802 assurdo come se un provvedimento dicesse ti sequestro non solo la macchina che hai ma anche quelle che comprerai in futuro perch di certo le utilizzerai per commettere reati analoghi

4277805 il problema che adesso questo provvedimento potrebbe aprire le porte ad altri condotti in base allo stesso principio e con la stessa urgenza basta una denuncia e il gip pu chiedere ai provider di bloccare un indirizzo per tutta la durata del processo un ricorso pu sospendere il blocco ma comunque il sito resterebbe oscurato per almeno due settimane pu avvenire a tutti anche a un sito di notizie come repubblica it o a google che potrebbe essere denunciato da editori che si sentono lesi da google news

4277814 forecasts estimate that the countrys work force will fall by eight million over the next seven years and by up to 19 million by 2025 russian demographers said in a recent un sponsored report between 2010 and 2014 the work force will decrease by 1 3 million per year the report said in the first four months of this year the work force was down 300 000 on the same period last year the state statistics service said
4277815 this problem is greater than any other facing us over the next 10 years in reality the putin era policies were for the most part a step backward so that hasnt given much cause for hope
4277816 originally the term sentimental was used to describe poets who engage with feelings as well as the mind and if that is the way it is being used then yes burns was sentimental but in the modern sense it means treacly or sugary and that is not the real burns at all i think paxman is trying to trade off his image as a grumpy middle aged man it is very strange he is saying this its the equivalent of poking a stick in jocks ribs which is fine if he really wants to do that
4277817 who cares what he thinks of burns paxman is a short man with a long face
4277818 i am very sure that he knows he is being controversial
4277819 we knew he would say something interesting and it will certainly get people talking
4277820 its not exactly a word one hears every day but as a term to describe dog tiredness it has a pleasing euphony
4277821 although im afraid i find the scottish national poet no more than a king of sentimental doggerel one might as well have used his ramfeezled to describe our state

4277852 it is clear that there can be little public confidence in the construction of the olkiluoto 3 nuclear reactor
4277853 such a working culture is not suited for a sensitive field like this under any circumstance
4277854 nuclear is an option that any energy company that wants to be competitive in the future has to consider
4277855 but if it were 3 million per mw and 65 70 mwh theres no point

4277864 its true that i spent some time regularly taking part in sessions with a psychiatrist
4277865 by the way i find it to be very normal to lie on a couch every once in a while and to let your head be straightened out and your heart
4277866 truth is not what happened truth is what we tell people

4277878 when i was in my teens the only girls interested in dating older guy were the ones looking for financial support most girls know enough to judge guys success and resources differently depending on the guys ages
4277879 practically speaking my concern is that minors usually girls and gay boys will be taken advantage of by undesirable older people usually men but not always who would likely be rejected by people their own age
4277880 well sure some older guys could attract an 18 year old but theyre hardly the majority and need the following attractive traits
4277881 well i hardly see how the average guy is supposed to make use of this since only a fraction can make it to grad school
4277882 and on and on you are confusing 15 girls with those who are under 12 socially clueless trusting teenagers are trusting helpless etc sorry but youve completely forgotten what that life stage is like

4277904 the meaning of our existence is not invented by ourselves but rather detected
4277905 the real key to contentment and satisfaction is finding a purpose in life
4277906 the movement encourages positive world change from the inside out rather than from the outside in in my experience thats the only lasting route to positive global change
4277907 that scientific studies are showing the personal benefits of finding ones life purpose should be all the impetus needed to encourage millions of people to commit to finding their lives purpose

4277924 a lot of playing the position is you see something
4277925 hes always had a good feel for solving problems he might not be able to put it in our terminology but he knows ive got a problem over there and im going to bail myself out over here thats where he and the players have started to develop a really good feel for signals and things like that when youre dealing with a smart guy who has played as much as he has theres really not much he hasnt seen

4277953 you have an individual that is a user or manipulator of other people and im thinking particularly in terms of where youre planning the robbery for two weeks
4277954 surely you would have thought in terms of using a mask or a disguise where you wouldnt have to kill somebody so this was a deliberate and intentional act in terms of the clerk that was going to be killed
4277955 when the law punishes by death it risks its own sudden descent into brutality transgressing the constitutional commitment to decency and restraint

4277967 as soon as we started talking about making a commitment to green i had people from lots of different departments come to me and tell me why they wanted to help
4277968 so sure theres obviously consumer demand for green but that is because people everywhere are beginning to care about the environment in a whole new way including the employees of topco sales

4278377 our problem is to keep these interactions to a manageable point
4278378 its obviously a male we looked at a very very large primate male it doesnt fit into any of the taxonomic groups i can think of
4278379 unbelievable im still shaking ive never seen anything like this before
4278380 im just tired of all the stalkers so i had my brother dr van buren come down im just glad you all had something to do on the weekend
4278381 its smelling to high heaven like a hoax they can claim to have dna but its not going to be possible for them to prove through dna analysis that they have bigfoot because theres no specimen in a jar that says this is bigfoot to match it to
4278382 and the video itll be whats known in the bigfoot research community as a blobsquatch an indeterminate dark blob that may or may not be a man a bear a bigfoot an elf a dragon who knows
4278383 ive had interactions with tom biscardi a well known bigfoot hunter who is holding the press conference in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
4278384 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4278385 we have geared up resources and will have anti air attack systems in place in the capital some areas have been declared no fly zones

4278389 its one of those opportunities where girls and guys can dress up together
4278390 the complexity of newly engineered systems coupled with their potential impact on lives the environment etc raise a set of ethical issues that engineers had not been thinking about
4278391 our saving grace our inability to affect things at a planetary level is being lost to us
4278392 we need at least to think about what we are doing while we are doing it to be aware of the consequences of our research
4278393 it leaves the door open for people to do something that is going to cause long term problems
4278394 the question now is how best to begin that discussion among the scientists to encourage them to do something like this then figure out what would be the right mechanism who would fund it what form would recommendations take all those details
4278395 scientists and engineers should not be involved in these kinds of ethical questions
4278396 even beginning the discussion putting geoengineering on the table and beginning the scientific work could in itself make us less concerned about all the things that we need to start doing now
4278397 maladapted for situations that call for focused research to resolve societal issues that need to be faced with some urgency
4278398 the sooner there is an opportunity for public discussion the better
4278399 not well designed to handle issues that are not already in a crisis
4278400 with no grand debate over first principles and no accusations of acting in bad faith nanotechnology has received only fitful attention
4278401 to understand the consequences of our inventions while we are in the rapture of discovery
4278402 we have yet to come to terms with the fact that the most compelling 21st century technologies robotics genetic engineering and nanotechnology pose a different threat than the technologies that have come before they are so powerful they can spawn whole new classes of accidents and abuses
4278403 dedicated scientists and doctors may pursue research that some members of society find repugnant
4278404 to have a broad understanding of science and an appreciation of its potential for good
4278405 modes of knowing that are often pushed aside in expanding scientific understanding and technological capacity
4278406 do we recognize when we might be putting ourselves on a negative technological treadmill by moving in one direction rather than another
4278407 there are social questions we should be paying attention to that we should see as important
4278408 we treat each and every detainee in our custody with the same high level of quality professional care possible
4278409 after almost two weeks of suffering with unbearable back pain and unable to get any sleep he was so weak and looked horrible
4278410 he said i told the nursing department im in pain but they dont believe me
4278411 because he could no longer withstand the suffering inside the facility
4278412 they outright said if you vote for barack obama this law is going to pass your wages would go down you could lose your job
4278413 our policies are clear and we have communicated to our associates that if anyone representing our company gave the impression they were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and were acting without approval
4278414 i think theres a perception these compounds hold untapped potential to help us understand the human mind
4278415 the working hypothesis is that if psilocybin or lsd can occasion these experiences of great personal meaning and spiritual significance then it would allow patients with terminal illnesses hopefully to face their own demise completely differently to restructure some of the psychological angst that so often occurs concurrently with severe disease
4278416 pamela had lost hope she wasnt able to make plans for the future she wasnt able to engage the day as if she had a future left
4278417 investigators need to be confident that the volunteer could not exit the window if in a delusional state
4278418 the way i view it is we experienced some kind of broad cultural trauma back in the 60s and these drugs became demonised in that context
4278419 as a culture we just decided clinical research shouldnt be done with this class of compounds
4278420 this was partly the federal regulatory authorities it was partly the funding agencies and it was partly the academics themselves leary had so discredited a scientific approach to studying these compounds that anyone who expressed an interest in doing so was automatically discredited
4278421 these drugs these experiences are not for the mystic who wants to sit on the mountain top and meditate they are not for the counter culture rebel they are for everybody
4278422 they expressly authorize the fbi to engage in intelligence collection inside the united states
4278423 there was clear eyed and bipartisan recognition after the attacks that we needed to be able and allowed to collect intelligence in the united states
4278424 under the new guidelines the investigative steps that the fbi may take in a particular investigation will not be driven by irrelevant factors such as the type of paperwork the agent uses to open the investigation
4278425 im concerned with the way the attorney general frames the problem
4278426 he talks about arbitrary or irrelevant differences between criminal and national security investigations but these were corrections originally designed to prevent the type of overreach the fbi engaged in for years
4278427 nobodys complaining about the fbi collecting domestic intelligence when its appropriate and authorized under the law
4278428 what the attorney general is doing is expanding the bureaus intelligence collection without addressing the mismanagement within the fbi if you have an agency collecting more with less oversight its only going to get worse
4278429 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
4278430 at the heart of liberty is the right to define ones own concept of existence of meaning of the universe and of the mystery of human life
4278431 respect for human life finds an ultimate expression in the bond of love the mother has for her child it seems unexceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained severe depression and loss of esteem can follow
4278432 we feel at the moment a greater concern for our safety
4278433 thats why every installation of the western world on the polish territory has its meaning because it anchors poland more deeply to the west
4278434 it seems that the americans have changed their view due to the situation in the caucasus
4278435 in the eyes of washington this conflict has proved that russia isnt a stable partner and continues to consider its international surroundings as its exclusive sphere of influence
4278436 with russian tanks rolling into georgia theres a feeling among former eastern bloc states that the tanks could roll over their borders too theres a certain urgency now
4278437 our arguments about the need for a permanent presence of us troops and missiles on polish soil have been taken seriously by the american side
4278438 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
4278439 i understand this will be tourist style accommodation a managed system whereby people can own one of the units but it will also be managed by the central manager of the who will be able to lease that out on occasion as well

4278442 this is a serious enough matter for david bartlett to have engaged in one of the biggest political backflips

4278445 the rock critic seeking janis joplin watches a big brother and holding company clip from the 1967 monterey pop festival she listens to the headstrong voice spiral and thrust shes heard it before what she sees for the first time is a foot encased in a delicate white sandal slamming into the stage like a headboard into a bedroom wall she catches her breath and realizes suddenly that everything she knows about janis joplin could be complete crap every fact about her every image every song and film sequence has been processed and shaped and spindled and manipulated by someone who was not janis joplin everything she has imagined about janis joplin is someone elses story she thinks and wonders whether that was also true back in the sixties for people who did get to witness janis joplin live

4278495 portsmouth football club strongly deny charges by the fa alleging a breach of their regulations concerning the transfer of benjani mwaruwari to and from the club
4278496 we did not pay an agent when benjani joined the club from auxerre in january 2006 and his transfer to manchester city in january this year was approved at the time by the premier league and the fas compliance unit
4278497 this is nothing more than a technicality which we will strongly contest
4278498 our customers are telling us their main summer holiday is sancrosanct we see no evidence that consumers are trading down or curtailing their holiday plans there has been no deterioration in cancellation rates or lengths of stay
4278499 whether that continues i dont know but what we are not seeing is trading down
4278500 what if you could make the ordinary amp the mundane
4278501 i was shocked to when i read this recent article in
4278502 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4278503 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4278504 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4278505 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4278506 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4278507 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4278508 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4278509 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4278510 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4278511 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4278512 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4278513 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4278514 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4278515 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4278516 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4278517 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4278518 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4278519 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4278520 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4278521 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4278522 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4278523 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4278524 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4278525 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4278526 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4278527 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4278528 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
4278529 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4278530 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4278531 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4278532 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4278533 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4278534 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4278535 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4278536 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4278537 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4278538 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4278539 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4278540 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4278541 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4278542 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4278543 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4278544 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4278545 so here are my initial thoughts summed up dark elves so far are a wonderfully fun race set in a creatively crafted mmo with some rough edges a whole lot of whats been promised is there though public quests smart kill quests cleverly entertaining quests the tome of knowledge open world rvr and engaging scenarios within the first five or eight levels youre going to see and experience all of these things thankfully theres still more for me and you to experience i havent yet gotten to experience living guilds city raids high level rvr and or high level public quests lets not forget the other two destruction factions either so consider this a tentative thumbs up and watch massively over the next week or two for plenty more discussion on the game
4278546 non financial assets form the greater part of world wealth and have been more stable in value during periods of financial and social turbulence
4278547 theres no doubt theres further deterioration in the cards for bank earnings and well continue to see financial sector woes play themselves out
4278548 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4278549 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4278550 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4278551 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4278552 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4278553 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4278554 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4278555 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4278556 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4278557 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4278558 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4278559 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4278560 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4278561 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4278562 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4278563 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4278564 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4278565 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4278566 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4278567 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
4278568 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
4278569 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
4278570 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4278571 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4278572 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4278573 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4278574 the next time you attend an outdoor festival to watch a musical performance or a livestock show someone could be watching you too the city of milwaukee is joining with five surrounding counties to purchase a network of portable video surveillance cameras for monitoring crowds at large public events
4278575 if it rains too hard theyll say its because people arent required to show their drivers licenses when they vote
4278576 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4278577 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4278578 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4278579 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4278580 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4278581 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4278582 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4278583 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4278584 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
4278585 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4278586 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4278587 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4278588 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4278589 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4278590 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4278591 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4278592 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4278593 we must lower gas prices and a chicken in every pot for every voting american
4278594 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4278595 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4278596 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4278597 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4278598 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4278599 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4278600 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4278601 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4278602 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4278603 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4278604 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4278605 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4278606 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4278607 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4278608 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4278609 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4278610 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4278611 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4278612 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4278613 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4278614 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4278615 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4278616 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4278617 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4278618 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
4278619 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4278620 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
4278621 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
4278622 these are all small things and they all add up
4278623 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
4278624 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
4278625 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
4278626 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4278627 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4278628 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4278629 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4278630 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4278631 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4278632 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4278633 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4278634 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4278635 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4278636 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4278637 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4278638 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4278639 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4278640 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4278641 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4278642 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4278643 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4278644 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4278645 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4278646 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
4278647 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
4278648 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
4278649 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
4278650 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
4278651 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
4278652 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
4278653 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4278654 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
4278655 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4278656 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4278657 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4278658 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4278659 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4278660 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4278661 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4278662 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4278663 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4278664 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4278665 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4278666 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4278667 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4278668 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4278669 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4278670 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4278671 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4278672 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4278673 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4278674 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4278675 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4278676 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4278677 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4278678 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4278679 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4278680 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4278681 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4278682 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4278683 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4278684 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4278685 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4278686 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4278687 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4278688 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4278689 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4278690 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4278691 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4278692 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4278693 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4278694 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4278695 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4278696 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4278697 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4278698 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4278699 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4278700 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
4278701 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
4278702 mouse skin is different from human skin but the research could help to explain the incidence of some types of skin cancer
4278703 extrapolation between the species for this aspect of biology is simply not warranted many agents that cause skin cancer in mice do not do so in man indeed some of these agents are used as therapies it seems extraordinarily unlikely that the results have any clinical relevance
4278704 if the theory that applying moisturisers increased the risk of non melanoma skin cancers were correct you would expect to see more of these cancers in women and on their faces
4278705 this is not the case so while the research is interesting i dont think any conclusions should be drawn from it at this stage and it should not put people off using skin creams if they wish to do so
4278706 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
4278707 i saw hearts that had been taken from live people
4278708 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
4278709 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
4278710 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
4278711 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
4278712 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
4278713 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4278714 some young men even bought the t shirts for 60 shekel 17 29 which is a lot to spend in gaza on a t shirt but that is how much gazans like obama
4278715 the left and their handmaidens the mani stream media were so quick to deflect this hit it seems we have hit a raw nerve
4278716 we have to move faster and probably need to be more aggressive
4278717 in terms of the standard report card financials customer satisfaction integration with the rest of cisco id give them very high marks versus what was realistic to expect but we do need to move faster and as we move faster were often doing it in areas where we do not have as much experience so attracting everything from saas partners like sap oracle and salesforce or attracting a new community of users that havent traditionally thought of cisco for that is an area we probably need to be more aggressive in
4278718 and when you move into a new market adjacency youve got to bring in some people who already understand it
4278719 the key issue there for us is prioritization there are so many opportunities for us to go after with just webex alone never mind the other two dozen cross functional priorities were going after in fact one of the things this year for the first time were doing is budgeting for every new area we move into for the implications on every other group not just engineering but think about sales marketing services etc we look at the interdependencies much earlier on you quickly realize there are many more costs than just the engineering or the initial pilot approaches so prioritization from a cost and sequencing perspective is very key
4278720 weve got some good ideas here but id say weve got a ways to go before things are set in concrete in terms of our prioritization and our strategy
4278721 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4278722 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4278723 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4278724 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4278725 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4278726 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4278727 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4278728 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4278729 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4278730 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4278731 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4278732 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4278733 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4278734 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4278735 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4278736 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4278737 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4278738 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4278739 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4278740 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4278741 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4278742 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4278743 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4278744 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4278745 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4278746 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4278747 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4278748 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4278749 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4278750 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4278751 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4278752 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4278753 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4278754 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4278755 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4278756 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4278757 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4278758 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4278759 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4278760 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4278761 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4278762 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4278763 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4278764 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4278765 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4278766 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4278767 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4278768 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4278769 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4278770 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4278771 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4278772 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4278773 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4278774 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4278775 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4278776 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4278777 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4278778 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4278779 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4278780 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4278781 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4278782 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4278783 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4278784 who are open to doing something on the production side
4278785 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4278786 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4278787 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4278788 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4278789 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4278790 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4278791 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4278792 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
4278793 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
4278794 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
4278795 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
4278796 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4278797 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4278798 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4278799 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4278800 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4278801 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4278802 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4278803 just so you all know we did set a record
4278804 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4278805 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4278806 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4278807 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4278808 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4278809 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4278810 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4278811 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4278812 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4278813 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4278814 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4278815 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4278816 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4278817 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4278818 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4278819 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4278820 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4278821 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4278822 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4278823 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4278824 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4278825 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4278826 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4278827 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4278828 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4278829 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4278830 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4278831 youve got to be careful off the tee to hit the fairways thats going to be the key all week
4278832 i got off to a great start and made tons of putts
4278833 i missed a few opportunities on the second nine but i made a birdie to finish on a high note so im very pleased
4278834 i cant remember the last time i had 10 putts on nine holes
4278835 i saw hearts that had been taken from live people
4278836 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4278837 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4278838 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4278839 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4278840 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4278841 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4278842 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4278843 get some calories into my system and try to recover the best i can
4278844 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4278845 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4278846 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
4278847 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
4278848 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
4278849 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
4278850 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
4278851 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4278852 our position on georgias territorial integrity is not going to change no matter what anybody says and so i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia we will ignore it
4278853 the economy is screwed we spend too much money and our foreign policy is insane
4278854 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4278855 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4278856 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4278857 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4278858 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4278859 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4278860 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4278861 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4278862 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4278863 we are so excited to finally get spore into the hands of fans and players the maxis studio has had an absolute blast creating spore but the fun is just beginning the most engaging stories are truly the ones people create themselves and we cant wait to see how players not only craft and explore the spore universe but hear what stories they have to tell as a result

4278866 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4278867 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4278868 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4278869 we dont have a weakness but if a team comes out and plays better than us or if we dont come out and play like we know how to play then we can lose
4278870 hr didnt want to attend events to begin with it unfortunate that he doesnt wish to keep playing but ggw will continue to make events should we please our sponser a big hit yes the end of the world no sirs i do believe boston will be hrs last event with us its been a good run gentlemen best of luck to him and his rl en devours and hopefully hell continue to play wow with or without a team
4278871 in the latest wotlk beta push we made a large change to the mana cost of spells all player spells now cost a percentage of base mana rather than a fixed cost base mana is a special value determined by the players level and class regardless of any effects or items that increase intellect it is the size of a players mana pool if the player has zero intellect
4278872 you can bet if they dont mind my open obscenity its because theyre used to similar gross out levels from their bathroom mirror

4278875 i rolled on barthilas for you and you clearly dont even care about alesia referring to her character lmao or you would have consulted me before giving soj your opinion about the guild
4278876 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4278877 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4278878 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4278879 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4278880 mark penn the top campaign strategist for hillary rodham clintons campaign advised her to portray barack obama as having a

4278882 i am going to vomit who gave you the right to destroy the constitution and take impeachment off the table our

4278886 well then please please impeach them for the constitution your constituents and your conscience
4278887 a new book by the author ron suskind claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein
4278888 by design those attacks put the american population into a state of intense fear of islamic terrorism far more than the 9 11 attacks alone could have accomplished
4278889 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
4278890 if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come to believe it the lie can be maintained only for such time as the state can shield the people from the political economic and or military consequences of the lie it thus becomes vitally important for the state to use all of its powers to repress dissent for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie and thus by extension the truth is the greatest enemy of the state
4278891 the most brilliant propagandist technique will yield no success unless one fundamental principle is borne in mind constantly it must confine itself to a few points and repeat them over and over
4278892 this is not intended to be a mere discussion of violations of law that have occurred
4278893 it is rather intended to be a planning conference at which plans will be laid and necessary organizational structures set up
4278894 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime

4278896 when she heard that i had this audition for that she told me you know what
4278897 they told me that these characters might get involved with each other and get some relationship going on there
4278898 then when i watched the past seasons i realized how open it was
4278899 im kind of used to it because every film ive done before im always making love to a beautiful woman or running around naked
4278900 its really deeper than we know and deeper than we get to know
4278901 its hard all i can say is they still have the best doctors working for no money and they still have great athletes take my word for this theyre going to get more medals from beijing than mexico and mexico is a quote unquote democracy
4278902 its fine with me because i think george clooney is one of the greatest actors
4278903 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4278904 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4278905 like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of

4278917 you dont respond to emails your voice mail is full the website is not updated and you release no statements to let teachers know where we are in this negotiations process
4278918 pardon my ignorance but why is the chancellor able to e mail me back with a multiple sentence response but george parker cannot send a one word reply
4278919 the numbers have just made it impossible to respond in a timely manner and carry on the day to day operations of the union
4278920 we never even considered the possibility they would do it before we asked
4278921 they certainly decided it was important enough on their own
4278922 utter deference to the executive to decide what it wanted and to do what it wanted and to violate the law

4278939 hes one of the best bass players weve got in this business and to finally see him get recognition after standing behind for all these years is just wonderful
4278940 its always an honor to get nominated and its always a surprise too
4278941 you know theres a lot of young bands out there that are really entertaining the people these days id rather one of them would win it because theyre great but i still love talking to people on stage and we do requests from the audience all the time i figure they pay to get in to see you so you need to do what they want you to do

4278977 when the opportunity came up to take our electric guitars and make some unholy noise to try to stop a war it sounded familiar to me
4278978 its something we did 40 years ago as part of a generation that said the war in vietnam was wrong and needed to stop were part of a generation saying the war in iraq is wrong and needs to stop

4278986 sorry network creators cannot change their passwords through networks they dont own

4278999 unfortunately our autistic daughter whos doing very well shes been diagnosed with very very severe autism is adopted from china and so she would have had all her vaccines in china before we got her and then she had most of her vaccines given to her in the united states before we got her
4279000 almost every amish family i know has had somebody from the health department knock on our door and try to convince us to get vaccines for our children
4279001 the younger amish more and more are getting vaccines its a minority of children who vaccinate but that is changing now
4279002 one of them were very certain it was a vaccine reaction even though the government would not agree with that
4279003 the other one im not sure if this child was vaccinated or not
4279004 theres one family that we know their daughter had a vaccine reaction and is now autistic

4279006 my husband just said last week that so far weve never met a family that lives a healthy lifestyle and does not vaccinate their children that has an autistic child we havent come across one yet
4279007 everywhere i go outside the amish community i find children who are autistic just because i have an autistic daughter in the grocery store in the park wherever i go in the amish community i simply dont find that

4279012 ordinary japanese dont have a strong sense of protecting the right to their image we havent talked enough about how to protect the rights of people who dont even own a pc
4279013 after all its all about the balance between googles right to do business and the right to personal privacy if the government regulates google will other media have to be regulated
4279014 if you think of human rights obviously it is better without street view
4279015 id lost to him eight nine 10 50 times i dont know how many but i had the feeling it could be my day

4279031 by waiting until 2011 to start looking for tenants a year before we finish the project we will be further into the recovery and should get higher rates
4279032 57 000 square metres of the highest quality office space
4279033 today you would never start such a big project without a tenant already lined up the economics are not attractive enough
4279034 its already happening but in a less public way than with leadenhall street
4279035 by the first quarter of 2012 we hope it will be done and dusted
4279036 if the economy is to grow then employment needs to grow so we need to create more space for people to work
4279037 if we dont want to build on green fields then we need to get more people into the same space and that means taller buildings
4279038 we continue to believe the relief rally following barratts refinancing deal has been overdone and that we will see share price weakness in the lead up to the reporting season
4279039 we have thrown more money at that do we let go of the client or subsidise over the last two months we have decided to keep volume going i can either take a decision to say goodbye because this is a fast moving site or say what about splitting the difference its a new phenomenon
4279040 the government wants to expand social housing and is putting in money through the housing corporation
4279041 we are keeping hold of the pounds as hard as we can getting the company in such a position that when things pick up we are fit and healthy
4279042 as we get into the fourth quarter of this year many people will re set their it budgets for 2009 and we do not know what they will do if they do decide to set them lower then we will see some slowdown
4279043 i still remain of the view that europe as a whole will deliver low gdp growth zero 1 or 2 that sort of level and the it services business will grow at a few percentage points above that the big players like ourselves will do better than the smaller players
4279044 this is a solid statement from logica showing that the operational performance has remained strong despite the major changes as part of the strategic plan

4279057 this is a seriously bad idea the problem here is that the energy regulator ofgem has identified the fact that the energy companies are benefiting to the tune of about 10bn over five years from being allocated free permits under the european trading scheme it is a windfall to those companies
4279058 the underlying problem is that poor families pay much more for their power than better off families if youre on meter the charges are much higher than on direct debit they also live in badly insulated homes the programme has to target those problems rather than flows of income

4279078 during the quarter we grew sales and more importantly gross margin in the photovoltaic segment of the business additionally we made investments to increase our manufacturing capacity of our own solar modules the diversification of our sales channel to include direct sales to international customers has allowed us to balance sales with factory output
4279079 we remain on track and on target as we enter the second half of the year our pipeline of business opportunities remains strong and our supply position relative to high quality cells for our modules should allow us to meet these targets
4279080 we continue to expand our residential customer base complete our u s book of commercial business and capitalize on our direct panel sales moreover our brand strength and vertical integration strategy coupled with our yes solar solutions franchise provides multiple avenues for rapid growth in the coming years
4279081 today we take another enormous step forward in our goal of establishing the hudson valley and all of new york as a national and international hub for solar research and development i am especially pleased that solar thin films uses amorphous silicon since it is the most well developed thin film technology to date and has a promising avenue of further development solar thin films is playing a critical role in the steady advancement of solar technology by increasing the efficiency of solar products and lowering their costs i am excited to welcome into the solar energy consortium solar thin films a firm dedicated to making solar technology more mainstream across the county state and country
4279082 tsec is to be complimented in making solar thin films aware of the enormous potential available in ulster county as the company pursues its goal to be a leading provider of amorphous silicon solar modules
4279083 tsec and the ulster county development corporation have assisted solar thin films in finding an appropriate factory site have assisted us in satisfying our financial needs and have been instrumental in forging potential power partnerships with local utilities these steps will be instrumental in protecting the environment reducing our need and utilization of oil and significantly alter the rate of the energy cost spiral we hope to be a major employer in the county and more importantly a very good neighbor

4279087 as a result of recent events in georgia we have formally taken a decision not to do that not to participate in an operation that was known as vigilant eagle which would have involved canadian american and russian forces
4279088 it would be clearly inappropriate under the circumstances based on russias breach of territorial integrity in georgia
4279089 based on that type of aggressive behaviour we will not participate in the exercise
4279090 i hope it is a message that says the world is noticing your actions
4279091 this would have been a historic level of co operation militarily in my view
4279092 i dont want to put a time frame on how far we have stepped back but clearly this is a freeze on this type of progress with russia
4279093 we are looking for ways that lower the temperature on what was a very serious breach of sovereignty and territorial integrity in georgia

4279098 on barclays credit market exposures we believe there is the potential for up to 4 6bn of further write downs these are spread across the whole credit portfolio but some may take longer to crystallise as they sit within the loan book we forecast 1 5 bn further write downs over the next 18 months as we believe exposures could move closer to other marks in the market
4279099 the trade press has reported a soft cost cutting exercise at johnston in recent days and mooted various title closures

4279101 the new management team are still confident of recovery at rentokil but clearly the starting base looks to be lower than originally expected with the problems inherited from the previous management being compounded by a weakening economic background
4279102 autonomy should join the top companies club the ftse 100 from september 10 ahead of this we expect the company to maintain its usual heady pace of customer announcements with the share headed for ftse status and the resultant index buying that will incur we are upping our recommendation from hold to buy
4279103 the government is confident it is doing the right thing for the interests of ghana
4279104 its unlike anything weve seen in the trading card category
4279105 although high levels of objective prenatal maternal stress results in less than optimal language related development exposure to moderate levels may actually enhance performance
4279106 pregnancy is already a big change and when you add another major stress even if it is not experienced as negative stress
4279107 i just jumped in it was just instinct i got hold of him and i tried to get him into a life ring twice i couldnt get him in it he was panicking
4279108 i was drifting away from the boat and he was pulling at the back of me and i was trying to pull him up and we both kind of fell apart
4279109 it was pretty choppy seas and i drifted one way and he was drifting the other we lost sight of one another
4279110 i had lost all my energy i was in for quite a while and i couldnt shout
4279111 by that time i was on to my last breath the waves were coming over the top of head and i cant remember much after that apart from landing on the deck i was numb for hours
4279112 charles almost saved him he had hold of the man but the man was struggling and panicking and a wave parted them and he was away and that was him gone
4279113 the water temperature overnight was recorded as being 14c which is reasonably warm but it gives a survival time of around six hours
4279114 this has been a sad sad time for fraserburgh i was at the fish market this morning where it was very quiet the chap who was lost may have been from the philippines but he is a local fisherman to us he was one of our own
4279115 he had been working here for more than two years and was well liked and respected he was a great lad and his death is just horrendous for the town
4279116 it looked as though the strength of the eurozone would prop up the uk economy by supporting export growth however todays news that the eurozone economy contracted by 0 2 per cent suggests that activity may not be as supportive for the uk
4279117 although the sharp decline in economic growth was widely expected the consensus forecast was minus 0 2 per cent the economic slowdown has intensified markedly in a number of european countries
4279118 the figure of 41 officially reported british rape victims so far is the worst ever in greek police records
4279119 at the present rate it is bound to break all previous records and will again give greece the unenviable record of having the largest number of british rape victims both in real figures but especially proportionately to the british tourism population
4279120 this suggests the popular image of the nation as glass half empty pessimists is outdated there appear to be much more positive feelings coming out which we can be very pleased about
4279121 one of the main things in terms of peoples happiness and contentment is social networks and community cohesion
4279122 possibly in scotland where communities are smaller than in the south of england people have more connection with family and friends
4279123 the fact the survey was done in the second half of 2007 is one measurement of the snp governments success in delivering a wealthier and fairer scotland
4279124 only this week we had figures showing unemployment falling in scotland while it rose in the uk as a whole and unemployment is now significantly lower in scotland than south of the border
4279125 it is ridiculous to suggest this is the result of a few months of snp government a more substantial claim would be to say it was due to progress in the last decade under labour
4279126 we still believe in fairness at work and the political process these questions probably played a part behind the scenes in the answers people gave and that is very very positive for scotland
4279127 i grew up in edinburgh but moved to skye 23 years ago to take over the three chimneys
4279128 we live next to the restaurant which is in the westernmost point of skye
4279129 the location is completely idyllic we can see the water out of the bedroom window it is one of the most beautiful places in the world
4279130 no matter the weather the scenery is always dramatic skye is a stunning place and i love living here
4279131 my life is exceptionally busy but i get great enjoyment out of being involved in scotlands immensely important tourist industry
4279132 this is one of the busiest weeks of the year things can be brilliant one minute and dreadful the next but its great running my own business i couldnt be a bank manager or work in a job where i am stuck in a shop all day
4279133 the credit crunch is a disaster for everyone but so far we have come off better because we are at the quality end of the tourist market
4279134 day or night no matter what time of year i love driving through scotland and seeing the rolling purple hills the scenery is so beautiful
4279135 happiness is enjoying every day of your life for what it brings and making the most of what scotland has to offer
4279136 people in scotland have a real sense of belonging which other countries dont really have the rest of the uk does have a sense of identity but i dont think they feel like they belong quite as much as we do in scotland
4279137 how satisfied are you with your life as a whole
4279138 the great tit only lays one clutch of eggs in a year it lays them early enough to hatch at the time of peak emergence of caterpillars
4279139 there is some evidence that this is now out of synch
4279140 we can be pretty confident the same will be happening to rare and declining birds
4279141 we know that this is almost certainly due to lower food availability principally sand eels
4279142 we are also aware that changes in sand eel abundance are probably linked to climate change in the seas around the scottish coastline
4279143 this years report shows that climate change is with us already and from our gardens to our seas birds are having to respond rapidly simply to survive
4279144 as often before birds are acting like the canaries in a mine shaft and giving us early warning of dangerous change
4279145 the production of grappa is part of northern italys social and cultural tradition and is carried out in the alpine regions by hundreds of families as it always has been
4279146 the aim of the bill is to bring home made grappa production out into the open and to outline a code of hygiene while safeguarding the business of authorised grappa producers
4279147 grappa production needs to adhere to strict health and safety standards you cannot allow just anyone to make it
4279148 there are rules and regulations there to protect the health of the drinker what guarantee is there that these will be followed if this bill is approved
4279149 this bill would put distilleries who make genuine grappa under threat serving home made grappa in an agriturismo is not like serving your own home produced wine or fresh produce
4279150 the advanced techniques of proper grappa distilling guarantee the safety and quality of the product who will provide the controls lets not forget that in the past our grandfathers and great grandfathers who brewed their own grappa died with their digestive organs on fire because it was badly made
4279151 this is a ridiculous idea and one that will potentially be very dangerous every year there are cases of people dying after drinking home made grappa the production of grappa must be properly controlled to ensure it is safe and to allow distilleries that make it legally and correctly to continue production
4279152 gordon has to be there he could not be more closely aligned to the seat
4279153 we should be running a positive campaign and we need good policies in place to do this
4279154 we have lost three by elections in a row largely due to the fact they were run negatively
4279155 we lost and the headlines were still gordon loses glasgow east he couldnt get any more blame than that if we lost glenrothes so he may as well turn up
4279156 i have not seriously considered this my main focus is to respect the grieving of johns family and to pay a bit of respect
4279157 we wanted to bring the game bang up to date the new characters are more in tune with modern society and with the added touch of a first name more human
4279158 the new rooms and weapons have helped to give the game a much needed face lift and with the added risk of players being killed off mid play we have definitely increased its tempo
4279159 at the centre of every social event she has the attention of all the celebrity magazines but her biggest fear is that the press will uncover the shady things she did to claw her way to the top
4279160 once sought after celebrity football player age has finally caught up with him
4279161 i suppose its like crime fiction it has to be updated as long as the puzzle element is still there there are people who love the old agatha christie style with the cheap thrill of the surprise end
4279162 i remember playing cluedo as a child and it set me off on the path of devising games and mysteries im certainly not horrified by what they have done
4279163 i strongly condemn the reign of terror let loose by the indian forces against the besieged people of kashmir
4279164 the indian government should order troops and police to refrain from using lethal force against violent protesters in jammu and kashmir unless absolutely necessary to protect life
4279165 it is all a huge setback for a political solution to kashmir
4279166 in france people whoop and boo at films in the non posh bits of american cities too
4279167 as well as your passion humour goodwill and cake could you bring a jam jar of peas to rattle or some other kind of noise making instrument
4279168 we could have sold out twice over for some films people are attracted because its so different the spirit in which its being done and the fact the programme is quite unlike anything else there seems to be a set model for film festivals and this is an attempt to step outside that repetitive model
4279169 i think there will probably be a dip in supply because a lot of people who donate are moving house
4279170 the drop in people moving will have a big impact as we get donations from people who do not want to take all their possessions with them
4279171 its astonishing the generosity of individuals and how much they think about not wasting and supporting people
4279172 mps would be more than welcome to buy from these local organisations or donate their john lewis items when they are no longer of use
4279173 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4279174 i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4279175 i dont think we are looking at a cold war in the original sense
4279176 i think this is a crisis that has been waiting to happen it was always going to be georgia
4279177 this is the us sending a clear message to the russians
4279178 its not coincidental that they signed it tonight its an upping of the ante
4279179 i think all sides will know where to draw a line to prevent further escalation
4279180 clearly it could escalate if there are flashpoints if for example there is a stand off between ukrainian
4279181 its in nobodys interest for this to escalate to a regional conflict
4279182 what happened in georgia could directly impact on ukraine if for example the political divisions in ukraine solidify and become violent in any way what this could do is set a template for russian intervention in a sovereign state
4279183 a conflict is in neither russia nor ukraines interest trade between the two has been rising at 30 per cent a year the price moves today are understandable but not really justified
4279184 unfortunately the gas deal with the russians has not yet been signed and this could make it more difficult
4279185 a sudden adjustment to market prices for gas next year would be hard for the economy to absorb
4279186 its a perfect storm for ukraine at the moment the government has made it clear that it is on a collision course with russia and there are other issues as well
4279187 the idea that you get one of these flare ups in tensions that involve military conflict that would then just die down overnight was somewhat misplaced all you can really say is that well have a kind of focus on the more medium term issues and try to see through this bout of political risk
4279188 its certainly true that the longer this goes on the bigger hit russias image is going to take in the west but at the same time there is a change of administration in washington at the end of the year and there has been a change in moscow
4279189 although putins prime minister whether you like it or not we do have a more dovish president in place now whether hes pulling the strings or not
4279190 a significant uptick in fighting is on balance unlikely given president medvedevs 12 august statement that hostilities are almost complete and the 13 august informal ceasefire
4279191 the chance of an incident is very low as the risk to both sides is obviously extremely high but some danger is created by ambiguity in the terms of the ceasefire and by the chance that a separatist could try to trigger an incident

4279193 they were travelling in white toyota land cruisers that were clearly marked as irc vehicles as humanitarian vehicles their policy was never to travel with weapons in the car so there wouldnt be any doubt that theyre a peaceful humanitarian organisation
4279194 wayne was a much loved son grandson brother and uncle who served his country with distinction and sadly paid the ultimate price he was our true hero
4279195 she was not a naive or reckless person she was always respectful to local customs and very attentive when listening to peoples views we are all in a complete state of shock
4279196 a new model for cancer care is required that addresses the whole experience of the patient we have to treat the person as well as the disease
4279197 as well as making sure people in scotland can have the best medical management for cancer we must also provide support for the social and psychological issues people with cancer have identified as important
4279198 this report reflects what people affected by cancer have been telling us for some time
4279199 a cancer diagnosis does not just affect people medically but can have a huge impact on the whole of someones life
4279200 the scottish government has a great opportunity through its new cancer strategy to ensure everyone affected by cancer receives the medical physical practical financial and emotional support they need to deal with the full impact of a diagnosis
4279201 work is under way on updating the scottish cancer plan which is expected to focus on all aspects of qualitative care for people with cancer
4279202 the crown office and procurator fiscal service recognises the devastating effect road traffic offences which cause the death of another person have on the friends and families of victims
4279203 these offences are investigated with the highest priority i have decided there will be a presumption that the new offences will be prosecuted before a jury this reflects the seriousness of the offences and the fact the maximum sentence can be imposed by a sheriff
4279204 it seems quite tough but people who plead guilty will get one third off and will serve only half the sentence so the time behind bars is likely to be months rather than years
4279205 the fringe has already had one crisis with the box office situation this year and if we lose the assembly rooms the council will precipitate another one
4279206 were already looking for an alternative building but to be honest there just isnt one suitable enough
4279207 we gave assembly theatre three years notice of these refurbishments and if they decide they dont want to use the renovated venue in 2012 then we would open it up to other operators
4279208 bill should stop claiming the end of the world is nigh we wouldnt lose any sleep if he doesnt want to use the venue again but id be amazed if that is really the case
4279209 we plan to invest heavily in the assembly rooms to make it a hive of activity all year round the festival season will continue to be very important but we need to look at the long term future for edinburghs venues
4279210 i feel it necessary to clarify my position i personally brought to the attention of the standards commission information regarding comments i had supposedly made and the subsequent confidential council reports that were leaked to the press
4279211 i requested that the standards commission review the information and my comments
4279212 i decided to make this submission to the standards commission myself because i felt that given the circumstances and nature of the issue it would be the most appropriate place to have a fair and balanced hearing
4279213 as with all submissions to the standards commission it would be highly inappropriate for me to make any further comment particularly in relation to the content of my submission and the surrounding circumstances

4279260 these are all wonderful things im sure but no one here is asking the question how will we pay for all of this
4279261 if we do these things on credit which is what we usually do who pays for it your children your grandchildren
4279262 look in the sky faster than a speeding spending bill racing through congress more powerful than an entitlement mentality able to leap over tall taxes in a single bound its a bird its a plane its pay as you go guy and he is saving our children and our grandchildren

4279284 interpersonal relationships with students and faculty from many world regions
4279285 we have a comprehensive program that encompasses all areas of fish and wildlife conservation from conservation of endangered species to management of game species
4279286 virtually all of the subdisciplines of fisheries and wildlife are addressed by our faculty including conservation ecology population dynamics behavior habitat modeling physiology and toxicology and human dimensions and policy
4279287 many of our graduate students work with more than one major adviser and because of our comprehensive program they get broad exposure to the many aspects of wildlife conservation
4279288 we aim to turn out the best young professionals that we can and our students recruit into good positions in the united states and abroad
4279289 bring back to their home countries and institutions a model of how the profession of fisheries and wildlife conservation is practiced
4279290 helps if the student has some connections with a conservation organization in his her home country that could lead to a research question that needs to be addressed there we are committed to helping wildlife conservation organizations in other countries upgrade the knowledge and skills of their professionals and we prefer to see international students work on problems in their home countries and to return to their home countries when they finish their graduate work so their countries can benefit from the experience
4279291 one of the outstanding research programs here at virginia tech that attracted me and was the main reason of my decision to pursue my degree here is the genetic improvement of aquaculture species research program
4279292 have opportunities to work closely with active faculty in the area of their expertise
4279293 many faculty members here have research connections and are working with collaborators outside the campus in my case i have a good opportunity to conduct my dissertation focusing on mapping of immune response genes for disease resistance in fish
4279294 here i have access to modern research equipment and have been mentored closely by my research supervisor
4279295 vt has a great support network for international students and the university is large enough that we have active groups of students from many nations that help their fellow students adjust to life in the united states

4279302 mouse skin is different from human skin but the research could help to explain the incidence of some types of skin cancer
4279303 extrapolation between the species for this aspect of biology is simply not warranted many agents that cause skin cancer in mice do not do so in man indeed some of these agents are used as therapies it seems extraordinarily unlikely that the results have any clinical relevance
4279304 if the theory that applying moisturisers increased the risk of non melanoma skin cancers were correct you would expect to see more of these cancers in women and on their faces
4279305 this is not the case so while the research is interesting i dont think any conclusions should be drawn from it at this stage and it should not put people off using skin creams if they wish to do so
4279306 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4279307 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4279308 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4279309 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4279310 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4279311 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4279312 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4279313 after our fall tour last year we took some much needed time off to sort our personal lives out during this period everyone kinda went their separate ways and pursued other goals and interests johnny araya bass and james reid guitar landed guitar teching jobs and have been on the road since darryl stephens drums started jamming with other bands and friends jeff phillips guitar and justin wolfe vocals formed thunderchrist a heavy stoner rock doom band from london ontario canada all of this happening just as our second album is to be released well our album being released coincided with the ending of our contract with our former record label the end records this essentially put us back to the beginning seeing as there was no longer any support from our label this made it impossible to tour in this day and age what a huge kick to the balls just releasing our second album and not being able to support it as you can imagine this set us back present day we are back we have a few new tunes written and they are sure to please we are also probably gonna be doing a few local shows in the coming months be ready we will keep you posted

4279323 we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
4279324 we are not there to defend the ports we are there to provide humanitarian aid
4279325 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4279326 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4279327 is a member state of the united nations and its internationally recognised borders need to be respected the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4279328 georgia is an independent and sovereign state and i think this formula the principle of sovereignty is broader than the formula of territorial integrity
4279329 this morning two females appeared before the chief magistrates at st johns magistrates court having been arrested and charged with offences connected to the murders
4279330 at this stage we are not in a position to disclose any further information as the inquiry continues however further information will be provided in due course when appropriate to do so

4279335 in the long term iran wants a stable democracy in iraq a stable neighbour with a shia majority in the short term it is totally legitimate that there is iranian influence in southern iraq culturally and religious
4279336 the assassinations are back especially in the last two weeks just like before
4279337 two men on a motorbike have been shooting people and five barbers have been killed in the last week alone the militiamen and some of the commanders of the mahdi army are still there they dont carry weapons in public but they are still there a few months ago if you wanted to import anything through the port you had to bribe the mahdi army officials who controlled the port now the iraqi army and the government are in control so you only bribe one official now there is no work apart from collecting garbage it doesnt matter if you are an engineer or a college graduate and you have to bribe someone in the municipality to get work as a street sweeper
4279338 the mahdi army doesnt exist publicly but the killers and assassins are still there and people are still getting killed though less than before the militiamen are wearing government uniforms
4279339 the army raids remind us of what the baathists and saddams mukhabarat secret police used to do we thought that after saddam we would be living in a new iraq but the same system is back for example now the directorate of education is controlled by a new militia theyve started replacing headteachers with their own men
4279340 there is less kidnapping and killing but the militiamen are still there though they are not armed in the streets there are so many of them they cant arrest them if they did theyd have to arrest half of basra if you are a state employee then life is good but if you dont have a fixed salary then things are very hard
4279341 large impact not only on the technical elements of the scheme but also on businesses processes schedules and costs
4279342 we anticipate that situations in which fingerprint image quality is so poor that it is unusable will be extremely rare even in the 75 plus age group print quality is normally perfectly usable
4279343 on the very rare occasions when a fingerprint image falls below the quality required for automated matching it is passed to a fingerprint expert who carries out the coding manually so it can be stored on the database
4279344 suggestions manual checks will suffice every time the computer says no begs the question what is the point of the system in the first place
4279345 higher failure rates for the old ethnic minorities the disabled and the infirm risk creating a biometric underclass
4279346 theres no way you should be able to eat what michael phelps eats this is not even a normal athlete i would not recommend this kind of diet for even a fit and serious competitor in say a 10km road race this man is in a very very different place to the rest of us hes 6ft 4in and 192lb of pure joy from a female perspective obviously though i probably shouldnt say that
4279347 after a 4 500 short course yards moderate morning practice

4279349 say hes doing about four miles a session and a couple of sessions a day
4279350 plus his land training id say hes burning maybe 5 000 calories in training and maybe 2 500 simply to sustain himself something like 8 000 a day in all mind you he is a very big bloke i havent looked at his schedules but 12 000 seems a lot
4279351 ive worked with extreme athletes triathletes for example who work phenomenally hard who expend between 6 000 and 10 000 calories a day
4279352 i can believe someone like phelps is getting through 12 000 and the point is its plainly working for him isnt it nobody could say hes not performing well hes quite clearly expending what hes consuming and just like all of us thats what counts
4279353 it does look quite salty quite fatty not very high in good fibre or in fruit and veg hes certainly not getting his five a day
4279354 i would certainly have expected him to be eating a bit less fat and its all saturated fat the wrong kind i suppose the point with an athlete like phelps though is that he needs a very high calorie intake but a very low volume whereas with the rest of us its the precise reverse we need a low calorie intake and high volume
4279355 and hes going to be burning them at a truly phenomenal rate theres protein in there too obviously which he needs to maintain and repair muscle mass and tissue but for someone like him in a sport like his its really a question of how many carbohydrates he can get in as quickly as possible so this diet might look very high in fat but if he had to eat this same number of calories in a diet that contained for example more fruit and vegetables hed simply never manage it his body just couldnt hold it his intestines would give up hes lucky as it is that he doesnt have a sensitive digestive system thats one of the myriad factors that contribute to make him the exceptional performer he is
4279356 most have been training since they were children remember and its a very difficult transition to make they have to be very very careful because theyre going to be cutting their level of activity to maybe a fifth and their diet has to change accordingly
4279357 i might design him a similar diet but with a bit more fibre maybe wholegrain pastas and bread its plainly not affecting his performance but many people would be constipated on a diet like that that said we all have different needs the important thing for right now is that what hes eating works hes like a turbo powered engine revved up to maximum speed and thats the only reason hes burning it all up different athletes handle carbohydrates differently hes obviously converting them very very effectively but its not a sustainable diet long term
4279358 look he needs these vast amounts of carbohydrates simply to get through the training sessions let alone compete
4279359 he eats swims and sleeps and thats about it when it comes to carbs hes in burn mode most of us particularly the couch potatoes are in storage mode and it really wouldnt do to be storing what youve just eaten on a regular basis
4279360 the good lesson for the rest of us in all this
4279361 is that if we do increase our level of physical activity we can afford to relax a little with the diet if we go to the gym or exercise regularly we can allow ourselves the odd little treat a lot of people make that mistake they think theyve got to deny themselves everything vaguely sinful its not the case
4279362 the average person is going to burn about 400 calories
4279363 hawes has given us a look through the keyhole of a kafka with his trousers down but to call the illustrated magazines he subscribed to as hardcore porn is like comparing a poem by heinrich heine with an advertising slogan for mcdonalds
4279364 this is some idiot who knows nothing about kafka but writes about him as if he did
4279365 were talking about a writer whose psyche the experts have been so keen to decipher they have pored over every memorandum he ever wrote every insurance report he ever compiled looking for clues yet they have chosen not to show this undoubtedly very dark stuff
4279366 i dont remotely claim its a discovery of mine but i was genuinely shocked when i first saw it because i had never seen it in any academic biography of kafka the experts conspiracy of censorship is entertainingly curious
4279367 outrageous and extraordinary the holocaust happened after his death so its ridiculous to talk of his works in that light
4279368 we are devastated and furious but at the same time happy
4279369 finally the literary stylite has fallen from his pedestal and is as much a sinner as you or i
4279370 when gregor samsa woke up one morning from unsettling dreams he found himself changed in his bed into a monstrous vermin
4279371 it reflects the socio economic problems and low aspirations in places like the north east its part of a wider social story there are many more independent and selective schools in the southern half of the country than in the north
4279372 for many independent schools their reason for being is to get their results up but its just the result of creaming off the best by definition if you cream off the best you will get different results
4279373 there were 75 000 more entries in the maintained sector getting as at a level
4279374 this makes it more important for universities to take into account contextual information about a student when they apply
4279375 it is very worrying that there is such a large gap in achievement between different areas of the country the government is letting down children in the more disadvantaged areas who as a result fall behind in school
4279376 there is now a clear divide at the heart of our education system ministers must work to find the reasons for this inequality and ensure that any improvements in our schools and colleges benefit all students
4279377 we are doing well but we need to do better at ensuring that every school in every part of the country benefits from those improvements
4279378 i think we should celebrate standards improving just as we would celebrate any olympic medal
4279379 the soaring price of petrol has made hotel owners gas and electricity bills even bigger
4279380 many customers grow tired or disillusioned when confronted by the rise in prices which hasnt necessarily been accompanied by an improvement in the quality of service
4279381 the new projections move up some of the changes that are happening the minority population now will become the majority eight or nine years earlier than we had thought
4279382 it means theres going to be a young old divide
4279383 but the over 65s will primarily remain white and will stay that way the challenge for any national politician will be appealing to such diverse interests at both ends of the spectrum

4279390 steve hadley the us national security adviser voiced objections to ahmadinejads trip when he visited ankara a month ago
4279391 the attitude was weve allowed them to host manouchehr mottaki and saeed jalili respectively irans foreign minister and chief nuclear negotiator but having ahmadinejad was sending the wrong signal
4279392 however the turks explained that he had been pressing for a visit to turkey for a while and that they couldnt say no any longer to meet american reservations they promised they wouldnt sign any major energy deals apart from maybe something on electricity and would pressure ahmadinejad to accept the un security council incentive package in exchange for suspending uranium enrichment
4279393 it is our neighbour after all its realpolitik we are obliged to this evil

4279395 in particular a person can commit the offence even when he or she did not intend members of the public to be directly or indirectly encouraged by his or her statement to commit acts of terrorism but where his or her statement was understood by some members of the public as encouragement to commit such acts
4279396 libel lawyers in this country have remained insouciant to the deficiencies highlighted by the un
4279397 free speech has been a victim of the war on terror with offences of encouragement and glorification of terrorism threatening to make careless talk a crime
4279398 hes never read novels hes read one in his life its the catcher in the rye and he cant go straight from the catcher in the rye to me because thats not fair
4279399 and then he can read mine he doesnt have the concentration span to read a novel
4279400 but very quickly it all became the same so slight and so annoying and cutesy i wanted to do something that was more grown up and funnier in a spikier way rather than a girly way im not a girly girl at all
4279401 i spent my whole childhood trying to find places to be on my own i used to sit on the water tank in the attic or in the dogs kennel i was quite a strange child
4279402 i am by nature quite self contained and shy and i would generally just sit in a room on my own and not speak
4279403 the feature i hate most about myself is my self consciousness and i was too self conscious to show anybody i never had the confidence in myself i had to leave my job and shame myself into doing it by telling everybody i was off to write a novel i gave myself a year and if nothing happened i thought id go back to work luckily penguin picked it up
4279404 i have occasionally thought people were digging at that and that does upset me i have gone out of my way to try and do it in the proper way
4279405 im not na ve i know the guardian probably wouldnt speak to me at this point in my career if it werent for him but im not generally one of those people who would just witter on about my relationship in real life it doesnt bother me at all that im pretty much just thought of as his girlfriend ive got no desire to be famous myself
4279406 i didnt know there was this whole world of literature that was much more conversational and funny and modern it was also very spiky which fitted well with my sensibilities
4279407 obviously hes a complete shit at the beginning but i wanted to break him down and see if i could redeem him
4279408 a lot of people are deluded everyone is in some way or another and its quite fascinating to try to get underneath it and find out what people are like without that grandiose kind of thing
4279409 what im doing is what im good at i dont know that i could write the great british novel hopefully its grown up chick lit or chick lit with an edge but it would bother me if people put it with all the pink fluffy i must get married stuff because i hope that it stands out from that
4279410 because im 47 and i would ask a 47 year old woman that question
4279411 i was never like little girls who love baby dolls and talk about their weddings ive never had that thing to have a child and i really really believe that if youre going to have a child you should really want one bizarrely ive been called selfish for not having children surely its more selfish to have a child when you dont really want a child
4279412 because i would lose im very uncompetitive about work because i cant stand losing
4279413 we will make the reconstruction of public service facilities such as schools and hospitals our priority and turn them into extremely safe and solid structures that the public can feel reassured about
4279414 as well as a home our biggest need is justice for my dead child but i know that is something that nobody can help us with
4279415 i ask for the families forgiveness and prayers and i will pray for your families and loved ones
4279416 does your mind ever think about anything else mine wont
4279417 whether you can even have a criminal prosecution for something that the government itself sets up
4279418 this is a first step in a correct direction but that cant erase what has happened in the past few years
4279419 everyone knows exactly what you have to do in every circumstance everyone tries to do it confident that everyone else is doing it and anyone who fails will be subjected to the justified scorn of everybody

4279424 stocks go up and down and things may be different tomorrow but i thought it was worth a moment of reflection today
4279425 this bulletin paints a picture of wide discrepancy between the number of men who take are treated for or even die from drug use compared to the number of women
4279426 the fact more than 1 500 people died due to drug use in 2006 is extremely saddening in itself but the fact so many of these deaths are male raises many questions about gender and drug misuse
4279427 more people than ever before are getting into and staying in treatment drug related deaths are down and the level of drug fuelled crime has fallen substantially
4279428 the high quality drug treatment that is being provided is the most effective way of reducing illegal drug misuse improving the physical and mental health of drug users as well as reducing the harm they cause to themselves and society
4279429 clearly too few people who misuse drugs are being identified and admitted to drug rehabilitation courses early on which has contributed to this worrying rise in admissions to hospitals
4279430 as drugs get stronger the harm they are doing to young peoples mental health is increasing the government needs to wake up to the scale of the problem
4279431 more than twice as many young men were admitted as young women which suggests men may be more likely to self medicate with illicit drugs to manage their emotional distress many of these admissions may be related to other pre existing mental health problems such as depression or feelings of alienation for which we need much earlier intervention and support when families and others express their concerns
4279432 to end the war in the pacific and save lives
4279433 japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped
4279434 kofi annan was saying the fact that he didnt have the security council on his back every single move was enormously liberating
4279435 normally in a recording studio you chop away as you go but with this there was no time there was a mountain that needed clearing and sorting and every time someone looked at it vertigo was the result and im a perfectionist so it took a while to satisfy me as well
4279436 because we never found a way to make it pay for itself but id love to do it again it was among the most exciting musical moments i have ever had we may have dreams of women and money but fun is still the motive for a lot of people starting in music and theres nothing like being with a group of musicians and generating something that hasnt existed before
4279437 the taste may be a little foreign at first but after a while you get to like it if we can absorb the world which we need to do that is part of a globalisation process i have a lot of sympathy for the anti globalisation movement but i think its the wrong word womad has always been a globalisation festival to me
4279438 like all good evangelists wed love it to have taken over the world but it has opened a lot of doors for a lot of artists and for that everyone involved feels very proud its the only festival i know of thats been exported
4279439 im looking at different ways of opening up womad so i hope some of the original ideas might be looked at again originally we were trying to do more with poetry film and art and it would be great to find a way of getting more of that
4279440 but i do see a connection at the first womad we had echo and the bunnymen playing with the burundi drummers
4279441 getting a group of superheroes to work together i do think that governments are in some ways the record companies of the governance world in the sense that the old models are redundant in some areas
4279442 if you have the elders whose phone calls will not be refused and rejected by any statesman you have some means of influencing events
4279443 was a once in a lifetime opportunity and more pressing for me than a genesis reunion even though it could be fun to do some time but its not necessarily something i would want to live in
4279444 its a nice place to visit but not somewhere you want to move back to necessarily
4279445 the situation we face is a situation of stagnation and steep slowdown
4279446 the german economy has got to get through a rough patch for growth in the coming months
4279447 but overall theres no reason for excessive pessimism based on the development of the first half of the year
4279448 there is a good chance the economy is already in recession but even if it isnt the outlook remains for subdued growth in the quarters to come
4279449 net trade is still likely to make a small positive contribution to gdp growth this year and next
4279450 but this will be due to a weakening in import growth as the domestic economy weakens rather than a major strengthening in export growth and it will not be enough to prevent the uk from entering a recession and from activity slowing by even more than the bank of england expects
4279451 todays reports paint a similar picture sharp corrections in fixed investment and exports those having been the main engine of growth over the past few years and stagnating private consumption
4279452 these are the two companies most currently identified with the notion of innovation not just in silicon valley or in this country but arguably in the world

4279461 many customers grow tired or disillusioned when confronted by the rise in prices which hasnt necessarily been accompanied by an improvement in the quality of service
4279462 we dont want the collapse of georgia but the de facto situation is such that neither the south ossetians nor the abkhaz want to live in the same state with the person who has sent his troops against them
4279463 that we support any decision taken by the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia we will not only support them but guarantee them in the caucasus and in the whole world right is on your side
4279464 the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia are not called into question in future talks
4279465 any reference to the territorial integrity of georgia would simply be seen as an insult a deeply human insult
4279466 the sharp rise in bank repossessions combined with slow sales has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank owned properties for sale
4279467 if we dont get an unexpected shock that pushes commodity prices back up this might be the worst inflation news well get for a while
4279468 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4279469 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4279470 we are planning it it depends on many factors i cant give you the date we have stopped building up troops
4279471 we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
4279472 we are not there to defend the ports we are there to provide humanitarian aid
4279473 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4279474 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4279475 is a member state of the united nations and its internationally recognised borders need to be respected the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4279476 georgia is an independent and sovereign state and i think this formula the principle of sovereignty is broader than the formula of territorial integrity
4279477 steve hadley the us national security adviser voiced objections to ahmadinejads trip when he visited ankara a month ago
4279478 the attitude was weve allowed them to host manouchehr mottaki and saeed jalili respectively irans foreign minister and chief nuclear negotiator but having ahmadinejad was sending the wrong signal
4279479 however the turks explained that he had been pressing for a visit to turkey for a while and that they couldnt say no any longer to meet american reservations they promised they wouldnt sign any major energy deals apart from maybe something on electricity and would pressure ahmadinejad to accept the un security council incentive package in exchange for suspending uranium enrichment
4279480 it is our neighbour after all its realpolitik we are obliged to this evil
4279481 property prices have more than doubled since march one house is going for 90 000 a threefold increase
4279482 the uk is getting close to what we set out to achieve
4279483 there is a view the militia is going to come back its not going to happen we are not going to see parts of basra going back to militia control
4279484 in the long term iran wants a stable democracy in iraq a stable neighbour with a shia majority in the short term it is totally legitimate that there is iranian influence in southern iraq culturally and religious
4279485 the assassinations are back especially in the last two weeks just like before
4279486 two men on a motorbike have been shooting people and five barbers have been killed in the last week alone the militiamen and some of the commanders of the mahdi army are still there they dont carry weapons in public but they are still there a few months ago if you wanted to import anything through the port you had to bribe the mahdi army officials who controlled the port now the iraqi army and the government are in control so you only bribe one official now there is no work apart from collecting garbage it doesnt matter if you are an engineer or a college graduate and you have to bribe someone in the municipality to get work as a street sweeper
4279487 the mahdi army doesnt exist publicly but the killers and assassins are still there and people are still getting killed though less than before the militiamen are wearing government uniforms
4279488 the army raids remind us of what the baathists and saddams mukhabarat secret police used to do we thought that after saddam we would be living in a new iraq but the same system is back for example now the directorate of education is controlled by a new militia theyve started replacing headteachers with their own men
4279489 there is less kidnapping and killing but the militiamen are still there though they are not armed in the streets there are so many of them they cant arrest them if they did theyd have to arrest half of basra if you are a state employee then life is good but if you dont have a fixed salary then things are very hard
4279490 the new projections move up some of the changes that are happening the minority population now will become the majority eight or nine years earlier than we had thought
4279491 it means theres going to be a young old divide
4279492 but the over 65s will primarily remain white and will stay that way the challenge for any national politician will be appealing to such diverse interests at both ends of the spectrum
4279493 the situation we face is a situation of stagnation and steep slowdown
4279494 the german economy has got to get through a rough patch for growth in the coming months

4279500 in these parts the subprime crisis seems very remote and fears of an autumn recession dont exist
4279501 the most worrying things for the new owners are the rise in the number of jellyfish and an odd decision by the mayor of saint tropez to forbid overflights by helicopters
4279502 we are nice people and we get rewarded like this

4279508 one of my favorite writers is oscar wilde and even though he is famous for countless witticisms my favorite wilde quote isnt witty or clever
4279509 my favorite quote is its amazing what you can do if you dont know you cant do it im not sure who said it it may be a combination of things ive heard over the years but its proven to be true for me many many times
4279510 i love this quote because i often get caught up in trying to have and do it all and then i remember that i am the only one who can set the standards for myself i dont have to meet anyones expectations other than my own its easier said than done

4279548 i am convinced that honouring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4279549 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4279550 in a sense theyve got obama hostage and are exacting their ransom
4279551 the only good thing about this game was the 0 0 scoreline
4279552 we are all disappointed pepe reina who saved a penalty was definitely the man of the match it was difficult but we are looking for revenge in the second leg
4279553 i didnt expect that at all i wasnt as strong on the last 400m as usual
4279554 taking a couple of seconds off my best will be tough
4279555 a few people are critical but it does not mean we are not fulfilling our promises

4279557 this location the effort is due out via on august 26th and august 25th intentionally heres the track list
4279558 dit systeem moet voorkomen dat beroepskrachten langs elkaar heen werken
4279559 daar staat geen inhoudelijke informatie in alleen de naam van de jeugdige en de beroepskracht die hem eerder heeft ingevoerd
4279560 het elektronisch kinddossier en de verwijsindex worden vaak door elkaar gehaald maar dat is onterecht het kinddossier is de digitale vervanging van het medische dossier van een kind op het consultatiebureau
4279561 de problemen van een jongere zijn met een melding in dit systeem natuurlijk niet opgelost beroepskrachten moeten ook echt zelf contact zoeken met elkaar en samen actie ondernemen
4279562 ik wil niet arrogant zijn maar ik was hier niet gekomen voor een bronzen medaille ik kwam hier voor de eerste plaats en ik geloofde erin dat het zou lukken als ik iets slimmer had gezwommen had ik een bronzen medaille kunnen halen maar het goud was mijn droom daar heb ik risicos voor genomen
4279563 na het keerpunt tijdens de laatste 50 meter van mijn carri re wilde ik er nog n keer voor gaan ik wist dat ik een risico moest nemen om de concurrentie te verslaan
4279564 binnen mijn mogelijkheden heb ik er alles aan gedaan ik heb vele offers gebracht maar heb dat met plezier gedaan ik voelde me prima voor de race heb ervan genoten maar ik had graag willen winnen en ik was een waardeloos sportman geweest als ik nu niet teleurgesteld zou zijn
4279565 het is geen opluchting die ik nu voel want ik weet dat ik het zal gaan missen opstaan en weten dat je goed bent en een wedstrijd gaat zwemmen is het mooiste dat is er het is al die jaren een fantastisch avontuur geweest maar het is goed zo het is tijd om er een streep onder te zetten
4279566 met deze pillen stel je spieren in staat om meer vet te verbranden maar die verbranding moet je wel zelf activeren door uit je stoel te komen
4279567 humanity has made a move forward in evolution especially that of the woman aspect all of us have a feminine nature it is this nature that is so greatly karmically bound as we work with our new spiritual cleansing tools apply the self i dentity through hooponopono process and care for our sub conscious selves we facilitate our own evolution and that of the feminine nature thank god really without the cleaning we would be forever stuck
4279568 will anyone be interested by the time he finally sucks a dick or spreads his cheeks for some man action
4279569 damn i thought nwk was all about fresh shoes and hip hop read rahs post right under this for your fix whats with this flash developer stuff
4279570 measuring the informal economy in latin america and the caribbean
4279571 nevertheless this clear notion is not present in certain sectors of congress who is still pushing
4279572 the main consideration was the national interest the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
4279573 the pc industry is bending over backwards to be seen as inclusive but yet mobile and entertainment devices are outselling pcs and laptops by three to one
4279574 they are more inclusive than any other and as a result there are powerful devices in the hands of many learners good teachers can use off the shelf software as powerful contextual hubs for learning in and out of the school
4279575 but i think theyre still looking for the door marked entry serious games are seriously boring
4279576 were not talking about serious games were talking about game based learning
4279577 offer big improvements in learning without needing to be didactic or boring
4279578 the domain of the school is presented to kids but we have to pay more attention to children s own domains in this case merging the games domain and school domain
4279579 this is to have an understanding that children dont come to school from a vacuum they come from homes a society a culture and we have to take this on board
4279580 children come to school from a world where everything involves technology schools dismiss this and will become irrelevant if they dont pay attention
4279581 they come in with their power suits on and go what is this pish and walk out raving
4279582 we align ourselves with the asian americans with the african americans and we work very closely with them so we can collaborate where we can help each other out
4279583 first generation even though they may be here working the service industry or whatever it may be theyre already starting their own businesses on this side here
4279584 those issues also impact our small businesses not so much in the economic factor but because we do have families
4279585 we are hard pressed on every side but not crushed perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not abandoned struck down but not destroyed
4279586 since he wasnt aware of his actions and was manipulated into destroying an entire species should he be punished or locked up to ensure that no one else can aim the gun that is ender at someone else
4279587 anyone who does anything that drives people away from the gods is a liar and through faith and discipline you will achieve omniscience

4279598 newer games like virtua fighter are unplayable but its good for stuff like puzzle bobble
4279599 the real genius of the game is the balance the nine different character classes all feel useful and the team that plays as a team pretty much always wins the variety of game modes is also impressive
4279600 god i wish i could make a pie right now
4279601 human rights abuses notwithstanding and given the general shitness of the olympics its some impressive choreography cant somehow see london coming up with anything anywhere near as good unless its some sort of massive knife fight

4279606 is it wrong that my main thoughts are id really like on of those russian apcs in the event of a zombie uprising
4279607 tanks are useless in a zombie apocalypse youd be fine while theres fuel in the tank but as soon as you run out youre effectively trapped with nowhere to go the logistics needed to keep a mechanised force in use are massive
4279608 our record financial results continue to validate our business strategy and demonstrate the significant progress towards our goals
4279609 during this quarter we increased our sales and margins across all product segments in addition to increases in our formulation business and new product offerings despite the rising raw material prices our unit costs for 7 aca and clavulanic acid were further reduced and have been among the lowest level in the industry mainly due to our continuous improvements in the manufacturing technology improved cost structure and operational efficiency combined with synergistic benefits from the vertical production operations have led to five fold increases in net profit for the second straight quarter with enhanced competitive advantages we believe dragon pharma is well positioned for strong performance in 2008
4279610 when she put them on i thought oh my goodness it is inappropriate because it is sexually suggestive
4279611 you just never know who could see that and think it was a bit too enticing for a young child to be wearing
4279612 this is part of a worrying trend of inappropriate clothing marketed at young children

4279615 were not seeing any evidence that students are being affected at this point
4279616 most students are able to put together alternatives to come up with a financial aid package that works for them
4279617 students use that to cover the gap between what students receive in financial aid and what the college actually costs
4279618 talk to your financial aid offices and they will help you with your options students will be able to return to their schools

4279624 it would be na ve to say that if i got enough users on youtube i could retire because it wont happen
4279625 advertisers are wary of putting ads on amateur content based sites
4279626 its not just about of the risk of controversial content but confusion over how to use such channels effectively
4279627 have a track record of understanding and compliance with youtubes terms of service
4279628 you see youtube partners who started out as amateurs signed to talent deals appearing on tv shows represented by agencies and contracted by advertisers

4279634 when we look at what god gave up for us his only son who died a horrible death on the cross and what jesus gave up his rightful place in heaven with his father it doesnt seem silly to sell it all and head overseas to follow him
4279635 it can be compared to someone stealing the traffic lights on a busy main street
4279636 there is a lot of optimism in the biotech sector
4279637 it could be mergers and acquisitions in the space it could be new drugs getting further along in the approval process in the pipeline
4279638 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head and saw big flames
4279639 we rushed to the scene and saw charred bodies while wounded people were crying for help pots and burned prayer rugs were scattered all over the place
4279640 seconds later i saw fire and flaying pieces of flesh
4279641 i fell down and i was able to see one of my legs bleeding people were running in all directions
4279642 maybe nobody thought i could do it so i havent had any offers to do it
4279643 but if anybody pushed him or tested him on that theyd be making a terrible mistake
4279644 all of the things you know about chris i know about him
4279645 hes the absolute top of the line one classy man bright articulate energetic
4279646 chris is one of the kindest most gentlemanly people i know
4279647 that shouldnt be a negative that should be a positive but perhaps in a search for todays managers people are looking for something other than that
4279648 we were delighted when we had a chance to bring him back in the system
4279649 i know in the last couple years hes been looking for an opportunity to advance in his career it hasnt happened
4279650 when we knew he was out there and available even though it wasnt at the major league level
4279651 we wanted to bring him back because it would be a positive development in the development of our young players we think the guys who are exposed to chris chambliss come away better as baseball players and persons
4279652 ill keep working and keep learning and maybe an opportunity will come
4279653 i still want to manage i cant give up on that dream its something i want to do
4279654 our focus on environmental restoration and infrastructure construction has provided a foundation to provide increased value to our client and its recycling programs in tennessee
4279655 these projects are integral to our growth strategy as they help us establish a foothold in the infrastructure construction business
4279656 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4279657 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4279658 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
4279659 los laicos en el no es ajena a ning n tema que toca a la ciudadan a lo ha hecho incluso en circunstancias m s adversas de ecuador y no es novedad

4279661 sacerdotes de izquierda con el pueblo y de derecha con las lites
4279662 he conocido sacerdotes que han trabajado ejemplarmente sin estar hablando siempre o haciendo opciones de disenso hay que reconocer que nuestros pueblos tienen un sustrato de fe que no se puede desvirtuar ni reinterpretar la teolog a tiene un campo propio y
4279663 abandonando el camino y yo lo he lamentado porque algunos han sido sacerdotes conocidos y amigos
4279664 for us to be anywhere close to double digits represented a huge change from the past
4279665 now in august weve had two new polls one showing about a 6 point lead one a 7 point lead
4279666 but franklin said there has been a shift statewide in party identification
4279667 so the upshot of that is theres been a shift in party balance over the last four years that could be very important to the state and democratic candidates in the state
4279668 i think the polls that come out a week or two after the conventions are going to be critical for telling us whether were going to be again one of these competitive swing states or whether the state has shifted enough that one candidate or the other will maintain a lead
4279669 deadlocked llc cannot validly retain counsel and file an answer
4279670 beverwycks operating agreement spells out unequivocally the circumstances under which the llc will be dissolved
4279671 it is clear from the evidence that no liquidation was or is contemplated by the controlling shareholders in our case and thus a liquidation or semi liquidation scenario is not appropriate when dealing with the big tax
4279672 under these circumstances with the big representing such a large portion of corporate assets it appears that a willing purchaser would expect to deduct the present value of the big tax along with a percentage for lack of marketability
4279673 una cosa es lo que te ofrezcan a ti y otra a nosotros tienes que entender que t vales m s de 25 millones

4279675 this iraqi forces surge explains how we can continue to see very low levels of violence even though coalition forces have taken away a lot of combat power based
4279676 the operations in basra really instituted the rule of law there
4279677 the people there are able to live freely again without intimidation and extortion by militias
4279678 what you saw and what youre seeing now in mosul and diyala is a more determined enemy in terms of holding ground
4279679 the iraqis are really developing and have come a long way
4279680 it takes a while to develop the kind of leadership theyve shown were focusing on that key leadership and bolstering them so we have a vibrant and successful counterinsurgency force
4279681 oh but it is true things need not have happened to be true tales and dreams are the shadow truths that will endure when mere facts are dust and ashes and forgot
4279682 it has always been the prerogative of children and half wits to point out that the emperor has no clothes

4279686 the business of a corporation shall be managed under the direction of its board of directors
4279687 where there are only two stockholders each with a 50 shares an action cannot be maintained in the name of the corporation by one stockholder against another with an equal interest and degree of control over corporate affairs
4279688 bring or maintain an appropriate action to obtain relief on the ground that the merger will be or is unlawful or fraudulent
4279689 the nature of the transaction giving rise to the limited partners right to receive payment and all other relevant factors
4279690 allows a dissenting limited partner to raise the issue of fraud illegality breach of fiduciary responsibility or other deceitful acts by the general partner that may have resulted in less compensation than the limited partner should have received
4279691 a cceptance of the limited partners argument would allow them to bypass the appraisal process even though they are asserting that the compensation they received for their shares was inadequate
4279692 expressly prohibit the availability of the common law right of a limited partner to seek damages as a result of a breach of contract premised on a general partners alleged violation of a partnership agreement and the aiding and abetting of such breach by others
4279693 t he legislature surely did not intend section 121 1102 to insulate a general partner from an action for damages resulting from a breach of contract merely because the merger or consolidation was successfully completed

4279704 when limited liability companies seek judicial dissolution will the statute be up to the task
4279705 merely because it is found that the corporate business has been or could be conducted at a profit
4279706 can continue to operate and make further profit for its members
4279707 plain and ordinary content and intent of the parties and the operating agreement of the llc was and is to make a profit for the members perry youngwall and nils youngwall
4279708 it is not reasonably practicable to carry on the profitability
4279709 the valuation of a closely held company is an inexact science

4279713 signify his consent to the foregoing terms by signing this letter in the space below
4279714 commence legal proceedings for the dissolution of berle farm llc
4279715 believes this agreement is a faithful representation of all matters formerly addressed and affixes his signature below to affirm his acceptance of this agreement
4279716 agreement is a faithful representation of all matters formerly addressed and affixes his signature below to affirm his acceptance of this agreement
4279717 prepared and transmitted the buy sell agreement to accept berles buy out proposal prior to the deadline for the purpose of avoiding litigation
4279718 leave the transaction incomplete and without binding force in the absence of a positive agreement that it should not be binding until so reduced to writing and formally executed
4279719 it is understood that this is not a binding agreement and that the obligations and rights of the parties shall be set forth in the definitive agreement to be executed by the parties
4279720 the judgment or order directs the execution of any instrument and the instrument is executed and deposited in the office where the original judgment or order is entered to abide the direction of the court to which the appeal is taken
4279721 the judgment or order directs the assignment or delivery of personal property and the property is placed in the custody of an officer designated by the court of original instance to abide the direction of the court to which the appeal is taken
4279722 implicitly required the parties to execute a written instrument binding them to the negotiated terms and conditions of the buy sell agreement to which such transfer was subject
4279723 both parties attempted to skew their testimonies regarding this incident to their best advantage and that neither was entirely candid
4279724 the dissolution of the company and the distribution of assets was simply not a priority for tal at least until the commencement of the current proceeding in 2007
4279725 work s in a local liquor store that has a concession and i review their candy prices
4279726 seizing control of the llcs assets attempting to shield them from tal by moving the assets around different companies and then adding to the existing assets
4279727 usurpation of some 25 000 in corporate funds in september 2002
4279728 prejudice to plotkin if now after all these years liability would be imposed upon him for assets and profits acquired after tals initial proceeding was dismissed
4279729 fairest and most equitable approach to this situation is to proceed in accordance with section 704 c of the limited liability company law and to provide for a return to tal of his membership contribution and then for a distribution based on his membership interest
4279730 as having achieved an effective and permanent parting of the ways in december 2002
4279731 because plotkin effectively commingled the assets of the llc with later acquired assets
4279732 he may not now be heard to complain that tal should be limited to enforcing his rights to principal in excess of 250 000 against assets now said to be worth 32 500
4279733 title to the debtors property will remain in the bankruptcy estate unless the property is listed in the schedule of assets filed with the bankruptcy court or otherwise deemed abandoned
4279734 a debtors failure to list a legal claim as an asset in his or her bankruptcy proceeding causes the claim to remain the property of the bankruptcy estate and precludes the debtor from pursuing the claim on his or her own behalf
4279735 is not lightly discarded in favor of summary disposition even at the behest of the party which originally opposed the summary judgment motion reviewed by the appellate division
4279736 for apparently carrying on in the usual way the business of the limited liability company
4279737 that a meeting of romsa was held during which the retainer was authorized by a vote of the members nor is there any evidence that the initiation of a lawsuit in the entitys name against one of its members was duly authorized
4279738 s ince this is a dispute between partners over the interpretation of the rights and obligations under the partnership agreement it is not a proceeding by or against the partnership citation omitted even though the partnership is made a nominal party plaintiff
4279739 that plaintiff commenced the lawsuit which caused the need for the additional contribution
4279740 does not constitute an exception to his obligations to the llc
4279741 that suggests the indemnification obligation arose from action or inaction constituting gross negligence wilful misconduct or bad faith
4279742 such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters such that he is capable of evaluating the terms and provisions of this agreement and the other transaction documents
4279743 refers to the specific subject matter as to which the representations are alleged with precise specificity to put the plaintiff littman on notice as to the clauses intended effect
4279744 when a fiduciary in furtherance of its individual interests deals with the beneficiary of the duty in a matter relating to the fiduciary relationship the fiduciary is strictly obligated to make full disclosure of all material facts
4279745 the crux of plaintiffs claim is that defendants misinformed him that there were no other financial documents forcing him to proceed with the evaluation with the limited information they made available when they possessed other vital information
4279746 lost the right to receive dividends declared and paid by jersey after the consummation of the reorganization on november 30 2001
4279747 the dissenting shareholder shall cease to have any of the rights of a shareholder except the right to be paid the fair value of his shares and any other rights under this section
4279748 is clearly among the rights lost upon consummation of the corporate action
4279749 reinstated to all his rights as a shareholder as of the consummation of the corporate action including the right to payment of any intervening dividend or other distribution
4279750 the right to receive any dividend paid following the consummation of the corporate action
4279751 could only be reinstated upon a dissenting shareholders loss of his dissenters rights if as a prior matter the shareholders exercise of his dissenters rights had triggered his loss of the right to receive any such dividend

4279754 living rough are in a really sheltered spot are probably given a thick dry mulch of straw or bracken pegged down under fleece or that the sheer size of the clump means that at least some of it may get frost protection from its own foliage as it dies down
4279755 if any plant is weak and sissy it has to go
4279756 with such a limited palette you have to repeat things so many gardens fail by not repeating plants it is often a good idea to create a matrix for the garden as a whole

4279765 the old lags thought it would take two years to slowly grind down the market but it has been a faster and more furious fall than has ever been experienced its like being in clear water now were not at the bottom but we can see it
4279766 the loan to value rate has gone up again which would imply that lenders are not expecting the market to drop further from here
4279767 we held an auction last week with 17 conventional lots with a lot of repossessions and successfully sold 12 of them to a packed room of nearly 300 people

4279777 enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on airfares from record fuel costs

4279782 this is a pricing matter we cant discuss future plans
4279783 many military have government travel cards that can be used for fees
4279784 average roundtrip cost of jet fuel todays prices is about 300 per passenger we would have to charge about 650 700 a passenger to break even
4279785 fares probably need to increase at this point another 15 20 percent before airlines cover their costs
4279786 at some point it becomes like a saturday night live skit where youre paying for a seat belt and to use the bathroom theyre running out of things to charge us for

4279797 we told them that the moa was needed to build the confidence of the milf in the negotiations and that sometimes processes like this require confidentiality
4279798 painful sentiments came out on why the local government leaders were not informed of the moa ad it was our fist time to see a copy of it we were enlightened but still others opposed some provisions like the inclusion of their barangays
4279799 the moa is not the final agreement thats one of the issues clarified
4279800 it will go through an intricate long drawn constitutional process
4279801 in case of any aggression or transgression of the law by the milf they will be defended by the armed forces
4279802 they are going to take one third of the province the eight barangays in the four towns are mostly christian dominated we want out of the agreement
4279803 basically what they do is they take the scraps from the factory cutting table and instead of throwing them away as waste they put them back into the milling process
4279804 scraps are disintegrated and then put back into cotton yarn and theyre woven back into new denim
4279805 were actually starting to see certain celebrities popping up wearing more oversized typically more boyfriend looks that are more slouchy a little bit more relaxed so its a new interpretation of the deconstructed pant
4279806 the skinny jean is not going to go away completely but i think now you can do something thats still figure flattering without feeling that youre not on trend
4279807 i think that the raise of the waist and the fuller leg of the pant is really important for a lot of us who dont feel 100 per cent in our skinny jeans
4279808 a nice medium to dark shade of indigo can really look polished during the day with a great blazer and a good shoe and then very easily can transform into a nighttime setting by peeling off the jacket and wearing a flirty top
4279809 what can happen with curvier women is they have to size up in order to accommodate perhaps more weight that theyre carrying in their hips and the waistband can then tend to not fit snugly around their waist which leads to a little bit of an unfinished type of look
4279810 as well a boot leg really helps to proportion the leg as well as elongate the leg on a curvier body type
4279811 the skinny will really hug the body and give you an appearance of feminine curves and a trouser almost camouflages a lack of curves and will create an a line shape which can also be really really exciting
4279812 this was very serious the investigations will go on for some time
4279813 i believe shes become a terrible embarrassment to them but shes not a terrorist
4279814 when the truth comes out people will see she did nothing wrong

4279834 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4279835 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4279836 what defenses does georgia have because of the cease fire agreement which russia has not honored georgian troops are being moved to organize a defensive line 10 kilometers six miles away from tbilisi
4279837 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4279838 that choice will end his bid for the presidency and spell defeat for other republican candidates
4279839 hes not even sure christian conservatives would vote for him let alone work for him if he picked a pro abortion running mate
4279840 a good portion of us were urging him to pick a pro life running mate
4279841 that choice would go a long way to solidify his credentials
4279842 wrong headed short sighted fracture the republican party and not allow us to capitalize on the democratic partys fracture right now
4279843 if he does that it makes our job 100 times harder it would dampen enthusiasm at a time when evangelicals are looking for ways to gin up enthusiasm
4279844 some people in the movement say it would be the kiss of death he heard that in the room last night
4279845 wrong headed short sighted fracture the republican party and not allow us to capitalize on the democratic partys fracture right now

4279857 accreditation is rather a tool to find out how good we are as an international hospital
4279858 to provide a self assessment tool through which organizations can assess and continue to develop and improve their services by reference to external standards
4279859 trent is more down to earth they inspect the hospital they acquire knowledge of the prevailing locale compare it with international standards and sit down with us and tell us what we need to work on or improve

4279875 love one another but only if theyre white straight and legal citizens
4279876 even cynics might concede that again four capable actresses have pulled off a relatively rare thing theyve convinced us theyre an honest to god movie sisterhood
4279877 its refreshing to see young women portrayed as something other than the hot chicks in the latest blockbuster
4279878 as chick flicks go this is one men can attend with the expectation that they might just enjoy experiencing two hours alongside these down to earth appealing characters
4279879 i loved the first movie and its great seeing the girls back together
4279880 to be able to basically find a story where all the characters were dealing with loss or the possibility of loss i felt comfortable in that world
4279881 i definitely believe in miracles i dont know about believing in the face of jesus on a wall or something that specific i like the idea of playing a guy who definitely doesnt believe and is kind of forced through all these things that happen to think about it because i know that happens to people either something good that happens or something bad that happens can change how somebody feels very quickly
4279882 i grew up catholic and heard about these kinds of things happening faces appearing on objects and how they effected people in certain communities and started to think about what kind of person who would be the worst person for something like this to happen to and that was the starting point it came at a time when i didnt really have a career in screenwriting at that point and i quit writing and then i got kind of depressed myself much like the character and realized that i needed to start writing but write something i wanted to see versus something that i thought i could sell to somebody
4279883 i liked the sincerity of the story i was actually impressed by mark who kind of wears his heart on his sleeve unabashedly i think he wanted to expose himself in that way in the movie and he wanted the actors to expose vulnerability to their characters and keep it very real and very simple and naturalstic as much as there is a comedic tone to the story it is very engaging emotionally because it feels very real and i like that tone
4279884 i believe in miracles but not only in catholic or religious miracles i believe in miracles because life is a miracle itself i survive two heart attacks i survived many losses in my life and i survive loss of my faith and i recovered my faith i believe really in miracles since i was henry poole years ago and i was walking in an airport i was so sad and so depressed in that moment because it was really a horrible moment in my life and then i looked up and then a woman that i dont know i didnt know who is she walk in front of me and smile at me in that moment i thought oh my god people smile
4279885 i think there is a thirst in culture for some sort of spiritual sustenance and i think the movie kind of feeds that without preaching anything i think the fact that it is the face of jesus sort of suits the story and suits the street where the story is set if it was in another country it would be the face of somebody else
4279886 stylistically i felt like i had done in my videos there was a greater range of kind of emotional and tonal choices in a lot of videos in movies i had only done those two and my life is very different now then it was then so i was looking for something that showed the range of feelings i wanted to express
4279887 i found some spirituality later in life in not being healthy and being healthy when i was going to have my surgery and you lay on the table and you dont have anything on and there isnt anything to really grab except for what you believe in since that point ive become a little more connected to spirituality i had kidney transplant three years ago ive got a lot of medicine running through me but im good
