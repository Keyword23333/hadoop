10000 was able to walk the streets of sadr city last wednesday
10001 this operation is iraqi led our forces are playing a supporting role
10002 the iraqis will continue taking the lead in more military operations across the country
10003 beginning tomorrow troops deploying to iraq will serve 12 month tours instead of 15 month tours
10004 this will ease the burden on our forces it will make life easier for our wonderful military families
10005 al qaida is on the run in iraq but the terrorists remain dangerous and they are determined to strike our country and our allies again
10006 in this time of war america is grateful to all the men and women who have stepped up forward to defend us
10007 we did not win this war and it is proper that those who directed it should take responsibility
10008 too much under the sway of the soros he is much anger there is in him too much pride in his powers
10009 asked the other day if he ever doubted himself obama replied smartly
10010 it costs a lot of money to run a school
10011 the fact is were doing it and not only are we doing it but in academics were really on top of things youre not going to a second class school because it is free
10012 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic the way they acted was extraordinary
10013 described as a man in his late teens or early 20s
10014 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
10015 i actually wonder if the republicans had a crew on the scene to capture just the right angles for instance the identical camera placement shooting the speaker over the shoulder at stage right
10016 under no circumstances may a candidate receive approval to make a campaign or election related statement or to respond to a campaign or election related media query
10017 the candidate may appear on camera and in photographs as an official participant and may make a statement or answer questions about the official business being conducted
10018 we need to eliminate 15 million federal non military government positions now tell these parasites to go get real jobs and get off our backs
10019 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city the journey that led me here is improbable my mother was born in the heartland of america but my father grew up herding goats in kenya his father my grandfather was a cook a domestic servant to the british
10020 obama worried gop will inject race into campaign at florida fund raiser in june
10021 oh it wasnt the race card at all he was trying to say they will say hes a hack and it just came out wrong
10022 the only one talking about race is obama he is the racist
10023 the focus and commitment that will build this bridge needs to be transferred to our nations crumbling infrastructure
10024 if we continue with business as usual we will see more bridges collapse more bridges close more gridlock and the economy will suffer the quality of life will suffer and we wont be able to compete in the 21st century
10025 i dont think any governor wants to be in this situation
10026 the difference between obama and osama is just a little b
10027 he wants the cuts to take effect immediately they would show up in pay checks at the end of august
10028 and they thought that gray davis was bad didnt the governator use davis budget crisis as a means to oust him and force an election
10029 the part time worker move could be a false economy if theyre in prisons and hospitals
10030 an apology is long overdue for the atrocities of slavery but it is pure politics and symbolism without a plan that addresses the many people who continue to live without a proper education health care and economic stability
10031 i find it very interesting that mr cohen would call for a national apology during a heated election when he clearly needs african american votes for over 20 years while serving in the tennessee general assembly he never thought to ask the state of tennessee for an apology not once
10032 i just know it was the right thing to do
10033 house of representatives issues apology to black americans for slavery
10034 i am sorry that someone i never knew did something bad to someone you never knew and then did not pay that person for work he she may or may not have done
10035 we dare not invade the united states there will be a rifle behind every blade of grass
10036 dogs on the street pumas on your feet how cues in the environment influence product evaluation and choice
10037 seeing dogs is not going to cause people to leap out of their chairs and go buy 10 pairs of puma sneakers
10038 marketers always think if they want a product to catch on they have to think up a catchy slogan or come up with a slick advertisement to create a buzz
10039 we think of advertising as a way to remind people of products putting up more ads should increase sales but we should also think about linking products to the environment and let the environment do the work for us
10040 researchers have argued that consumer behavior is strongly influenced by subtle environmental cues
10041 although the mars bar takes its name from the company founder and not from earths neighboring planet consumers apparently responded to news about the planet mars by purchasing more mars bars
10042 this was a lucky turn of events for the candy company but what does it mean for understanding consumer choice
10043 our results demonstrate that the prevalence of environmental cues as simple as color can affect product accessibility even in noisy real world consumer environments
10044 exposure to a colored pen led participants to choose more products of that same color
10045 live the healthy way eat five fruits and veggies a day
10046 each and every dining hall tray needs five fruits and veggies a day
10047 we theorized that this differential cueing by the environment would cause participants who were exposed to trays in their daily environment to consume more fruits and vegetables
10048 those who were cued by the environment ate 25 more fruits and vegetables
10049 there is a lot of effort put into telling people to eat five a day
10050 people need to remember the information at the time when the relevant behavior is taking place
10051 although catchiness may indeed be important marketers should also pay greater attention to whether their slogans and products will be cued by the environment
10052 finding ways to sell more coke if we can get college students to eat more fruits and vegetables thats a good thing
10053 cats and dogs have a strong cognitive association in memory because of their many feature similarities as domestic pets
10054 our findings show that cue exposure can affect attitudes not only toward the exposed object but also toward any object that shares a conceptual relationship
10055 in addition to relying on existing conceptual relationships the data indicate that marketers can create novel links between their product and a commonly encountered feature in the consumer environment
10056 conceptual priming effects can have a strong impact on real world consumer judgments
10057 priming effects can emerge without deliberate learning and can occur outside of conscious awareness
10058 well its not as if mccain has any good or nice qualities that republicans who have so betrayed the country and stolen it blind even dare show their face in public is only due to that the media is owned by them a real free press would long ago have exposed republican vice and crime in high places instead of wondering what could be wrong
10059 the only change you will get with the democrats is the change left in your pocket
10060 the district shares the concern of the parents and students and extends an apology to those who were subjected to this experience in an effort to address this matter with the teacher and to express our displeasure regarding this act we have recommended disciplinary action
10061 in order not to violate the teachers rights to confidentiality we are not able to provide further details in this matter nevertheless we have deemed this as an issue that deserves our immediate attention and have responded accordingly
10062 thats when they began to make fun of each other
10063 this is just ignorant it shows that not only is there a need to educate our students but we need to better educate our teachers
10064 i want to try to figure out what i need to do there might be some kind of miracle a glimmer of hope what if i go out there to throw and dont feel anything for whatever reason if thats the case i wouldnt have the surgery

10069 i threw a pitch and it kind of felt weird

10098 the restaurants owners hired andersen consulting to revamp all our processes after several months of analysis they concluded that the spoon was the most frequently dropped piece of cutlery it represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour if our staff are better prepared we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man hours per shift
10099 ill get another spoon next time i go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now

10121 the hope of some scientists is that they might be able to harness stem cells and program them to generate pluripotent stem cell lines capable of differentiating into many different types of cells which have the genes of patients
10122 this would open up the possibility of producing a large supply of immune matched cells to that patient that could be used in transplantation methodologies
10123 the other hope and one thats much closer upon us is if you could produce the cell types that become sick in that person you might be able to use them in the laboratory to come to understand basic aspects of the disease and take the study of disease out of patients where its very difficult and put it into the petri dish
10124 we dont at all fully understand als and it is our lack of understanding of that disease process which we believe is preventing us from developing more effective treatments
10125 because the disease process is happening in the spinal cord in the central nervous system of patients we dont at all have access to living examples of the neurons that are undergoing the disease process no way could we go to als patients and take samples of their motor neurons
10126 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
10127 irans leaders would do well to rethink their gamble and suspend their nuclear program barring this the best they could hope for is that israels conventional air assault will destroy their nuclear facilities to be sure this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation but the alternative is an iran turned into a nuclear wasteland

10138 there were attacks that targeted senior officers and we thank god they failed and our colleagues are safe
10139 investigations are still ongoing to see who was behind the attacks and it is too early to point out motives although they appeared to be of al qaeda style
10140 o n monday morning jul 21 we were startled by an explosion in the house of colonel issa al issawi who is known as the leader of the campaign against militants in fallujah and surroundings house
10141 to our surprise the explosion took place on the roof where at least four guards were posted
10142 one of them was warning his colleagues that the other was a suicide attacker and asking them to take cover then another policeman fired towards both of them
10143 all of us ran away and then the second bomb went off many policemen were killed and injured in the two blasts these have again ended our dreams of security
10144 col issawi has been a police officer for over 20 years meaning he is one of saddam husseins officers who agreed to continue although the country was occupied by the americans
10145 people of fallujah know that he helped al qaeda worked with the islamic party and now is the right arm of the american occupation
10146 we knew that many of the members of the awakening forces were members of al qaeda
10147 it was said that about 100 young men were executed inside fallujah police station by the awakening militias in january and february 2007 it became clear later that the executioners were fallujah police leaders following orders issued by the u s military from the headquarters next door
10148 it seems that we iraqis will all kill each other as long as this u s occupation is paying our leaders to widen the gap between us

10180 the support for the project has been overwhelming with very few negative incidents to date which demonstrates that by and large canadians are tolerant and respectful
10181 but despite our best efforts to educate canadians about the importance of equality and diversity intolerance and hatred persist which is precisely why we need this museum
10182 a death threat is just deplorable and unfortunately it comes in the aftermath of the other swastika incident in winnipeg
10183 we have to come together and fight this kind of hate
10184 ioc officials negotiated with the chinese so that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
10185 i regret that it now appears bocog beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad has announced that there will be limitations on web site access during games time
10186 if a few web sites are difficult to browse its mainly because they have spread content that is banned by the chinese laws
10187 the internet is regulated according to law in china just like in other countries
10188 the channel is smooth for foreign journalists in beijing to report the games and report china using the internet
10189 coming just nine days before the opening ceremony this is yet another provocation by the chinese authorities this situation increases our concern that there will be many cases of censorship during the games we condemn the iocs failure to do anything about this and we are more than sceptical about its ability to ensure that the media are able to report freely
10190 the chinese governments controls on the internet are contrary to the free reporting environment promised by the hosts and contradict international olympic commission assurances that the press will be able to operate as at previous games thousands of visiting journalists will now get to experience the censorship that reporters and other internet users in china have to put up with every day
10191 we were satisfied by the assurances we received across a number of areas media service levels including internet access brand protection environmental contingency plans for improved air quality and the live broadcast feed
10192 over the past 3 decades the us economy has gone through 3 recessions according to nber in each of those 3 recessions there was a string of job losses that lasted for a minimum of 10 months

10195 the fact that a piece of luggage with bomb clearly written on it has been able to get into the baggage make up area of a secure airport in this country is just another slap in the face for aviation workers and the travelling public
10196 emirates is looking at 450 aircraft by 2020 so thats why were building the new terminal 50 of the aircraft at the airport are currently emirates and thatll be 70 by 2010
10197 in 2007 we reached our goal of 34 million passengers
10198 weve dedicated a completely separate area for the f amp j passenger where the passenger can check in and get to an aircraft within ten to 15 minutes on a fast track and they do not mix with the economy passengers at any point of time
10199 we dont foresee emirates moving to jebel ali jxb they in fact will remain in dubai and they will hopefully occupy the whole airport in the next four to five years

10202 the tourism industry has evolved considerably over the last decade and is continuing to do so and its important that young people who are thinking about entering the industry workplace are fully aware of all the issues as and when they happen im extremely honoured to have been asked to join the industry advisory board and am looking forward to helping make a real difference to the industrys future leaders
10203 as the head of one of the worlds leading global airlines in australia im confident rogers breadth and depth of knowledge gleaned from many years experience will be a very valuable asset to the board we work hard to bring academia closer to the day to day developments of the industry and help foster a greater understanding of the threats and opportunities now facing travel tourism and hospitality management
10204 it is wonderful to see roger as an extremely experienced airline executive contributing significantly to the university particularly on current topical and important issues our faculty and students have access to a wide range of experienced tourism personalities and advice so the transition from academic studies to industry employment is made more interesting and productive
10205 well to meet this budget crisis well have to lay off 10 of our fire fighers and the mayors office remodel so we need that budget increase

10207 with all the names available in the dictionary another could have been used
10208 we are investigating to see what our options are and this has come from members who are also worried about confusion in the mind of consumers
10209 people consistently tell us that our tanks tales and tastings sessions are the best brewery tour theyve ever done
10210 im sure its because they get such an up close encounter with the brewing equipment and get to spend an hour with one of the people who actually makes the beer
10211 i am delighted to welcome john to the new role his comprehensive experience and passion for cruising will be an asset to the company
10212 the australian market is strategically important to uniworld and there is plenty of scope for growth which presents wonderful opportunities
10213 our investment into the expanded team is an accurate indication of just how well business has been since our entrance into the australian market
10214 the reading was well below the magic point of 50 which indicates growth and it was the second such month weve had of negative growth for the industry
10215 they need to find where the hot spots are they need to find the pathways and we can tell them if they ask us
10216 its the dust off the uncovered stag heaps its the stacks themselves its the trucks themselves that have lead on them when they leave the site
10217 this will be sampling all day every day with data going up hourly all day every day
10218 its the government that needs to come clean and tell us what it is
10219 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
10220 its going to be a modern day willy wonka factory
10221 this strong growth is proof that the new faster and more intuitive model we launched in may has already hit the right note with australian travellers
10222 over 100 travel sites from all over the world already partner with wego
10223 based on the success of this years event we are expecting a record number of space bookings to be made during the priority booking period
10224 new initiatives for aime 2009 include two entry exits to provide better visitor flow an extension of the popular networking hours introduced last year and a new floor plan
10225 we have also retained the policy of fully hosting all buyers that qualify to attend aime the successful two way online diary and the function free tuesday night
10226 while we still do not anticipate a recovery of the housing market in the near term we believe we are appropriately reserved at this time
10227 last quarter we announced we were focused on near term strategies related to credit costs and capital and we made significant progress in all three areas
10228 we addressed credit challenges head on we were successful in cutting compensation and benefits expenses during the second quarter and the infusion of 600 million in new capital strengthens our balance sheet and reinforced our strong liquidity position
10229 the cost of operating to darwin is the highest of any airport on the entire tiger airways network
10230 this is an important point to stress combined airport and fuel costs in darwin cost more than any of the 27 airports that the airline serves across australia and asia it is just incompatible for a true low fare airline to operate to such a high cost destination
10231 also everyones waiting on the imminent launch of a secondary hub for tiger
10232 there is an element of competition because we have passengers on the central coast who now have a choice where previously there wasnt a real choice because the services out of newcastle werent there
10233 we do offer something which is very different to sydney based on the low cost model we also supplement what happens in sydney for people who are looking to get to the hunter valley
10234 weve also had interest from the likes of airasiax and before jetstar announced that they were looking to fly between sydney and kuala lumpur we provided a viable opportunity for airasiax to consider the sydney market
10235 moving forward we need to make sure that should those opportunities arise again we have the infrastructure to handle it up to this stage it hasnt been
10236 capacity to the east coast is therefore maintained and passengers from melbourne will have an improved product melbourne will become our hub in the east coast of australia
10237 from the 15th of december 2008 to 26th of january 2009 the flight will exceptionally be operated via sydney in order to meet peak demand

10244 it has dented my reputation quite seriously people take me at my word so i expect the information i am giving to be consistent
10245 i am disappointed because i have learned in corporate life that you dont deliver surprises to constituents and the media is a key constituent at the olympics
10246 i believed we would stick to the agreement that is what we have done at different games held in all sorts of societies i thought china would judge it was in their interests if they shifted fine but tell us

10250 but if i listened to commentators instead of doing what i think is right then id be losing objectivity
10251 i am absolutely determined with everything ive ever done in my life to see it through and i will lead us through to the next election

10256 until the fires extinguished we cant do our full examination and obviously that will be limited by whats left at that stage
10257 i have been down this road before and came through unscathed
10258 something just isnt right about that person i dont know what it is but something is off

10291 but i can certainly help her reach one of the goals she had before she died to make sure chasing rainbows reaches young adults throughout bc canada the us and the rest of the world our hope saras and mine has always been that the film can be used to raise public awareness of the unique challenges facing young adults living with cancer they need help to address their needs which are not only medical but also financial logistical and emotional both in the short and long term i will continue to do what i can to make that happen
10292 we are at war and operations tempo is very high
10293 ive tasked the a1 manpower and personnel staff to go on the road to gain the vital perspective necessary to develop viable solutions for the field a1 has the opportunity to implement positive change for commanders and airmen by streamlining unit programs and administrative processes thereby enhancing commanders ability to lead and execute their mission
10294 this is a balancing act and we work with multiple agencies to determine what type of support they need from us
10295 downsizing typically occurs when our partner agencies believe they can manage the fires still burning with the civilian air and ground assets they have available
10296 we have six aircraft still supporting active missions but well have about four additional aircraft available that will serve as alert aircraft able to launch if needed
10297 the out of state units showed up and were eager to help out with the mission so were sending them out
10298 this is a great opportunity for us and them since they are getting some hands on experience fighting the fires helping out california and also giving our aircrews a chance to breathe
10299 we got here july 16 and completed our training so now were ready to get out there and help
10300 we almost got to launch twice yesterday but firefighters in the area were able to gain control of the situation quickly
10301 its been remarkable to take so many aircraft from different states bring them to california and train and utilize them
10302 this is a first an historic event and weve built a template showing that allegiances like this are critical i think from this we can actually work toward a national standard for emergency response
10303 this conference is a key element in air forces southerns engagement efforts throughout the region
10304 this event is an opportunity to connect directly with central american air chiefs while discussing issues affecting our air forces in this region of u s southern commands area of responsibility
10305 the overall result of the conference was a resounding success as all the objectives were met
10306 the air chiefs in attendance were pleased with the conference because it allowed for a free flow exchange of ideas they thanked lt gen seip and maj gen morrow for their hospitality and their efforts to move forward with the meetings planned objectives
10307 were providing weather impacts to the jtf commander so he can have an idea of what operations in the joint operating area might be affected said capt
10308 part of our job is to coordinate one forecast for the joint operations area
10309 from the metoc perspective you become a more well rounded team with each service bringing different but complementary skill sets
10310 the navy brings a certain set of skills dealing with maritime operations
10311 on the flip side the air force has more experience with ground operations since they work more with the army and special operations
10312 it definitely adds a different perspective to work with the air force
10313 we go to school with them but this is my first time deployed with them
10314 ive never done weather at the operational level of war
10315 my forecasts contribute to the top echelon of mission planning
10316 the last thing you want is a tactical level weather team where someone is briefing no go weather and were up here briefing the admiral that everything is good
10317 i learn a lot from my air force colleagues some different forecasting techniques
10318 working with them ive picked up a few new tricks of the trade so to speak and i hope ive imparted the same to them
10319 this is a major staff sustainment exercise concerning our ability to operate as a jtf
10320 we do exercises like this since we are a u s joint forces command designated jtf capable headquarters and we report as such through the defense readiness reporting system said navy capt steven zaricor cjtf 950 director of operations
10321 this was a pretty complex ambitious exercise considering this was a major certification exercise for the carrier strike group expeditionary strike group and for second fleet
10322 at the operational level of war its important to fuse all effects you have to pool all services and abilities to have a jtf with expertise and command and control to effectively fight a joint war
10323 i was impressed with what they were able to do
10324 if you need to get a staff forward with no footprint you can reach back to your main support in the rear
10325 i think we had a good solid joint team both here and back at norfolk
10326 an obvious advantage to this is the admiral can be here with a large part of his staff while back in virginia a large group is getting work done in support of expeditionary operations
10327 its a challenge definitely one of the big learning points is how to do distributive ops and weve demonstrated we can do it
10328 working in a joint arena makes it more difficult but once you get the processes and procedures its easier people brought a lot of experience to this exercise
10329 having these guys bring the expertise that a navy centric staff doesnt have pays big dividends
10330 we have some very talented mid grade officer majors lieutenant colonel types and we plug them into key billets in our staff
10331 the biggest advantage of having interaction with the other services is seeing how other services operate
10332 the great part is everyone understands there are different cultures and works together to bridge that gap
10333 combined joint and interagency operations are here to stay the more we can learn about each others culture service and history the better prepared we will be to defend american interests and freedom when required

10339 some 440 offenders and 28 staff members have been affected by a confirmed norovirus
10340 speaks of the level of the figure of the pope today in the world how is it possible to be absent from where he is what if something happens or he does something unscheduled
10341 the presence of the journalists in these two weeks at tranquil bressanone is one more proof of the anticipation for everything that the pope does or says an anticipation that doesnt end even when the situation brings discouragement
10342 there is little to spy on from the other side of the wall of the black canvas they have put up to protect benedicts walks in the garden of the seminary but we are prepared for whatever could be necessary
10343 what i would like to say to the holy father is that at present damascus is the capital of arab culture and at the same time the capital of the year of st paul
10344 i will be exceedingly happy if the holy father decides to accept our invitation to visit syria in this year
10345 culture of the spirit whether christian or muslim confers on humanity its moral dimension
10346 the vatican might play a role in planting the flower of peace in the middle east
10347 deep down among religious intellectuals there is no quarrel but dialogue and discussion
10348 and i hope that the holy father will play a fundamental part in the peace of the world
10349 the vatican had a fundamental role in the fall of the berlin wall
10350 and i hope it will be able to play a similar role to demolish the wall being built in the land of peace
10351 that the human family may know how to respect gods design for the world and thus become ever more aware of the great gift of god which creation represents for us
10352 that the answer of the entire people of god to the common vocation to sanctity and mission may be promoted and fostered with careful discernment of the charisms and a constant commitment to spiritual and cultural formation
10353 the bombs of ahmedabad and bangalore are an attack on the social harmony of the whole of india carried out by fanatics who cause death and devastation
10354 the catholic church in india energetically condemns this senseless violence having placed her own means immediately at the disposal of the victims
10355 t hese odious attacks are an attempt to divide the country and create a sense of insecurity and fear among the people
10356 however we saw people from all communities run immediately to help the victims with a human solidarity that has prevailed over the attempt to spread panic
10357 the purpose of the bombs is obvious to destabilize a situation that is already quite unsettled clearly this is the way to interpret such an incident a day before the decision
10358 the appeal we can launch is of little value as we are not such a representative reality
10359 nevertheless the appeal is made to enable democracy to prevail in this country
10360 are linked to positions of power there is a need to safeguard secularism and at the same time the right to give this secularism a democratic expression democracy always represents risks but there are no alternatives to democracy
10361 the situation in turkey has remained in this immobility until now precisely because of the opposition between the forces of power it is a bit like pulling a rope in which neither party is able to prevail so things remain stuck in the middle
10362 saw a great need for comprehensive marriage preparation that spanned a weekend
10363 though it is more social and not as intense at the three to get married weekend
10364 ongoing guidance at least in the first 10 years is of the utmost importance
10365 my husband and i have been married three and a half years
10366 but i can definitely say despite a very happy marriage we need lots of support and guidance all young married couples need guidance because it is hard and guidance from a priest or from another more experienced couple can really help you persevere
10367 in marriage two people meld two lives into one and we need as much prayer and support as we can get it is important to hear over and over again that the most joy will come from what seems the most challenging giving yourself for your spouse and for your children
10368 most parishes offer bible classes catechesis and mens and womens groups you dont often see programs specifically for couples to build marriages
10369 i believe this is where the laity need to get involved according to vatican ii we are called to get involved and support our pastors he cant do it all
10370 couples that are living marriages faithful to the teachings of the church need to be out there supporting one another and boldly proclaiming the truth about marriage that is the goal of three to stay married an environment where young couples can get started on the right foot in living the churchs teachings and sharing that message with other married couples who may need support
10371 we have to get involved and support our priests by living and preaching the truth
10372 as many famous spiritual writers have said we prepare for the business or professional world with years of study but somehow we embark on the most important decision of our life marriage and the spouse we choose with little to no reflection
10373 i think a weekend for marriage preparation although even too short for such an important decision is the only way to make it as comprehensive as possible it is difficult to live a catholic marriage in our society today so sufficient preparation is essential but unfortunately it is missing in some dioceses due to a lack of resources support or simple man power
10374 our task in the three to get married program is to impart to participants what it means to be married in the church and what that entails in their daily married life
10375 even for couples who are there simply because they want the traditional church ceremony if they are sincere find that they can glean useful information from the weekend and may even have a change of heart or conversion by the end
10376 the human but more importantly the spiritual transformation of the couples participating cannot be underestimated on these weekends
10377 one of the big issues of sexual ethics is that of family planning
10378 three to get married covers the church teaching on natural family planning and birth control and several of the other talks cover treating your spouse respectfully in the sexual act making it an act of mutual love and not simply self serving
10379 we live in a culture where the catholic ideal of marriage being a gift of self and being open to life are often challenged by society and even family
10380 when a couple is constantly challenged on the way in which they are living their lives they need support and they do not always get it from family
10381 meeting and knowing other couples who are striving for the same goals as you can really help
10382 in memory of my fellow priests who died in dachau for we must never forget what happened there and in many similar places
10383 none of us was ever able to say why the clergy block experienced this catastrophe or to what it was due some people said that the pope had given a strong speech on the radio and that the german bishops issued a public protest
10384 there was a reason behind it the vatican radio station had broadcast a critical report about dachau and protested the mistreatment of priests
10385 he is in an expansive mood and talks at me without letup for the entire trip about the coming victory and ruling the world and how the church will be destroyed
10386 lets forget what happened in the past i was wrong it turns out that the ones who hold out and behave best are you padres
10387 throughout those years of horror when we listened to radio vatican and to the popes messages we felt in communion with the pope in helping persecuted jews and in fighting nazi violence
10388 yet we must forgive we must forgive while remaining conscious of the full horror of what occurred not only because nothing constructive can be built on a foundation of hatred neither a new europe nor a new world but above all for the sake of him who commands and urges us to forgive and before whom we victims and executioners alike are all poor debtors in need of mercy
10389 but when he disembarked he found that a large crowd was waiting for him when he disembarked and saw the vast crowd his heart was moved with pity for them and he cured their sick
10390 when it was evening the disciples approached him and said this is a deserted place and it is already late dismiss the crowds so that they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves
10391 jesus said to them there is no need for them to go away give them some food yourselves but they said to him five loaves and two fish are all we have here
10392 then he said bring them here to me and he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven he said the blessing broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples who in turn gave them to the crowds
10393 they all ate and were satisfied and they picked up the fragments left over twelve wicker baskets full those who ate were about five thousand men not counting women and children
10394 taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven he said the blessing broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples
10395 our world has grown weary of greed exploitation and division of the tedium of false idols and piecemeal responses and the pain of false promises
10396 this is the work of the holy spirit this is the hope held out by the gospel of jesus christ it is to bear witness to this reality that you were created anew at baptism and strengthened through the gifts of the spirit at confirmation let this be the message that you bring from sydney to the world

10403 further just as one more example my colleague professor erlendur haraldsson of rekjavik university who investigated the sai movement and alleged miracles very widely in the 1970s though without controlled scientific results was repeatedly told of sai babas sexual interest in boys and young men and refers to some of these in his book modern miracles
10404 repeatedly told of sai babas sexual interest in boys and young men
10405 refer to some of these stories in his book modern miracles
10406 dr narasimhaiah i dont think we can find anything substantial there otherwise i would certainly have used that material against sai baba according to dr narasimhaiah there was nothing in the letters indicating fraud by baba
10407 professor erlendur haraldsson who my wife and i have known since 1989 and who still visits us has still not been able to get any evidence of endless vibuthi supplies despite decades of interest in the matter
10408 had a lot of anecdotal evidence but was not able to test the reality of the vibuthi phenomena under controlled conditions

10413 whoever was involved in that shift in position should have made it known to the international media i should have been informed too
10414 we should not have surprised the international media on the eve of the olympics
10415 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
10416 i think weve put the district into the position of where we really can get into a path of continuous improvement
10417 nothings going to change immediately overnight but we are certainly heading in the right direction
10418 these results were good and we should be proud of them
10419 but were still a long way from what our objective is to make sure that this is the best big city school district in the country
10420 its hard to keep consistency that you need over a period of time
10421 it exhausts the people in our schools to adjust to new superintendents
10422 lincolns had a pretty bad rap there for a lot of years
10423 over the last three years we definitely had a different focus instructionally and also school culture wise across the district
10424 but i also believe in what were trying to accomplish
10425 i think its just kind of like what were doing at lincoln were just barely scratching the surface
10426 this is aimed at developers looking to deploy across multiple screens looking to leverage the java ubiquity
10427 our strength comes from the ubiquity of the java runtime in the mobile area where we are pervasive and in the six million java developers who can extend their capabilities to provide web resident apps and can do it in a faster time frame
10428 we are architecting it to the idea of cross device content where developers can build applications to a common api and if you write to that your app is deployable to any device capable of running javafx
10429 we initially thought flash flex would be easier to start with but in the end it was harder to do certain functions
10430 javafx gives us the advantage of tying into those tried and true java apis that are vital to our app so while the tools are lacking they are going to be there

10460 adding insult to injury it appears you are wading into this debate on very shaky procedural and legal grounds
10461 your continued pursuit of this matter suggests that you are making not only a poor policy judgment but a poor legal one as well
10462 your heavy handed attempts to inject the fcc into the middle of that process threaten to hijack the evolution of the internet to everyones detriment
10463 it will also deter the very investment we need for the internet to continue growing to meet the increasing demands being placed on it

10469 i couldnt grasp how anyone was alive it was just quiet peaceful thoughtful and reflective
10470 have you actually realized the truth of impermanence have you so integrated it with your every thought breath and movement that your life has been transformed ask yourself these two questions do i remember at every moment i am dying and that everyone and everything else is and so treat all beings at all times with compassion has my understanding of death and impermanence becomes so keen and so urgent that i am devoting every second to the purpose of enlightenment if you can answer yes to both of these then you have really understood impermanence

10478 there is an economic downturn affecting the whole of the uk edinburgh is no exception
10479 there is a common misconception that edinburgh in august is fully booked and were trying to spread the message that there is still plenty of opportunity for people to enjoy the citys fabulous festivals
10480 ive certainly never heard of visitscotland doing anything like this in august before
10481 i know bookings are well down although the industry is pretty confident it will recover through last minute bookings
10482 its pretty unheard of for so much accommodation to be available and theres no denying things have been slow

10500 jokes have varied over the years with some taking the question and answer format while others are witty proverbs or riddles
10501 what they all share however is a willingness to deal with taboos and a degree of rebellion
10502 believe it or not this place has a lot in common with the moon
10503 mainly weve got slopes soft soils and wide open spaces
10504 if you know the problem is there you can start addressing the problem
10505 it significantly impairs your ability to stay independent which is what people want
10506 it was something that has kind of been on my mind in general and once i started looking at balance it became very clear it would have applications in that direction
10507 gospel aerobics is where we come together and exercise to present our bodies as temples to god
10508 our bodies house the holy spirit so we want to take very good care of our temples so we can live long prosperous and healthy lives

10515 the holiday keeps shoppers from going to texas but with gas prices the way they are it will be good for us
10516 we have a huge inventory of boots and most marked down to 75 so they qualify for tax free
10517 i think high gas prices will keep people here then they can save gas and money too

10524 we sent you to office you have benefits we will only dream of at a price we can only dream of
10525 a lot of the focus was lost on other issues
10526 it could have been more concentrated on just getting us out of the war
10527 we call it a protest but we do it in the way that the government says were allowed to
10528 the problem is in order for that change in government to get done people need to stop worrying so much about themselves
10529 a protest would be getting all the people there to block a bunch of streets in order to shut stuff down in a peaceful way
10530 if youre into politics at all while youre young you should experience at least one big war protest
10531 the march on saturday sept 29 was a departure in tone and make up from many past anti war demonstrations it was a serious and highly successful effort to involve more community based organizations and issues and to link the struggle against the war with the struggles against racism oppression and economic injustice at home
10532 on the 29th of september the campaign against the war in occupied iraq once again took to the streets
10533 apparently troops out now understands that this is not just about iraq the same regime that wages war on the people of iraq is also the regime that sponsors gentrification in our cities and the wholesale incarceration of african american youth the vicious fascist crackdown on latin immigrants and so many other evils all this noise can certainly be heard in central cell block where prisoners are being held
10534 solidarity with the historic iraqi resistance who are on the frontlines of the fight against our common enemy which is u s imperialism

10556 por otro lado confirmamos que la mayor a de los beb s prematuros sin discapacidades ten an un buen funcionamiento adulto
10557 un estudio que se est haciendo sobre ni os nacidos en noruega en 1999 2000 registr una tasa de supervivencia a los 5 a os de edad del 80 por ciento entre los beb s con 23 27 semanas de gestaci n un aumento significativo comparado con el 20 por ciento de nuestro estudio
10558 lamentablemente las tasas de par lisis cerebral en ambos estudios son parecidas

10560 the dog and cat population problem we have in san felipe exists everywhere in baja just like all third world countries the sooner we can get our animal population under control and educate the locals the sooner we can address issues such as annual vaccine programs and treatment of mange dogs cats puppies and kittens should not have to suffer needlessly but we need shoes that we can turn into surgeries
10561 others that have been doing this work tell us that when we have surgiccally altered 75 of the existing animal population we will achieve zero additional growth what a concept shoes for spays

10565 i regret that it now appears that bocog has announced that there will be limitations on website access during games time
10566 i also now understand that some ioc officials negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis that they were not considered games related
10567 its just one more example that shows how the chinese governments commitment in 2001 to allow free media was just a weak promise and in some ways they had no real intention to provide normal working conditions for journalists covering the games
10568 if journalists access to the internet is restricted in any way its a failure of both parties to meet the promises they made to the world
10569 i dont think the ioc knew who they were getting into bed with

10578 the place and role of sufism in the islamic world
10579 spiritual and moral ideals of sufism are directly connected with the acknowledgment of monotheism with the perception of the multitudinous attributes of the most high with spiritual perfection with the purification of a believers heart from evil with condemnation of luxury and social injustice with equality and human brotherhood
10580 for many muslim peoples spiritual knowledge of sufism is part of their culture
10581 establishment of tolerant relations between people and helps to block radical and extremist developments
10582 the conference was an important event to unite all healthy elements of the traditional islam that opposes radical islamic distortions of the true faith
10583 nothing like this will ever be built again if you tear it down its lost forever
10584 if you tear it down all you have is waste and memories
10585 then i heard the sirens i knew something was going on
10586 it is close to a park where we do our walking
10587 no other al contenders sans tampa and toronto would require the dh services that griffey could offer
10588 absolutely if there was a position either secretary of state or secretary of defense i think that he would jump at the opportunity to serve his country in either of those capacities maybe un ambassador is a third possibility but certainly theres no question in my mind that he would love to have an opportunity to do any of those jobs and quite frankly i think he believes hed do a great job with of them
10589 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
10590 yes you are any boy would be lucky to have you as a girlfriend
10591 oh just the fact that my boyfriend was voted off
10592 how could you vote max off they were a cute couple
10593 yeah so gross that i almost threw up and besides that perv was going to be voted off sooner or later
10594 but he was alices pain honey and you had no right to try and break them up
10595 oh not much im just here to ask alice how it feels to have her heart broken two times
10596 well just to let you know your dad and noha voted with me

10604 i promise to love you forever every single day of forever will you marry me
10605 the record is called departure for a number of reasons
10606 there have been departures in my career in my personal life
10607 when it was time to do my third album i wanted people to see another side of me
10608 its about who we are as people and our personal lives things weve gone through in the past 12 months
10609 maybe shes at a party and you feel that immediate connection you both know its there
10610 basically its about a girl that has a gallery of hearts
10611 a little bit longer and ill be fine waitin on a cure but none of them are sure
10612 i was having one of those days where i was discouraged so i went into this empty hotel ballroom and wrote this song
10613 nick sings this song every night and it brings people to tears its amazing
10614 delivers the sort of intelligent melodic pop music that ought to be a staple of radio playlists
10615 lush instrumental flourishes intriguing sound bites and naturalistic found sounds
10616 soulful voice experimental instrumentation and an encyclopedic knowledge of pop music
10617 nine of the ten songs on misadventures in stereo deal with some type of loss loss of a loved one loss of control loss of love loss of power the list goes on
10618 writing and recording these songs gave me an outlet for processing those things but also provided moments of hope and perseverance as well
10619 i went for the qualities that i loved about my favorite 60s and 70s records
10620 they werent perfect but they were all about the feel of the performances whether it moved you was much more important than if that note was a tiny bit flat or that snare hit didnt line up exactly on the beat
10621 no i co tak stoisz z rozdziawionymi ustami czy by nigdy jeszcze nie widzia a kruka w pancerzu bojowym

10639 with this legislation we will install an impressive number of health care reforms
10640 its not the absolute ban that we had started with but its a good middle ground
10641 we need to do something about transparency about eliminating inefficiencies in the health care system
10642 this bill will go a long way toward accomplishing that
10643 there was no weapon present and no danger to the public

10645 a lot of the cuts were made in nokias music portfolio which is its mid tier thats a particularly competitive segment there have been some new products from sony ericsson and really it is nokia pinpointing particular competitors
10646 nokia has always been extremely tactical with its pricing pinpointing sweet spots in different segments of the market and making adjustments to wrongfoot competitors
10647 nokia remains the unassailable leader in the mobile phone market this quarter only served to further underline its dominance we expect nokia to get even stronger in the second half worsening market conditions could serve to strengthen nokias market share given the resilience afforded by its strong brand substantial global footprint and immense economies of scale
10648 lg and motorola have said their third quarter will be down sony ericsson has said it continues to have issues while samsung saw sales down in q2 the third quarter might be a little bit more challenging than people were expecting due to the economic situation and delays in products
10649 they have managed to hang on to more market share than we expected and managed to do it without cutting prices too much
10650 i think they have hit bottom not improving much but not free falling but if nokia is cutting prices then it is bad for everybody including motorola

10657 after seven years of a go it alone presidency perhaps i should expect nothing more from this white house but this order will be binding on future administrations as well for that reason we must conduct effective oversight so that we can advise the next president of whether this order should remain in effect or should be repealed

10665 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
10666 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
10667 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
10668 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
10669 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
10670 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
10671 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime
10672 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible
10673 what is it with you british and jo pavey jo pavey

10677 most of the hacks in the book are answers to questions or problems people have had when using their apple products
10678 one of my favorite hacks is from a contributor rich lefko after he left a job he wanted to keep his work data he used a pc at work without having to buy a windows pc richs hack was brilliant he discovered a way to swap out the hard drive of the macbook and install the hard drive from work and boot into windows so now on the rare occasions he wants a windows machine he just switches out the drive in his macbook
10679 starting salaries do not tell you a whole lot but there is a real divergence in dollar terms as you go over the course of a career
10680 we are obviously pleased but certainly not surprised to see that our former students fare so well in the marketplace
10681 its certainly gratifying to see that employers recognize the value of a texas a amp m degree and the contributions our graduates bring to their firms
10682 a lot of the unusual phenomena that deals with animal esp can be explained as something else
10683 humans and animals may or not may have esp but the scientific proof is still not there yet
10684 but what they are feeling are actually pre tremors and the ground moving they can detect it before we can because they feel it
10685 in places where tremors dont occur often its been noted that animals dont seem to sense what is coming
10686 animals get skittish before a storm because they can feel the barometric pressure changing or they can smell the ozone or even hear the distant thunder
10687 its common for animals to sense a seizure in their owners and some dogs can even be trained to warn a person of an impending seizure
10688 dogs are very aware of what is normal and not normal behavior in their owners they can sense the muscles tightening up and the oncoming of spasms and other things that might signal the onset of a seizure dogs are great about reading body language of their owners and can sense a shift change in people
10689 its in their animal nature to save the pack and pets consider their owners as part of their animal pack
10690 what they are doing in a case like a fire is showing concern for their own pack members which happen to be people
10691 first can the animal detect it the high pitch sound or strong smell and second is it motivated to do anything about it if the animal is not motivated it goes on about its business
10692 theres a lot we dont understand about the sensory capabilities of animals
10693 but before you can begin to talk about esp you have to eliminate all the other factors and when you do you usually find the reason to explain an action the animal makes

10705 the pollution from driving a lamborghini is bad enough but flying one thousands of miles for a service is taking climate wrecking behaviour to new heights

10712 we did decide for a lot of reasons that we wanted to just push hard for doing doom internally
10713 the doors not completely shut for another quake project and i would say that probably the success of quake live will determine whether we do another quake project
10714 right now the publishers arent all that interested in a multiplayer focused game on there
10715 and theyre probably right quake for this coming year is quake live
10716 it would have to be a 60hz fast action game
10717 were probably going to be making some moves to do some iphone development
10718 we have two different projects that are at least vaguely in the works for the iphone
10719 theyll make nice with me when they want me to come out and do a keynote
10720 im really saddened that we dont have an iphone product out now because i think apple is doing so many things well right now and i think theyre going to be a really positive force

10724 i can tell you there will be guns i can tell you there will be blood i can tell you there will be demons i can tell you there will be gibs in other words i can tell you its going to be kickass because it couldnt be anything else right
10725 i think during the conference when todd talks about it hes just going to have the doom logo up
10726 its been a big issue online but for the most part the response weve gotten has been very positive weve got petitions a few people on forums who are very loud but its really more of the squeaky wheel syndrome
10727 certainly internally theres no doubt i would tell people who dont like the art style that probably getting the art style was the hardest thing
10728 diablo is a game you play for hopefully hundreds of hours and one of the rewards is a variety of different looking environments
10729 people remember the act i dungeons but they kind of conveniently forget the green fields of act i and all of act ii and its palaces its bright deserts
10730 we had all kinds of problems with identification of units combat wasnt very good and the worlds got homogeneous very quickly as we played through it we didnt like it or think it was very much fun
10731 theres a philosophy that goes across all of our games and that philosophy stays true from game to game so it probably draws some comparisons
10732 one philosophy is that our artists feel like if theyre just using photorealism not creating a unique look for the game not stylizing so that its uniquely blizzard then theyre not doing their jobs
10733 if you do follow those rules theres going to be some similarities
10734 we dont say oh we dont want to do anything those games did its all blizzard were all a family wow pulled stuff from diablo ii if we think its a smart choice we try to pull stuff from them we dont really worry about whether its different what matters is does it make the gameplay better that always wins
10735 diablo can do a lot of things wow cant even do
10736 we cant do the level of violence that they can do in diablo iii we would lose our rating if we do the things that diablo iii does they have a much darker vibe
10737 if were actually making the game worse with no other reason than to be different from wow then its a bad choice we dont think when people play that theyll have any problem telling that its a different game
10738 we want to generate the feeling of everything getting worse its part of our narrative it makes the more gloomy part of the game a place where the stakes get higher
10739 youre i have no idea what a cast iron plant is but i will guess its a ti plant

10765 no matter how strongly a large number of shareholders feel about the boards previous actions
10766 it is not going to be a retirees board the benefit of having icahn on the board is the status quo is broken it is going to be under an awful lot pressure to act
10767 some of the bigger shareholders want to push for a new ceo
10768 there is a small possibility that shareholder disappointment results in jerry yang being moved aside in a sort of bloodless coup

10778 i dont think i ever had had a host as good as wirednode before
10779 then i received phone support from his personal mobile number to my house in france kept me updated with changes and upgrades then because i needed another server setup he went the extra mile literally and went down to london to set me up with a new server
10780 from the very beginning was very helpful and friendly helped me completely set up everything and had me up and running in about 10 minutes not only is the service top notch but i think the customer support alone is worth the price these guys over deliver
10781 one of the hardest parts of that process though was that the person i cared for so deeply and never wanted to hurt was not just hurt but became convinced that our 10 years together had been an elaborate scheme in which i had defrauded and manipulated her from day one
10782 i have something to tell you im actually attracted to women
10783 on tue jul 29 2008 at 6 00 pm ken tilton
10784 some of the houseguests are definitely fed up with him
10785 after in depth discussions edf considers that the conditions for a major development in great britain are not met to date
10786 the way he killed her and chopped up the body shows a terrible cruelty he killed her chopped her up and threw part of her body into the river
10787 he started to beat her and she went to live with a friend
10788 he is unemployed but he lives well hes always going to parties in the city
10789 we can confirm the death of a british national in goiania brazil the body was discovered early on july 29
10790 next of kin have been informed and we are providing consular assistance to the family brazilian police are investigating
10791 i think our team is in a little better condition right now relative to the summer conditioning program
10792 weve had a very good off season the players have worked very hard in the summer we feel a little bit better about where we at right now starting out at least from a conditioning standpoint
10793 the focus on camp however should be about getting the details right
10794 pay attention to details focus on what you need to do to be a complete player at your position to create the right kind of habits the design of camp is to create winnable games with the habits we create by the kind of practice fundamentals that we try to incorporate in our practice design
10795 so to be able to sustain that performance for 60 minutes in a game is a part of conditioning its a part of mental toughness we want to create the kind of habits that are going to allow our players to perform at high levels of consistency to be able to sustain that and play winning football
10796 well we really want to try and develop good habits with our players so that we dont have attrition on our squad
10797 i think that if you look across the board you will see a certain amount of attrition in most programs we want to try and continue to develop the players and the program now and compliment them with the best talent that we can recruit
10798 we are going to start most of the young players except jerrell harris who has always played outside linebacker at inside backer
10799 hopefully we will be able to leave one or two of those guys at inside backer but because all of these guys have played some kind of defensive end or outside backer in their high school career maybe move them back where they might be a little more natural early in their career i think from our team standpoint we need to determine who can be an inside backer of our freshman to add depth and competition to what we have
10800 he will start practicing he will face some suspension he will not play in the first three games
10801 it is in effect a grayshirt situation for an injury situation
10802 many said they would have rated it higher but wanted more time to play with it themselves
10803 the proxy fight is over and it will not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose
10804 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
10805 i look forward to working harmoniously with the new board of yahoo

10807 things that are traditional growth drivers for the analog chip industry cell phones pcs certain types of consumer products seem to be doing fine
10808 were going to see a lot of growth in our existing markets
10809 and were promoting a lot of products into new markets
10810 is in its infancy growth there will be far higher than the overall chip market
10811 this is changing hour by hour as we get more cases reported
10812 we have closed three pools previously two day cares and one semi public pool at a homeowners association
10813 weve already had cases of people transmitting it from taking care of other people who are sick
10814 so even closing down all the pools would not completely eradicate it
10815 if youre ill if you have diarrhea you should not be swimming in public pools
10816 if youre taking care of someone with diarrhea you need to remember the old fashioned rule about washing your hands and taking care of your basic sanitation these are the things that stop crypto
10817 ministers go to regions and they make announcements and they ask their staff members whether theres anything important coming forward
10818 some poor staff member sent her email to the wrong destination
10819 i dont think anyones surprised that the ministers will be working through the olympic games nor do i think anyone will be surprised that they make announcements when they go to the regions so you know its a lost email and i really dont think its newsworthy
10820 this is an arrogant and incompetent government a government that believes a few visits will overcome the states problems a government that cant even keep a secret spin strategy private
10821 rather than the odd spin mission morris iemma should get on and fix the problems in nsw and the politics will take care of itself
10822 the lwu inquiry is an issue local councils feel strongly about and im looking forward to participating in minister rees discussion
10823 while local government supports sustainable local water utilities they must remain under local control councils are the closest sphere of government to the community and understand local needs and circumstances
10824 having this years conference at ballina is an opportunity to showcase how coastal councils deal with their water management and conservation issues
10825 local government is a leader in water management councils are committed to water conservation and are working hard to make their own activities and operations efficient
10826 hes a return man that has some track record and he has a background in other areas be it as a gunner or covering kicks
10827 hes shown hes capable of doing that and hes had a nice career doing that
10828 i honestly think im peaking right now as far as my career goes and i feel better than i do when i had my pro bowl year
10829 this is a good situation for me to be a part of
10830 i just went in and had them checked out and they told me you know you have a little astigmatism
10831 im happy because i never knew now i can be 20 20 and be back in action
10832 im just here to help any way i can i felt like a rookie actually they gave me the playbook today and the next thing you know i was out there with the first team
10833 john would have been a good fit for us but it wasnt a good fit for him right now
10834 he must have been bending his legs he moved around pretty well were fortunate to have him in here
10835 youve got to find the right guy in the right circumstances to bring him in
10836 we feel that its very sad that hes not had anyone from the family come forward because this could help him in his recovery
10837 he could have left our facility in a matter of days of coming here because we had done what could be done
10838 whenever weve had people come to us after automobile accidents the most common thing is someone shows up looking for them
10839 when the mexican consulate finally got ahold of someone who they thought was related they said this is not our relative none of them have been in an accident leave us alone
10840 he is unable to write we dont know if that is part of the injury or if he was never able to write
10841 he is ours we receive anybody and everybody who comes here
10842 this announcement is a huge success for americas nursing homes and the millions of people they serve
10843 this decision illustrates cms commitment to target public dollars towards needed patient care
10844 as the recovery process continues some people will find that they are not able to meet all their needs
10845 we are still receiving calls from people who have not yet registered with fema
10846 at that time i believed mr stowell had something to offer
10847 one life had already been destroyed the other life i thought i could salvage i tried something to get him back on track and mr stowell decided that was a track he didnt want to follow
10848 i would like to see him do a minimum of five years in prison i would like to say 10
10849 i thought probation would be a huge wake up call for him
10850 but in a very short time he was doing the same behaviors again drinking and driving i thought that killing somebody would sober him up but it didnt

10852 state property sales became entangled in the ecopolitics of the california environmental quality act
10853 there are things you can do individually though to save energy
10854 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
10855 the projections in the ocs access case indicate that access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030 leasing would begin no sooner than 2012 and production would not be expected to start before 2017 total domestic production of crude oil from 2012 through 2030 in the ocs access case is projected to be 1 6 percent higher than in the reference case and 3 percent higher in 2030 alone at 5 6 million barrels per day for the lower 48 ocs annual crude oil production in 2030 is projected to be 7 percent higher 2 4 million barrels per day in the ocs access case compared with 2 2 million barrels per day in the reference case figure 20 because oil prices are determined on the international market however any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant

10860 consumer electronics is an ideal product category to research online since product features and prices can be easily compared
10861 retailers that are able to facilitate consumers multichannel shopping behaviors will enjoy growth in market share across the enterprise
10862 i do not believe there is anyone who doesnt know that i am in detention
10863 the language on the icc sends the wrong signal to a man who presided over genocide
10864 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
10865 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
10866 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
10867 when a kid says something the school district takes their word and the teacher is just thrown under the rug so to speak
10868 im going to meet with the other four families to see how to proceed further with their cases so that theyre satisfied
10869 she is hot funny and lets not forget her success with the spice girls
10870 she has not been approached but the beckham boys are big fans of high school musical
10871 its sad this is our last time doing a movie together and we love each other so much we really grew up together we can be free when were around one another and the amount of fun we have is ridiculous
10872 de repente o un grito cuando me volv vi al atacante de pie con un cuchillo de supervivencia apu alando al otro pasajero 50 60 veces corr hacia el conductor y le dije que parase el autob s que alguien estaba acuchillando a un pasajero

10874 you should try out for this you should try out for this
10875 because of the supreme court decision there was no hope for this case
10876 this is a tragic case and it is essential that the authorities intervene to secure the release of these two children and their safe return to their family
10877 the fact that it melted at 0 degrees centigrade leaves very little doubt
10878 it is quite amazing and an important step that should allow the development of experimental and therapeutic interventions for this disease
10879 this opens the door to being able to make patient specific stem cell lines from diseases which affect people very late in life like parkinsons disease or alzheimers disease
10880 the only goal of the referendum is to divide mexicans
10881 in the second quarter solid revenue growth across our product categories led to our strong financial performance
10882 we have revised upward our 2008 financial guidance to reflect strong second quarter results as well as positive trends in our critical care and anesthetic analgesic products
10883 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
10884 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
10885 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
10886 well aside from the loud noise and the smell of gunpowder howd you like our american cousin mrs lincoln

10890 im going to sue you im going to take all your names
10891 i love sydney but i feel like im bleeding here
10892 we call ourselves the submerging artists of nsw all this confusion is destroying us
10893 i love sydney but i feel like im bleeding here
10894 i was gutted id been pouring my energy into this production and suddenly it seemed it couldnt go ahead
10895 miraculously we did get the show up but not without very significant and unnecessary stress placed on us by the last minute cut
10896 the state with the largest population of artists and the largest audiences in the country is being culturally penalised
10897 we know problems are created by uncertainty about funding and thats at the top of our agenda to minimise the period of time people are unsure
10898 there have been a lot of interesting things happening interstate and we should be looking for lessons from those but our first step is to make sure we are running as efficiently as we can
10899 were trying to make sure that innovation and new ideas can come forward without people feeling constrained by restrictive categories
10900 ive been advised a number of times by people on staff at arts nsw not to bother applying because there just isnt the funding
10901 money is so thin on the ground that were like hungry seagulls we scurry for crumbs and we cant celebrate other peoples success
10902 the major companies have splashy sexy initiatives for the government to support but the independent sector might as well be invisible we cant sustain ourselves in sydney even though thousands of people come to see our work
10903 i love sydney but i feel like im bleeding here
10904 time to get a move on time to get back on the road

10912 dari tahun ke tahun memang peredaran uang palsu terus mengalami peningkatan
10913 indikasi meningkatnya peredaran uang palsu pada tahun ini juga sudah terlihat
10914 uang palsu meningkat pada pemilihan umum karena pada masa masa itu memang biasanya diperlukan uang tunai

10918 modern games are about coddling the player so they have fun
10919 honestly what we do now doesnt feel that much different from what we were doing then
10920 i could incur variances in some benchmark tests ranging from 10 to 60 percent through combined manipulation of the servers bios settings bios version compiler flags and os release
10921 bios and os engineers have reshaped its finely tuned logic in cipher sometimes with the real intent of making it faster sometimes to homogenize the server to flatten its performance relative to intels
10922 firstly for specific questions about network performance id have to point you towards optus virgin is owned by optus and uses optus network and ask them
10923 for our wireless broadband customers peak hours are in the evenings and if a cells congested its congested mostly at that time but thats not necessarily when you use your iphone i think this will be a very different experience
10924 what were doing at these pricepoints is converging wireless broadband pricing over the phone we sell our wireless broadband laptop modem with 5gb for 39 so we figured on the iphone why not give a gig to start off with on the 70 plan and if you need more you can have another 4gb for 30
10925 you can buy the iphone on any of our cap plans virgin does have higher caps and we have the best mobile data pricing in the industry you can always get 1gb for 15 on top of the voice cap fee
10926 the only thing i would warn customers about is that if they look on our website it may says out of stock in 16gb but thats not true we are initially selling the white 16gb model and then the black 16gb will become available in coming weeks
10927 ozzie has the opportunity to field his best team offensively and defensively on a day to day basis over the next two months
10928 and this gives us a chance to keep some of our middle of the order hitters fresh and producing down the stretch
10929 i spoke with ken and he is excited to be coming to chicago to try to help us reach the postseason
10930 i think he was just a little bit surprised maybe but i think he thought about it and said he wanted to talk to his family about it
10931 i think he agreed its a very good opportunity for him and the club obviously wanted him and pursued him and came after him thats got to be a good feeling for him i guess
10932 maybe hes not the player at 38 that he was at 28 but as you saw last night hes still a force on a ballclub and i think hell definitely help the white sox a lot
10933 jamars decision to violate the terms of our personal agreement for his potential return to our basketball program has left me with no other recourse but to rescind that opportunity
10934 at this time jamar and his family need to focus their attention on the issues that have brought jamar to this point
10935 for the good of our program and players we need to move forward and prepare for the 2008 09 season while jamar will always be a part of the illinois basketball family i have made the decision that he can no longer be a part of our team our entire team and coaching staff are obviously very disappointed he will not be with us we will continue to do everything we can to help him continue his academic career and achieve his goal of graduation
10936 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
10937 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
10938 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
10939 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
10940 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
10941 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic
10942 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
10943 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
10944 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal
10945 violent extremist movements such as al qaeda and its associates
10946 the united states must strengthen and expand alliances and partnerships
10947 the u s alliance system has been a cornerstone of peace and security for more than a generation and remains the key to our success
10948 freedom of action in the global commons and strategic access to important regions of the world to meet our national security needs
10949 the well being of the global economy is contingent on ready access to energy resources
10950 notwithstanding national efforts to reduce dependence on oil current trends indicate an increasing reliance on petroleum products from areas of instability in the coming years not reduced reliance
10951 we as a nation must strengthen not only our military capabilities but also reinvigorate other important elements of national power and develop the capability to integrate tailor and apply these tools as needed
10952 the department of defence has taken on many of these burdens and will need to institutionalise and retain these capabilities but this is no replacement for civilian involvement and expertise
10953 overall the kinds of capabilities we will most likely need in the years ahead will often resemble the kinds of capabilities we need today
10954 what we must guard against is the kind of backsliding that has occurred in the past where if nature takes it course these kinds of capabilities that is counterinsurgency tend to wither on the vine
10955 u s predominance in traditional warfare is not unchallenged but is sustainable for the medium term given current trends
10956 the reality that conventional and strategic force modernisation programmes are strongly supported in the services and in the congress
10957 for the foreseeable future the strategic environment will be defined by a global struggle against a violent extremist ideology that seeks to overturn the international state system
10958 iran and afghanistan remain the central fronts in the struggle
10959 the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
10960 for these reasons arguably the most important component of the struggle against violent extremists is not the fighting we do ourselves but how well we help prepare our partners to defend and govern themselves
10961 china is one ascendant state with the potential for competing with the united states
10962 for the foreseeable future we will need to hedge against chinas growing military modernisation and the impact of its strategic choices upon international security
10963 retreat from democracy and its increasing economic and political intimidation of its neighbours give cause for concern
10964 we shall seek to anchor china and russia as stakeholders in the international system
10965 similarly we look to india to assume greater responsibility as a stakeholder commensurate with its growing economic military and soft power

10989 tims been a fairly wild boy in the past but i think it has to change you its good to have something to put in front of your career
10990 joel and nashs family came to the set a lot i felt that they really embraced me from the beginning
10991 they were like brothers to me they were great they have a really dry sense of humour and a habit of finishing each others sentences
10992 i am fortunate enough to have a lot of friends there a lot are in the acting industry
10993 if i am not working straight away i will work in a jazz bar not as a singer though i dont sing i will be pulling beers
10994 i just think we could do something really interesting that mixes rock and soul together the blues and emotion and it could be really touching
10995 i consider this event equal to if not more important than anything i have done over all these years
10996 the vatican wont prosecute a pedophile priest but if i decide that im not ready for childhood then its condemnation for me
10997 multiple new guitar hero skus and an all new call of duty due to our leapfrog studio strategy
10998 we hate people telling us to wear this and that
10999 sometimes at a photo shoot they try to style this hair
11000 i see dead people they are everywhere they dont know they are dead
11001 a bunch of hyper connected individuals who have found that life 2 0 has left their brains crammed with more information than they can process leaving them anxious jaded or worn out or all of the above
11002 where does the problem lie consuming large amounts of media is actually pretty easy you can see a video from 2007 by 4 hour work week guru
11003 ive got my phone and keys in my purse now what else do i need
11004 we thought it would be mutually beneficial as the worlds attention focused on china so there are a series of co branding spots with nbc

11006 they need to provide a defining moment somewhere along the way
11007 thats what boxing doesnt have so many of anymore and thats what this fight will need
11008 you remember my fight with tommy because of a moment you think of tommys fight with marvin hagler and you remember a moment and you think of ali and frazier and ali and foreman and all of the other legendary fights because they had moments this fight has to have one too and i think it will
11009 the build up seems to be the same so there wont be any problem creating excitement about the fight
11010 but youre comparing it to one of the greatest fights of all time whether you saw it on tv or were there in person so theyre both going to have to bring their a games in order to match it
11011 and dont forget even though im a little biased the division now is nowhere near as loaded you had leonard then you had duran you had four five six guys who were all very good if you beat ray you had to fight duran and then you had to fight pipino and then you had to come see me and i wasnt the easiest guy in the world
11012 i saw tommy a couple months ago and he said we needed to go for a third round together
11013 but its a total no way for me i appreciate that he thinks of me and wants to continue our rivalry but im a grandfather now that pretty much puts it into perspective for me ill be satisfied with the flashbacks
11014 this is one of those fights that has people very intrigued for a good reason
11015 theres the power of both guys and the body shots of both guys and when theyre trying to get to the next level anything can happen this reminds me of the fights from back in the day where at any given moment either guy can win
11016 we are going to make a big big difference in the american marketplace

11025 trabajamos muy bien en la prueba que hicimos en la plata probamos varios elementos con una puesta a punto que fue un mix de ideas entre canapino y yo y que r pidamente trajo sus frutos ya que marcamos un muy buen tiempo y lo repetimos varias veces por lo que encaramos esta carrera de r o cuarto con buenas expectativas
11026 llegamos a r o cuarto con muchas ilusiones ya que hemos podido recuperar el auto en estas ltimas dos fechas es importante comenzar bien los entrenamientos y luego realizar una buena clasificaci n para sentirnos protagonistas desde un principio creo que podemos ser protragonistas y la idea es llevarnos buenos puntos para seguir con ilusiones de pelear el campeonato agradezco al equipo por el trabajo que siempre realiza y a los sponsor que nos acompa an en este proyecto

11051 once upon a time all the writers in the forest got very mad with the forest kings and declared a work stoppage
11052 frustrated with the lack of movement on that front i finally decided to do something very ambitious very exciting very mid life crisisy
11053 the idea was to make it on the fly on the cheap but to make it to turn out a really thrilling professionalish piece of entertainment specifically for the internet to show how much could be done with very little to show the world there is another way to give the public and in particular you guys something for all your support and patience and to make a lot of silly jokes actually that sentence probably should have come first

11066 one reason for sen mccains narrowing the gap is partly energy policy especially high gasoline prices
11067 mccain says he favors off shore drilling to increase gas supply a position backed by 60 percent of pennsylvania voters but opposed by obama and pennsylvania voters now say 56 to 35 percent that the energy policy is more important in the campaign than the iraq war
11068 its a glaring deficiency the comelec resolution is timid literal and non responsive in this sense it is not only old fashioned but calcified

11090 when you look at what intel does with processors most deals and investments are with an eye to grow the market

11094 he succumbed to temptation very late in life almost as if something came upon him that can not be explained
11095 she said she was absolutely shocked and devastated when he was arrested and charged with aggravated indecent assault
11096 he is fortunate he continues to have the support of his wife but he has lost respect within a small community which will have equally devastating effects on his wife
11097 the good thing about the comments we have received whether they be positive or negative is that it has invoked emotion
11098 the idea behind the smiley face is that is shaped as a d for dubbo but it also shows the ideals of the city we are strong happy and in some ways a bit cheeky
11099 one of our promotional pieces revolves around being able to spend time with your family and having time to smile
11100 where i was in sydney i had an hour trip to and from work which basically took more than two hours out of your day
11101 what we will be pushing is that in dubbo people have the time to go home to the kids go to their after work sporting events or their hobbies and because of that live a happy lifestyle doing the things they want to do
11102 she is the cheeriest and most knowledgeable person i know the whole staff hold her in the deepest regard
11103 this has been an outstanding contribution on harvey normans behalf they needed no convincing and were very encouraging
11104 a lot of the lighting at the various facilities is old and inefficient
11105 we want to try and move forward to ensure we are able to provide sporting clubs and sportspeople of the city with sufficient training and game standard lighting
11106 for example currently at the nita mcgrath netball courts we have 13 sealed courts but only three of those are lighted at a training standard we hope to have all of them at that level
11107 some of the work will revolve around using the current infrastructure and poles but the wooden poles at no 3 oval will need a bit of work
11108 we approached the choir about coming to the western region and secured st brigids catholic church as a venue mr semmler said
11109 saturdays concert will raise money for the ongoing community service work of catholic welfare organisation centacare
11110 tickets have been selling well and people from around the region are expected to travel to dubbo for what promises to be a very special event
11111 the attacks were frightening and out of control ms farrell said
11112 the school and education department werent adequately addressing the situation so we decided to go public
11113 it was a big step because many people believe its best not to draw attention to the bullying in case it gets worse
11114 bullying is a big issue that affects people of all ages from every walk of life
11115 we were able to put a plan of action in place for my daughter and she is now happy and doing well at school
11116 my heart goes out to other families who are still caught up in bullying its a silent epidemic spreading like a toxic cloud of smog
11117 people especially children can only take so much hate and abuse is it any wonder that some resort to suicide
11118 bullying is an ongoing issue for a lot of school students she said
11119 dubbo is a true regional airport and serves people from all around the western area
11120 therefore it is in dubbo and the regions best interests to continue talking with virgin and discuss our options as far as the airport goes
11121 i know for a fact that wagga flies interstate to melbourne they are lucky that their runway was extended by the local military base
11122 but a city like dubbo which services quite a large population should be able to offer more than just a service to sydney which as good as it is probably isnt enough
11123 once we start taking jet traffic then security needs to be upgraded
11124 we would need to install scanners x ray machines as well as facilities to scan all luggage before it goes on board
11125 as well as that we would need to have a set up like they do at sydney where there is random explosives testing done on passangers
11126 to get all of the equipment and to staff it would be a very costly exercise
11127 i dont think its the spot i just think its theres only just so much business in dubbo for that store to compete with harvey norman was just too bloody hard theres not enough business to go around
11128 if we cant make joyce mayne work its not going to be easy to make wow work
11129 the environment is very competitive but if youve got an extremely good operator and its a large chain thats well run with lots of financial backing of course they can do well
11130 but not if you havent got all the ingredients in this environment its very hard to open anywhere
11131 the last 12 months have been positive for the shop understanding that seasonal sales for cooling and heating have been quite difficult because dubbo didnt have real hot weather or cold weather
11132 we have to order a long way in advance and take calculated risks we order electric blankets in november for march and we might need to discount them to sell them all
11133 but the effect of the high australian dollar has had a positive impact on the cost of big ticket items
11134 theres a new player in the market people are checking it out and theyre in a honeymoon period but were a local business and i hope it comes back in our favour
11135 but in a way its surprising the lack of impact the new competitor has made on us

11143 one reason im running for democrat is because hes running as a republican
11144 two brothers sons of immigrants are running against each other
11145 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
11146 you would think wed be having a serious debate but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears
11147 i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with
11148 these negative ads spending all this time talking about me instead of talking about what hes going to do is not going to lower gas prices
11149 i dont want to see a drastic change in the ethanol program because too many people rely on it and we want to give certainty to farmers and the rural economy
11150 i do think the effect it is having on feed prices and food prices that moving away from food based ethanol and looking at ways farmers can make money on cellulose ethanol which over the long haul could be much more efficient is probably the direction we want to take
11151 unfortunately its gotten caught up in the slow moving machinery of washington
11152 the president has the power of the bully pulpit had he been talking about flood relief nonstop for the past couple of weeks i suspect a lot of pressure would have been built to get it done
11153 because of the supreme court decision there was no hope for this case

11159 the poorest countries and most vulnerable citizens will suffer the most damaging setbacks even though they have contributed least to the problem
11160 climate change is one of the most pressing global issues of our time
11161 we believe that if the international community is going to seriously address the challenges of climate change then we need to get our priorities right in zimbabwe the effects of climate change have become more evident in the past decade as we have witnessed increased and recurrent droughts as well as occasional floods leading to enormous humanitarian challenges
11162 oil companies are increasingly dependent on these unconventionals as they get squeezed out of countries such as nigeria and russia we fear tar sands are just the entrance ramp to oil shale gas to liquids and other non conventionals which will just press the red button for climate change disaster
11163 im afraid to drive and i dont know why im jealous of the people who are not afraid to drive
11164 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
11165 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
11166 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
11167 move power from remote resource rich areas to places where power is consumed
11168 highlight the quality of our integrated business model and disciplined investment approach
11169 this is the second straight quarter production came in below expectations investors are going to be questioning when they can turn that around
11170 you really hope to see them not turn so much of a profit
11171 im all for making a profit its the american way but its another thing to gouge
11172 given todays strong market incentive for expanding exploration and production we can only believe that reinvesting your vast profits into the production of more oil and natural gas in the united states is a profitable strategy that will help our country decrease its dependence on foreign oil
11173 the oil and natural gas industry is massive because it has to be to effectively compete for global energy resources
11174 the industrys earnings make possible the huge investments necessary to help ensure americas future energy needs are met
11175 we know climate change is a huge problem but theres a missing ingredient of urgency
11176 she was out of her mind almost just mentally emotionally and physically drained
11177 as the average climate warms up the heat extremes will become more extreme and well have more intense more frequent and longer lasting heat waves as we progress through the 21st century
11178 its sort of been the quiet killer for many years
11179 there were a number of days where the body count kept increasing and there was absolutely nothing you could do because the heat had already taken its toll it was a helpless feeling
11180 the very character of the invention requires direct gearing and a non rotatable piston rod
11181 i think when you get down to the very basics of representative democracy this is absolutely vital
11182 i actually think the key issue here is the ethics of what hes done and in terms of ethics he clearly does have a responsibility to answer some questions
11183 for too long many governments businesses and individuals have been wary of committing to action on climate change because they perceive that china the worlds largest emitter is doing little to address the issue
11184 however the reality is that chinas government is beginning to unleash a low carbon dragon which will power its future growth development and energy security objectives
11185 the jury is still out on whether china and the other countries can reach these challenging targets but the evidence in the report shows that china has already stared on a trajectory to becoming an important global hub for low carbon investment innovation and growth in the coming decades
11186 no u s corporation ever made that much in a quarter
11187 but while big oil is making record profits you are paying record prices at the pump and our economy is leaving working people behind
11188 4 billion each year to the oil companies including 1 2 billion for exxon mobil alone
11189 pad oil company profits and save you at best half a tank of gas
11190 all those negative ads hes running wont do a thing to lower your gas prices or lift up the debate in this country
11191 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
11192 i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can do is that what this election is really all about is that worthy of the
11193 has failed the american people on energy and that failure has led directly to our current crisis
11194 thats how america is going to free itself from our dependence on foreign oil not through short term gimmicks but through a real long term commitment to transform our energy sector
11195 im not interested in getting into a tit for tat thats not going to lower your gas prices
11196 i dont know who it will be but i understand that it may not be a traditional publisher it could be a more unique arrangement
11197 it is this market based self governing nature of the internet that is the key to its success
11198 your heavy handed attempts to inject the fcc into the middle of that process threaten to hijack the evolution of the internet to everyones detriment
11199 we believe our actions taken in good faith in response to consumers concerns further confirm the wisdom of the commissions long standing policy showing regulatory restraint
11200 we think that the timing of a new product introduction will depend upon the sales profile for the ds and believe that lower than expected ds hardware sales could trigger an earlier launch for the new device
11201 ds sales are solid worldwide but are weak in japan leading us to expect an introduction of a new device in japan before the end of the calendar year
11202 we think that nintendo has a new handheld device ready for launch in japan before the end of the calendar year

11212 youre on the hot seat because of unsatisfactory performance of discovery
11213 the rule is clear and also now most referees themselves or through their umpires warn the goalkeeper before the game that the rule will be implemented
11214 it may be argued that because of the accuracy of free takers that the penalty 65m free for the offence is too severe and that a more equitable penalty would be a throw in on the 20m line if that is the general opinion then let us change the penalty like some other rules we criticise the referee for implementing them but in the year of playing rule changes we do nothing to propose such changes
11215 we cant have referees and umpires under pressure like this clare people at the game were very annoyed and for me it certainly took all the enjoyment away i go to games to enjoy them and not see scenes like that at the end
11216 i cannot condone that kind of behaviour its unacceptable and should never have happened
11217 im disappointed that there has been so much emphasise put on what happened at the end of the game rather than the game itself
11218 it was a magnificent match played in the proper spirit by two excellent teams
11219 i congratulate tipperary on their victory and wish them well in the remainder of the championship i went to their dressing room after the game and was received with the utmost courtesy
11220 all the talk of their being animosity between the two counties is total rubbish relationships between clare and tipperary have never been better and long may it continue that way
11221 we were expecting a crowd of around 10 000 and if you didnt have a sizeable garda presence for crowd control both inside and outside the ground you are asking for trouble
11222 what happened at the final whistle was out of the hands of the clare and tipperary team management and players

11243 with no exercise you can take a drug and chemically mimic it
11244 honestly i just dont know how that happens whether it would happen in a person i dont know i think its a small miracle it happened at all

11253 we can only assume your ill timed and poorly conceived pursuit of republic is designed to disrupt what you perceive as a competitive threat to your position in the market
11254 an acquisition of republic will most certainly burden the company with excessive debt distract your management result in significant regulatory burdens and thereby reduce shareholder value
11255 we encourage you to act with the best interests of your shareholders in mind in a responsible and prudent manner and to abandon this acquisition
11256 being able to put all my love of chinese culture into a fantasy like the mummy and the wildness of it that was a challenge i couldnt turn down
11257 weve taken the premise of relocating the oconnells from egypt and putting them in china which is as we all know another archaeologically rich nation a long time ago rob was a harvard major in archeology with a special interest in chinese studies so this was a passion piece for him

11277 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews

11286 bill has brought together wonderful people and each talk feels like the highlight of a conference
11287 many of the participants had never before met one another
11288 now they are waiting in line to show one another their research slides and plan to collaborate on research
11289 this kind of meeting is the most productive we can look at each others experiments and learn high end technologies
11290 i asked them to bring their most difficult rock specimens with them
11291 i want them to learn the tricks that we know of how to use these instruments
11292 in china a scientist saw a three dimensional picture of a spherical fossil inside a rock and told me its like seeing the backside of the moon
11293 it is astounding the first time you ever see it instead of waiting 20 or 30 years for the knowledge to diffuse i want to cut through that
11294 today i am exercising my executive authority to avoid a full blown crisis and keep our state moving forward
11295 this is not an action i take lightly but we do not have a budget and as governor i have a responsibility to make sure our state has enough money to pay its bills

11302 six years ago all we had was a vision when we were awarded a franchise
11303 we didnt have a pair of shoulder pads we didnt have an office we didnt have a football team id be lying if i said five years ago i envisioned thousands of people on market street and helicopters flying overhead
11304 it seems absurd that the city would take the position that they dont need to do another study
11305 there would be no surface drilling or blasting in relation to work at the reservoir
11306 the dep has not made a determination on that yet
11307 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
11308 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
11309 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
11310 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
11311 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
11312 the definition of being on your best behavior is going to see your probation officer
11313 we live and work in a civic area we make tradeoffs and this area is safe because of the law enforcement presence
11314 we were never informed by the landlord or the court who the tenant was going to be

11318 ive lost 30 pounds i really like the new me
11319 my weight loss started off modestly but once i invested in the leanology shakes and capsules the weight started to peel off over the next five months i lost 30 pounds and i have managed to keep it off ever since
11320 i went down to 160 pounds i truly feel terrific
11321 i once thought of myself as lean but now felt heavy
11322 ive lost 27 pounds total im really sold on leanology
11323 i began taking leanology in june 2007 and it only took me three months to achieve my desired weight of 145 pounds a loss of 27 pounds i couldnt believe it i had tried many different weight loss programs in the past but they just would stop working after a point and i couldnt lose any more weight with leanology however i could just keep losing weight im really sold on it
11324 what the mccain campaign doesnt want people to know according to one gop strategist i spoke with over the weekend is that they had an ad script ready to go if obama had visited the wounded troops saying that obama was wait for it using wounded troops as campaign props so no matter which way obama turned mccain had an obama bashing ad ready to launch i guess thats political hardball but another word for it is the one word that most politicians are loathe to use about their opponents a lie
11325 we want to have a serious debate but so far weve been hearing about paris hilton and britney spears i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with is that really what the election is about is that worthy of the american people even the media has pointed out that mccain has fallen back into predictable political attacks and demonstratively false statements spending all this time talking about me instead of talking about what hes going to do thats not going to lower your gas prices thatss not going to help you find a job if its been shipped overseas it doesnt do a single thing to help the american people its the politics of the game but the time for game playing is over thats why im running for president
11326 did obama accuse mccain of running a racist xenophobic campaign
11327 john mccain right now hes spending an awful lot of time talking about me
11328 you notice that i havent seen an ad yet where he talks about what hes gonna do and the reason is because those folks know they dont have any good answers they know theyve had their turn over the last eight years and made a mess of things they know that youre not real happy with them
11329 and so the only way they figure theyre going to win this election is if they make you scared of me
11330 but think about it whats the bigger risk us deciding that were going to come together to bring about real change in america or continuing to do same things with the same folks in the same ways that we know have not worked i mean are we really going to do the same stuff that weve been doing over the last eight years thats a risk we cannot afford the stakes are too high
11331 john mccain and the republicans they dont have any new ideas thats why theyre spending all their time talking about me
11332 but since they dont have any new ideas the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
11333 and you know the latest one theyve got me in an ad with paris hilton
11334 you know never met the woman but but you know what theyre gonna try to argue is that somehow im too risky
11335 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
11336 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
11337 not only did we play the race card we dealt it from the bottom of the deck
11338 but since they dont have any new ideas the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
11339 x x x x is great 26 queries in 5 1 seconds from 26 ports with std dev 18219
11340 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
11341 the candidate who started out talking about high minded civil debate has wholeheartedly adopted mr roves low minded and uncivil playbook
11342 the straight talk express has taken a nasty turn into the gutter
11343 with fewer than 100 days before election day senator mccain and his campaign have increasingly resorted to the low road
11344 given our enormous challenges from energy and healthcare to our economic and foreign policy challenges the american people deserve a serious debate instead all weve been getting from the mccain campaign are misleading attacks and paris hilton and britney spears all of the time the mccain campaign spends attacking barack obama is time they are not focusing on helping american families meet the challenges of the 21st century
11345 your children got no business going to the street for love theres no love out there
11346 all thats out there is lost young men looking for love
11347 you only opened 17 tickets in the last 60 days
11348 i was sitting at home doing nothing and all of a sudden a team wants me
11349 he gives manager cecil cooper one more weapon to call upon late in the game
11350 im a player that loves to play the game it doesnt matter what uniform i put on i always go out there and play nine innings hard
11351 im a winner i come to win and ill always be like that
11352 in theory i think we upgraded offensively pudge is obviously still having a tremendous year one of the top catchers in the game today
11353 we signed molina obviously to be a backup catcher and hes one of the premier backups in the game today
11354 he stepped up and did a tremendous job here to hold the fort down while we were going through our stuff with jorgie
11355 there were things i was not comfortable with its a sellers market if you want to meet the sales price then obviously you can get a deal but i wasnt willing to do that
11356 im ready to rock n roll if we could match up with somebody we just couldnt match value for value in the marketplace
11357 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
11358 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
11359 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
11360 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
11361 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
11362 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
11363 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this bloodcurdling scream
11364 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic the way they acted was extraordinary
11365 they reacted swiftly calmly in exiting the bus and as a result nobody else was injured
11366 we want to make sure that the process is followed as aggressively as possible a full legal process and the perpetrator is definitely dealt with the full force of the law
11367 the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
11368 there will be more inspections we certainly dont want this to happen again and there will be an increased emphasis on inspections if we have to take care of these problems we will be as proactive as we can
11369 because of the supreme court decision there was no hope for this case
11370 i was sitting at home doing nothing and all of a sudden a team wants me
11371 he gives manager cecil cooper one more weapon to call upon late in the game
11372 i met him once and he was very kind to me i never got a chance to tell him what i thought that he was my hero
11373 i spent five years in a hospital after the war this is one of the secret awards i wanted i was hoping this would happen in my lifetime and it did
11374 they dropped down the age to enlist to 18 i signed my mothers name and she was not happy about that
11375 i never turned down anything and never argued with any producer or director
11376 he has a passion for acting to survive a war that gives you enough determination that anything is possible he believes life will go on forever
11377 a warrior that can glide in s shaped course to attack
11378 you do not become good by trying to be good but by finding the goodness that is already within you and allowing that goodness to emerge

11380 took another look and decided that because this group had a parade 25 years ago this would not be a new parade and could be grandfathered in
11381 devoted to educating the public about the struggle to achieve american liberty
11382 this is a historic step forward in the fight for equal rights for women
11383 some will have you believe that the wage gap for women is a myth that we already have laws in place to make pay discrimination on the basis of gender illegal
11384 but just because something is illegal does not mean that it does not continue to happen
11385 isnt needed to protect women from wage discrimination such protection is already found in the law
11386 at the end of the day this bill will invite more lawyers to file more lawsuits because it offers them a bigger payday
11387 the bill before the house treats pay discrimination as systemic
11388 this bill does little more than dole out favors to the democrats trial lawyer allies with no new benefit to protect workers
11389 more difficult and error prone and invite a surge of litigation
11390 because of the supreme court decision there was no hope for this case
11391 we welcome competition from the 87 foot giant because its going to validate our space
11392 i just wasnt seeing the production and when you get in a situation where you dont see the production and youve got a young group of receivers that are emerging i just felt like it was in our best interests to let him go at this point
11393 youve got to do whats right for the team i guess its the right move for the team hopefully it is

11399 having a french petit d jeuner sitting outside at a cafe on a sunny morning in paris
11400 the drc is one of the poorest places on the planet and that companies like danzer group are looking for ways to avoid paying taxes is simply outrageous
11401 the awful irony is that while the international community is pouring billions into the war torn drc to help it re build it stands by as companies like danzer continue to con the country out of substantial wealth through tax evasion capital flight and aggressive tax avoidance
11402 whats more these same countries are plundering the natural resources thus contributing to climate change and depriving local populations of sustainable means of future employment
11403 many people sell books by looking at the bibliographies the look at books as objects i never do that i never look at bibliographies or reference books until after i have finished my tour my promenade i look at the book first i enjoy looking at it
11404 an amateur book lover is a beginner which is why it is good to be an amateur since the amateur is also a lover amateur comes from the latin verb amare which means to love and a true bibliophile is a lover in every sense of the word you have to sleep with the book to live with the book you must handle the book you must not be afraid to have intimate contact with the book it is like life really you look at the lady you smile at the lady and you make sure you are not being rebuked then you have to be humble and then you have to be brave and then you must not be afraid to proceed with the task at hand
11405 it has been 10 years since we launched this effort and the message today is that time is not on our side
11406 we cannot make it rain in san diego and we cannot stop the cuts to our imported water but the carlsbad desalination plant will give us drought proof water that is under our control here in san diego the coastal commission must act without delay so we can construct this facility the entire region is counting on this project

11411 it is safe to believe that eternal kindness gives to us beyond that curtain that hides the future not what we think we want but something infinitely better oh death thou gentle end of human sorrows death is just another life and as we give back to mother earth this body that belongs to her we have that assurance of jesus that in my fathers house are many mansions and i go to prepare a place for you oh dear loved one we hope to meet you where suffering and pains are no more where no farewell tears are shed and where all is sunshine and joy
11412 the second quarter figures may have been well up on the first quarter but this is a clearing in the middle of the forest the fact that this is all unfolding over a year or two rather than two consecutive quarters doesnt make it any less painful
11413 there is no way we are out of a recession that is still to come probably in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next
11414 while the stimulus is making our economy stronger than it would have been otherwise the housing correction credit market turmoil and high energy prices remain a considerable drag on the economy
11415 littlefield parsons amp co manufacturers of union cases patented oct 14 1856
11416 its surprising that energy output has not responded to higher prices
11417 its something we need to wake up to here just because we have it doesnt mean were going to be able to sell it
11418 the main challenges that face barrick and i think i may as well speak for the industry at large are the cost factors
11419 we still believe that the canadian economy will avoid an outright recession but it could be on the edge
11420 unless congress steps up with another and more effective stimulus package which it absolutely should future gdp reports will be even worse
11421 the impact of the foreign sector on the economy in the last three quarters has been extraordinary
11422 but what this does for me is offend my sense of fairness

11427 the detectors are working well and were really pleased with how the instrument is working
11428 for the past 15 years or so the holy grail of nanoelectromechanical systems has been to push them to a small enough size with high enough sensitivity so that they might resolve the mass of a single molecule or even single atom
11429 this has been a challenge even at cryogenic temperatures where reduced thermal noise improves the sensitivity
11430 we have achieved sub single atom resolution at room temperature
11431 interestingly the nature of this chemical modification is long term and hard to reverse and this fits with depression
11432 the whole idea that the genome is so malleable in the brain is surprising these observations open an entirely new avenue of research and potential therapeutic interventions
11433 youre getting the benefits of exercise without having to do any work
11434 the mouse doctors and cell biologists are of course quite enthusiastic about these things but the human doctors are a little more reticent
11435 it was found to be a quite safe drug at least at the doses we were using
11436 this team has been doing a great job weve had a lot of speed been qualifying up front and been racing up front were back
11437 one hundred percent its wide open i think you have to look at the momentum of teams theres a lot of racing left weve turned things around in maybe a 10 or 12 race stretch we can lose it in a 10 to 12 race stretch technology changes so fast in this sport then you couple the chase into that the chase is a totally different world
11438 we came off of last year and felt like we couldnt do anything wrong then this year we went to vegas and i had a car that was not wrecked but was three seconds off the pace i mean its just such a humbling sport technology changes so fast so much moves around that you cant sit still
11439 weve known that weve been hitting on the right things
11440 we could see the momentum we just had a lot of races where strategy came into play and it didnt work out for us we just didnt get the finishes we deserved
11441 this team has been doing a great job weve had a lot of speed been qualifying up front and been racing up front were back
11442 one hundred percent its wide open i think you have to look at the momentum of teams theres a lot of racing left weve turned things around in maybe a 10 or 12 race stretch we can lose it in a 10 to 12 race stretch technology changes so fast in this sport then you couple the chase into that the chase is a totally different world
11443 we came off of last year and felt like we couldnt do anything wrong then this year we went to vegas and i had a car that was not wrecked but was three seconds off the pace i mean its just such a humbling sport technology changes so fast so much moves around that you cant sit still
11444 weve known that weve been hitting on the right things
11445 we could see the momentum we just had a lot of races where strategy came into play and it didnt work out for us we just didnt get the finishes we deserved
11446 the new airport in doha qatar is going to be the first large system realised by selex sistemi integrati a finmeccanica company in the atc domain
11447 most obvious genius award in the history of the genius awards
11448 this follows on from the finance company failures that weve had to date according to the numbers thats over 1 8 billion worth of funds with mortgage trusts income funds and now this thats about another 1 7 billion dollars in funds that are tied up we think that the economic implications are more serious than it is for the listed property sector which obviously doesnt have any redemption risks
11449 potentially one of the biggest weve had in two decades
11450 we think the reserve bank needs to cut interest rates pretty aggressively and i think the longer they wait the more risks theyre taking
11451 but it was considered good business practice and common sense to have all staff located in the one building within the central business district
11452 we arent looking at selling the management contract because we are at the moment seen as a forced seller it is not on the market weve had approaches from six parties but now is not the time to consider it
11453 why should i even bother learning harmonica since i prefer etc
11454 i can confirm that we arrested mohammed dali carvalho santos yesterday near the murder scene i cannot tell you exactly where but it was in a hiding place he had fled to after the murder he has already confessed to murdering cara and decapitating her body
11455 he has yet to show any remorse for what he has done he has not cried or expressed regret of any kind
11456 the murder took place at a flat in goiania near to the university which they used to share until they stopped dating some time before the killing after cara ended the relationship
11457 cara was living with friends at the time she was murdered and mohammed was still at the flat he killed her with a single stab wound to the ribs using a kitchen knife which we have recovered and are currently examining for forensic evidence
11458 we have found drugs but i am not in a position to say how many drugs have been found or what type of drugs they are
11459 we can confirm the death of a british national in goiania in brazil next of kin have been informed and we are providing consular assistance to the family
11460 now you know what i expect of you in class and i expect the very same thing from you on this trip
11461 now you know what i expect of you in class and i expect the very same thing from you on this trip
11462 now you know what i expect of you in class and i expect the very same thing from you on this trip
11463 it is a combination of fewer housing transactions because buying a house is a key time when people change supplier and more people buying mobile broadband instead of fixed line access
11464 protestations from the company that the year will turn out ok may not carry much weight in the current environment and the share price would seem to be reflecting doubts over the sustainability of the dividend
11465 in contrast to english the words for socialist anarchist politics and economics do not have negative connotations
11466 china changed course at some stage i dont know when i cant guarantee there wont be other changes
11467 i dont know who did the deal i am still finding out
11468 i understand it was reached with very senior ioc and chinese officials
11469 it has dented my reputation quite seriously people take me at my word so i expect the information i am giving to be consistent
11470 i am disappointed because i have learned in corporate life that you dont deliver surprises to constituents and the media is a key constituent at the olympics
11471 i believed we would stick to the agreement that is what we have done at different games held in all sorts of societies i thought china would judge it was in their interests if they shifted fine but tell us
11472 in contrast to english the words for socialist anarchist politics and economics do not have negative connotations

11481 were just going to keep turning over flipping over stones and bringing in a lot of people
11482 and it probably wont change for two to three years quincy is here and we will have a workout with quincy
11483 i have been pleased with the quarterbacks and i think the competition is really good
11484 it just means we have to make sure were doing our due diligence on whats available
11485 in contrast to english the words for socialist anarchist politics and economics do not have negative connotations
11486 all the big names in the field have become big names and presumably more wealthy through their reputations build on giving away knowledge
11487 the open passing around of trade secrets will start to close the professionals protecting the professionals
11488 i think well definitely have a good crack at it
11489 theres probably more expectation were not flying under the radar this year
11490 this year i think everyone sees us as a threat so we cant surprise teams
11491 they always bring some good ideas and different things to training and also more leadership
11492 were definitely not looking to do anything silly like that and lose a player for the whole year
11493 all the boys are real friendly its a good professional environment but it has its fun times as well
11494 it is from its catholic identity that the school derives its original characteristics and its
11495 the catholic school on the threshold of the third millennium
11496 it is from its catholic identity that the school derives its original characteristics and its
11497 catholic schools are at once places of evangelization of complete formation of inculturation of apprenticeship in a lively dialogue between young people of different religions and social backgrounds
11498 the ecclesial nature of the catholic school therefore is written in the very heart of its identity as a teaching institution
11499 in which faith culture and life are brought into harmony
11500 i am particularly pleased at what this agreement means for our educational mission and the continued safety of our students
11501 when the mayor and council want to get student opinion they can use this forum similarly when students want to bring an issue to the mayor or council this could be the forum to do that
11502 a 2003 report financed by the department of defense revealed that nearly one third of a nationwide sample of female veterans seeking health care through the va said they experienced rape or attempted rape during their service
11503 well bianca im not going to tell you what the doctor thinks it is
11504 if you dont like that way i am then leave
11505 the key to the success and continued growth of the office has been the strategic hiring of such talented professionals as david lubin david clearly understands client service and has the experience and talent to deliver innovative and sustainable solutions he is a great addition to our team
11506 gensler is where i have wanted to be for a long time here i will be able to leverage my best work and provide a deeper resource base to further service our clients
11507 this is the perfect storm for our business and we see no signs of it blowing over
11508 overall results were weaker than expected due to one time charges and asset sale writeoffs in both rescap and gmac auto
11509 we expect weak results in both businesses to continue at least through the end 2008
11510 ive been involved in the cadet program for four years and were now getting about 20 per cent of people joining the brigade through this
11511 that in itself keeps people motivated and makes them safer fire fighters
11512 in a lot of cases breathing apparatus training is not something thats offered to everybody so priority has to be given to the brigades that carry that equipment
11513 its good in the sense that weve got a younger set of fire fighters who are well trained keen and enthusiastic
11514 their willingness to put themselves out there is a benefit to the organisation and the community
11515 theres no reason rhys couldnt go on to become a commissioner
11516 through this course were trying to give them life skills and a greater level of self confidence too
11517 we never doubted that the house would be completed but we knew there was going to be a bit of a black hole when nothing happened
11518 we knew it was going to start but its hard not knowing when
11519 even now after the news of the sale we feel the same yes were pleased things are moving but until we see the tradies back on the site were not getting our hopes up
11520 once the work starts again we might crack some champagne
11521 in before christmas was our plan and you never know we might still get there
11522 we will assess the remaining homes as and when we receive their claims
11523 we are awaiting full assessment reports but feedback from assessors to date has been very positive on the condition of the houses
11524 we knew it was going to start but its hard not knowing when
11525 even now after the news of the sale we feel the same yes were pleased things are moving but until we see the tradies back on the site were not getting our hopes up

11529 we are awaiting full assessment reports but feedback from assessors to date has been very positive on the condition of the houses
11530 trade has not been good and cuts have to be made somewhere for us it was advertising and entertainment
11531 we have reduced our entertainment from three nights a week to one night
11532 its a catch 22 situation because those in the entertainment industry arent getting as many jobs so they are putting their prices up to cover themselves but we cant keep spending money we dont have
11533 clubs and pubs have dropped right off they are booking a lot less bands or have cancelled their program entirely
11534 we are basically staying alive on private functions now like weddings and things
11535 the ban means that trade has decreased and we the entertainment industry are the first ones to feel it
11536 we are always a good barometer on how the economy is going and it hasnt been healthy since july last year
11537 bands are loosing money they are taking a cut to try and get bookings
11538 they havent pushed their prices up much its just to cover the diabolical fuel prices
11539 i think youll find that the cheaper bands just arent available any more a lot of them have had to quit and are trying to find day jobs
11540 the kids have had training at the base as well as spending nights at creswell and albatross to get used to camping
11541 a lot of them have new equipment which they are learning to set up and prepare for the trek
11542 two sailors kristian mitchell and kylie hide are also coming on the trek acting as mentors for the kids
11543 there has also been generous financial support which will allow us to buy things like gym passes so they can continue to train and prepare
11544 but they will need to work closely with their mentors and work as a team to help each other
11545 each participant has been given the name of an australian serviceman who died on the track so that they can research his personal history and they will able to see that soldiers war grave
11546 this will be a life changing experience for these kids
11547 it seemed like a good idea to be a mentor and to offer life experience
11548 we have each been assigned three kids and i have three of the best
11549 when the chance to gain my breathing apparatus qualification came up i thought it would be a good way for me to see if i liked it
11550 in the test we had 60 seconds to get into the gear when you dont know the gear thats pretty hard
11551 it got the adrenalin pumping it was more fun than it was stressful though
11552 when i signed up i said to my mum that i didnt know how far i would go but would just see what happened
11553 we were talking about going through another reclassification process just to make doubly sure but once we found the ad there were no more concerns
11554 half way through the process they said they were not even sure they can sell us this land
11555 they mentioned the land may be classified as community land we couldnt believe it
11556 that would mean we had been wasting our time for the last 18 months or so because they had no authority to sell without reclassifying the land as operational
11557 we said well stop now cut our losses and council can cover our costs
11558 we then inserted clauses in the contract to address the community classification issue
11559 id have real concerns real concerns if council knowingly tried to sell community land
11560 i would like to move it fairly quickly because theres a third party involved being the purchaser of the land
11561 in the face of impossible odds people who love their country can change it
11562 the guy at the country club with the beautiful date holding a martini and a cigarette that stands against the wall and makes snide comments about everyone who passes by
11563 there are signs that the obama campaigns arrogance has begun to anger reporters
11564 when rove speaks the political class pays attention usually with good reason
11565 obama needs to be careful not to appear too arrogant
11566 closing the circle milbank came to the wapo in 1999 from tnr
11567 eight years ago i was a hard core liberal mccainiac
11568 i still feel some pangs of affinity for the old codger
11569 mccain could redefine the democratic party once again as the champion of wilsonian interventionism
11570 only a handful of politicians per generation capture the publics imagination and channel it toward moral and rational ends
11571 mccains truth telling and his war against soft money made him a hero to the liberal press
11572 im a player that loves to play the game it doesnt matter what uniform i put on i always go out there and play nine innings hard
11573 im a winner i come to win and ill always be like that
11574 in theory i think we upgraded offensively pudge is obviously still having a tremendous year one of the top catchers in the game today
11575 we signed molina obviously to be a backup catcher and hes one of the premier backups in the game today
11576 he stepped up and did a tremendous job here to hold the fort down while we were going through our stuff with jorgie
11577 there were things i was not comfortable with its a sellers market if you want to meet the sales price then obviously you can get a deal but i wasnt willing to do that
11578 im ready to rock n roll if we could match up with somebody we just couldnt match value for value in the marketplace
11579 its surprising that energy output has not responded to higher prices
11580 its something we need to wake up to here just because we have it doesnt mean were going to be able to sell it
11581 the main challenges that face barrick and i think i may as well speak for the industry at large are the cost factors
11582 we still believe that the canadian economy will avoid an outright recession but it could be on the edge
11583 unless congress steps up with another and more effective stimulus package which it absolutely should future gdp reports will be even worse
11584 the impact of the foreign sector on the economy in the last three quarters has been extraordinary

11587 there were attacks that targeted senior officers and we thank god they failed and our colleagues are safe
11588 investigations are still ongoing to see who was behind the attacks and it is too early to point out motives although they appeared to be of al qaeda style
11589 on monday morning jul 21 we were startled by an explosion in the house of colonel issa al issawi who is known as the leader of the campaign against militants in fallujah and surroundings house
11590 to our surprise the explosion took place on the roof where at least four guards were posted
11591 one of them was warning his colleagues that the other was a suicide attacker and asking them to take cover then another policeman fired towards both of them
11592 all of us ran away and then the second bomb went off many policemen were killed and injured in the two blasts these have again ended our dreams of security
11593 col issawi has been a police officer for over 20 years meaning he is one of saddam husseins officers who agreed to continue although the country was occupied by the americans
11594 people of fallujah know that he helped al qaeda worked with the islamic party and now is the right arm of the american occupation
11595 we knew that many of the members of the awakening forces were members of al qaeda
11596 it was said that about 100 young men were executed inside fallujah police station by the awakening militias in january and february 2007 it became clear later that the executioners were fallujah police leaders following orders issued by the u s military from the headquarters next door
11597 it seems that we iraqis will all kill each other as long as this u s occupation is paying our leaders to widen the gap between us
11598 if you like exercise you like the idea of getting more bang for your buck
11599 if you dont like exercise you love the idea of getting the benefits from a pill
11600 almost no one gets the recommended 40 minutes to an hour per day of exercise for these people if there was a way to mimic exercise it would make the quality of exercise they do more efficient
11601 the introduction and increasing use of antipsychotic medication the greater awareness of the treatment of psychosis by primary care providers after deinstitutionalisation and the creation of regional health authorities with responsibility for defined populations may have all contributed to the observed decline in homicide since the 1970s
11602 community based mental health services have improved very considerably over the last 20 30 years
11603 thats shown by the fact there was virtually no care for people with severe and enduring mental health problems outside hospital whereas now there are community mental health teams outreach work and crisis teams to provide support and help
11604 the number of homicides committed by people with mental distress have long been a tiny fraction of the total but due to sensational media coverage of one off cases there has been a widespread misconception that they are more common than they really are
11605 evidence shows that people with mental health problems are in fact far more likely to be the victims of violent crime than the perpetrators
11606 its good news if the number is coming down but i would have strong reservations about the way statistics are collected
11607 over the course of the past year the congregation for the doctrine of the faith has studied the proposals which you presented on behalf of the house of bishops of the traditional anglican communion during your visit to the offices of this dicastery on oct 9 2007
11608 as the summer months approach i wish to assure you the serious attention which the congregation gives to the prospect of corporate unity raised in that letter
11609 to recall anglicanism to its heritage to heal divisions caused by departures from the faith and to build a vibrant church for the future based on powerful local leadership
11610 the situation within the anglican communion in general has become markedly more complex
11611 as soon as the congregation is in position to respond more definitely concerning the proposals you have sent we will inform you
11612 i have responded expressing my gratitude on behalf of my brother bishops reaffirming our determination to achieve the unity for which jesus prayed with such intensity at the last supper no matter what the personal cost this might mean in our discipleship
11613 this letter should encourage our entire communion and those friends who have been assisting us
11614 it should also spur us to renewed prayer for the holy father for cardinal levada and his staff at the congregation for the doctrine of the faith and for all our clergy and people as we move to ever closer communion in christ with the holy see
11615 we believe that our data add to those from previous studies showing a causal relationship between h pylori infection and gastric cancer and also support the use of h pylori eradication to prevent the development of gastric cancer
11616 preventing gastric cancer by eradicating h pylori in high risk regions should be a priority
11617 this result adds to our understanding of the relationship between h pylori and stomach cancer and to the debate on how we should treat people with this infection
11618 a lot of what we do is work on rta roads which is paid for by rta grants
11619 if the rta didnt give us the grants we wouldnt do the work if their roads crumbled it would mean the state government was unsustainable
11620 we will find that many councils will not be able to provide their infrastructure and capital works programs will become a thing of the past for many councils
11621 the central west jobs expo has been on the calender for a number of years now and tries to focus on year 10 students ahead of their subject selection for year 11 and 12
11622 it spreads awareness of whats available locally we dont want to create the impression that its all about trades its about jobs
11623 demand is huge tafe are telling us we need more people there is absolutely huge demand within the sign writing industry
11624 we have practised this unit pricing in south africa for a few years
11625 the problem for us here we wouldve had it sooner but we updated our system and we moved to a new administration so its just taken a bit more time to integrate it here
11626 so its not about being the first its just about good business practice to try to give customers as much information about products that they need
11627 and particularly with inflation you have a lot of manufacturers changing their size packs
11628 so what this says is you have per 100 gram or litre or per 100 mil this is what the price is so it takes it down to the basics
11629 woolworths has said theyre going to introduce it queensland has introduced legislation to introduce it
11630 ive seen some modelling that suggests that this could put about 800 million a year back in the consumers pockets and not in the supermarkets pockets
11631 the big oil companies are wallowing in cash and exxon is the most aggressive in buying back its stock instead of taking the risks it should to both find new oil and develop new forms of energy
11632 consumers and government deserve a truer picture of where their hard earned gasoline and heating oil dollars are disappearing to
11633 its oil production continues to drop even after excluding political disruptions of supply exxon wont take the risks or spend the money to produce new energy even in areas where it already has made deals or obtained rights
11634 in a normal market with prices for a product rising like they have for oil manufacturers would be spending like crazy to make more of it
11635 yet oil companies including exxon would rather sit back and make more money by selling less even if both u s coasts and the alaska wilderness preserve were handed to them theyd just demand more tax breaks and not drill
11636 oil companies are spiting the future for the sake of cash in hand
11637 the companies quarterly reports are a testament to management whose sole focus is short term profits not a long term energy future
11638 im wishing for a mommy who is nice and has long straight hair
11639 the birth defects come from high blood sugars in the mom in the earliest part of the pregnancy when the fetal organs are developing
11640 teenagers people in their 20s people in their 30s there are more type 2 diabetes than ever
11641 the hormones and the weight gain associated with all that makes it a little more difficult even if you were well managed prior to the pregnancy you may notice the blood sugar levels still fluctuating quite a bit
11642 the key component in nocera and kanans new process is a new catalyst that produces oxygen gas from water another catalyst produces valuable hydrogen gas
11643 o que lhes causou intenso sofrimento f sico e ps quica
11644 the one thing i find hard to explain is why they dont contribute more financially
11645 natural que pessoas na mesma situa o sejam atendidas pelo mesmo advogado
11646 ser que quem seq estrou o embaixador norte americano e o prendeu dizendo todo dia que ia mat lo n o cometeu ato de tortura da mesma forma igualmente conden vel
11647 se for para julgar quem torturou vamos julgar todos inclusive muitos que est o na c pula do governo hoje e tem at ministro de estado
11648 existe uma lei de anistia e a nica forma de se punir os militares que praticaram estes atos de tortura que considero reprov veis anular a lei porque o outro lado tamb m cometeu atos hediondos em diversas ocasi es que precisam ser julgados da mesma forma
11649 highlight the quality of our integrated business model and disciplined investment approach
11650 this is the second straight quarter production came in below expectations investors are going to be questioning when they can turn that around
11651 you really hope to see them not turn so much of a profit
11652 im all for making a profit its the american way but its another thing to gouge
11653 given todays strong market incentive for expanding exploration and production we can only believe that reinvesting your vast profits into the production of more oil and natural gas in the united states is a profitable strategy that will help our country decrease its dependence on foreign oil
11654 the oil and natural gas industry is massive because it has to be to effectively compete for global energy resources
11655 the industrys earnings make possible the huge investments necessary to help ensure americas future energy needs are met
11656 bringing the state back into the bedrooms of the nation
11657 i commend my colleagues for passing the veterans compensation cost of living adjustment act of 2008 many veterans and their survivors count on these monthly payments to get by and in these hard times we must not allow rising costs to eat away at their spending power for veterans and their survivors who rely on their compensation including nearly 18 000 served by vas regional office in my home state of hawaii this cola is the least we can do
11658 if i couldnt go to a tap and get a drink of water i dont know what id do
11659 i dont really give it much thought actually i figure north battlefords got to have clean water bottled water just doesnt taste the same
11660 big city water in this country is absolutely fine but the problem with assuring safe potable water is that it takes a minimum degree of microbiological knowledge and engineering skill and a supporting infrastructure
11661 doing that requires you have a large enough customer base so you can afford the high quality relatively expensive services
11662 ontario is a paragon of sanity compared to british columbia where you have a third of the population and 4 000 water suppliers
11663 every small town every little place has its own jealously guarded water systems most of which have inadequate treatment
11664 the real problem with canadian drinking water quality is we have far too many rinky dink suppliers and theyre too small to produce the level of safety that our society seems to demand
11665 they can have effects on reproduction some pharmaceuticals estrogens testosterone some pesticides the endocrine system is the one that produces hormones and it is very very sensitive and there are chemicals in the water that influence the endocrine system of fish
11666 i think the reproductive effects are potentially important and we do hear about human fertility issues sperm count in males decreasing problems with learning difficulties in children allergies asthma cancers there are so many things we dont have an explanation for
11667 those systems will catch quite a few numbers of nasties like oils and very complex large chain molecules like pcbs they dont do well at all with these endocrine disruptors
11668 most pesticides and fertilizers that get into our streams and rivers never pass through a sewage treatment plant it is really really serious
11669 what if we manage the dams in the mountains in a different way what if we held the water in there instead of opening it up at different times in the year and ran it off in june and july when the water is low what would that do to the ecosystem
11670 right now there are large water users such as agriculture so agriculture right now is like the water bank
11671 theres a real problem with drawing on that water bank because water is food if you draw down on that water bank and take food out of the system where are we
11672 s of a camcorder while the camera supports which is handy for 30fps vga movie mode with one pound plus physique behind access drive mode the 872 shots must be removed before using the 5 1 panasonic lumix because it casts a quality of the lens across the bottom of an image
11673 we know climate change is a huge problem but theres a missing ingredient of urgency
11674 oil companies are increasingly dependent on these unconventionals as they get squeezed out of countries such as nigeria and russia we fear tar sands are just the entrance ramp to oil shale gas to liquids and other non conventionals which will just press the red button for climate change disaster
11675 for too long many governments businesses and individuals have been wary of committing to action on climate change because they perceive that china the worlds largest emitter is doing little to address the issue
11676 however the reality is that chinas government is beginning to unleash a low carbon dragon which will power its future growth development and energy security objectives
11677 the jury is still out on whether china and the other countries can reach these challenging targets but the evidence in the report shows that china has already stared on a trajectory to becoming an important global hub for low carbon investment innovation and growth in the coming decades
11678 the poorest countries and most vulnerable citizens will suffer the most damaging setbacks even though they have contributed least to the problem
11679 climate change is one of the most pressing global issues of our time
11680 we believe that if the international community is going to seriously address the challenges of climate change then we need to get our priorities right in zimbabwe the effects of climate change have become more evident in the past decade as we have witnessed increased and recurrent droughts as well as occasional floods leading to enormous humanitarian challenges
11681 she was out of her mind almost just mentally emotionally and physically drained
11682 as the average climate warms up the heat extremes will become more extreme and well have more intense more frequent and longer lasting heat waves as we progress through the 21st century
11683 its sort of been the quiet killer for many years
11684 there were a number of days where the body count kept increasing and there was absolutely nothing you could do because the heat had already taken its toll it was a helpless feeling
11685 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
11686 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
11687 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
11688 move power from remote resource rich areas to places where power is consumed
11689 we are all more than the skin we are in
11690 a news and media blog in the libertarian tenor with limited government overtones facilitating the flow of ideas information e commerce and inspiration within the democratic republics of the world
11691 my reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government
11692 commerce with all nations alliance with none should be our motto
11693 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
11694 the happy union of these states is a wonder their constitution a miracle their example the hope of liberty throughout the world
11695 the constitution is the guide which i never will abandon
11696 a bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government and what no just government should refuse or rest on inference
11697 highlight the quality of our integrated business model and disciplined investment approach
11698 this is the second straight quarter production came in below expectations investors are going to be questioning when they can turn that around
11699 given todays strong market incentive for expanding exploration and production we can only believe that reinvesting your vast profits into the production of more oil and natural gas in the united states is a profitable strategy that will help our country decrease its dependence on foreign oil
11700 the oil and natural gas industry is massive because it has to be to effectively compete for global energy resources
11701 the industrys earnings make possible the huge investments necessary to help ensure americas future energy needs are met
11702 we should not even begin discussing handing over more public land to the oil companies until they first use the land they already hold
11703 those making those assertions dont understand the bidding and leasing process
11704 this is no substitute for a real bill on drilling
11705 the american people are rightly frustrated by the failure of the democratic leaders in congress to enact commonsense solutions
11706 the president has failed in his economic policy and now he wants to say but for drilling in protected areas offshore our economy would be thriving and the price of gas would be lower
11707 that hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to relieve the pain of consumers at the pump and to promote energy independence
11708 have one answer and one answer only drill in places that are not now authorized
11709 this is one of the most unimaginable things to actually happen to a child
11710 this woman may have given birth to the little boy but she is no mother to have done things like this
11711 this child was brave enough to tell the truth and thankfully the jury believed that truth
11712 you knew didnt you there could be no pregnancy since you had a tubal ligation and a hysterectomy years before
11713 she has had a hard life but has a supporting family and can fulfill all the requirements of probation if you recommend it
11714 we can be here for hours and hours to talk about all the bad things she has done but if you recommend probation she can walk out of this courtroom and go down the elevator with you
11715 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients we have a responsibility to take a leadership role on this major health issue
11716 we have a further responsibility to treat the whole patient both mentally and physically allowing patients to use tobacco products while in our care defeats this purpose
11717 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients we have a responsibility to take a leadership role on this major health issue
11718 we have a further responsibility to treat the whole patient both mentally and physically allowing patients to use tobacco products while in our care defeats this purpose
11719 our decision to go tobacco free is not an attempt to force anyone to quit smoking
11720 rather the tobacco free initiative is a concrete way we can demonstrate our ongoing commitment to healthy living
11721 it was in excellent shape to be made in 1888
11722 congress should not adjourn until weve done something to bring down the high cost of gasoline
11723 i dont see how the leadership can adjourn when the folks back home are looking to us to help them with their gas prices and grocery prices they are struggling to meet their familys needs and congress should be helping them
11724 i am also an original cosponsor of the american energy act an all of the above energy strategy developed by members of the house republican conference
11725 republicans are asking for a simple up or down vote on this bill before congress adjourns
11726 none of these votes led to more domestic production but my legislation would take this decision out of the hands of congress and place it back where it belongs with the residents of the state of alaska
11727 this is much too long to leave americans hostage to the gas pumps
11728 exploting our suffering at the gas pump as an excuse to represent big oil
11729 every informed person knows there isnt enough oil in anwar to dramatically impact the price of gas
11730 the study also predicts a 2 to 6 percent decline in market share for all imported liquid petroleum products
11731 this means the price per barrel of oil would fall between only 41 cents and 1

11754 un resolution 242 says that israel is to return all territories obtained in the 48 war and to either compensate the refugees and their relatives or to help them repatriate
11755 israel has explelled these arabs in acts which under inmternational law is considered ethnic cleansing even well respected israeli historians now agree that the expulsion was ethnic cleansing
11756 frankly i dont like obamas left wing big government policy proposals at all but its hard not to throw my support behind him if the alternative promises to give solace to all these right wing crazies and the numerous vermin who made jesse helms out to be some sort of american hero

11761 you know gas prices are high when texans start driving golf carts
11762 the court recognized the dramatic impacts the medi cal cuts will have on medi cal beneficiaries and the states health care system but ruled on narrow procedural grounds that it could not grant relief to the millions of californians whose health care will be impacted adversely by these cuts
11763 p etitioners have presented a substantial showing of actual harm which will likely occur as a consequence of the reimbursement reductions
11764 demonstrate the importance of equal access to health care to call residents of california including those covered by medi cal as well as the many and increasing number of uninsured california residents whose access problems are presumably even greater than those of medi cal participants
11765 this is a terrible blow to medi cal providers across the state
11766 some pharmacists have already begun turning away patients as they are losing 10 20 30 or more on nearly every prescription filled with this lawsuit set back i imagine that more and more pharmacists will have to make tough decisions regarding how they conduct business we have received reports from pharmacists all over the state who have indicated that soon they will have to turn away patients cut hours stop accepting new patients and is some extreme case have to close their doors altogether any way you look at it patients will suffer irreparably
11767 this is the fourth court in five years to find that the state of california has put at risk the access to health care for millions of californians by underfunding the medi cal program
11768 we are hopeful that should the courts be unable for technical procedural reasons to grant some relief to millions of californians who rely on medi cal for their health care needs the governor and legislature will act to do so
11769 the decision by the court to allow the medi cal payment cuts to proceed puts all californians at risk these cuts are likely to result in more patients seeking care in already overcrowded and overburdened emergency rooms which will mean longer wait times and higher costs for everyone patients are the real losers in this decision
11770 this ruling is an unfortunate setback for denti cal patients in california however cda remains committed to working with the legislature to assure adequate funding for the denti cal program
11771 the courts ruling is hurtful as more adult day health care centers close due to the states cut to medi cal reimbursements medi cal participants will end up in nursing homes emergency rooms or worse die
11772 aarp is extremely disappointed with this ruling these cuts will further erode medical services putting the health of millions of californians at risk aarp strongly believes that the state budget should not be balanced on the backs of our states most vulnerable citizens
11773 family physicians see daily how our patients are suffering the effects of the medi cal cuts we will continue working closely with our elected leaders to find a better way forward for now patients unable to find physicians to care for them are delaying much needed care or turning to already overcrowded emergency rooms where care is considerably more expensive
11774 but of course of course they they wouldnt allow us to carry the confederate battle flag
11775 yeah we couldnt carry the confederate battle flag in the parade but they let the buffalo soldiers participate

11790 i always look at it as getting to the heart of what they really want
11791 struggling is a bad word we look at it and ask what our opportunities are we have a strong hardcore base right now but at the same time we want to go from 12 million to 20 30 million users on live
11792 we can go and change the operating system to deliver a new box without changing the hardware its never been able to happen before in the console world
11793 the cell phone i bought a few months ago hasnt changed the ipod i bought a year ago hasnt changed since i bought it in this case were actually enabling the xbox to get better over time weve done that with the spring and fall updates incrementally but this is completely reinventing what you think the xbox is all about
11794 i dont want to hit myself too hard because i was pretty involved in the original version
11795 but when we were first thinking about it there would be maybe 200 items on marketplace so that was our design point but weve got 17 000 and were going upwards at an exponential rate
11796 i wouldnt agree with that i think when you see lips it takes singstar much further
11797 i dont think risk is just the domain of the type of game you do we dont just want to do titles because theyre different we want to find things that we think can have large scale appeal but we have some things in the portfolio people will look at and see are different and risky and new takes on things we know risk taking is not just about game type but what you do with it
11798 were just at a point in the cycle where youre seeing more sequels i can tell you we have other new properties that are unannounced that we feel very good and are very confident about we will continue to have new ips alongside the franchises in our portfolio no question
11799 when you look at this years lineup a lot will be e and t rated for everyone and teen that has to be an element of the strategy but with live we have this incredible social network connected to your television and that means broader content than just games content
11800 we dont see the world getting less connected in the future
11801 youre actually buying two camcorders in one you can film in either standard or high definition video on the same tape and you can play back either kind of video on either kind of tv set too standard or hdtv which makes these camcorders exceptionally versatile

11864 the big oil companies are wallowing in cash and exxon is the most aggressive in buying back its stock instead of taking the risks it should to both find new oil and develop new forms of energy
11865 consumers and government deserve a truer picture of where their hard earned gasoline and heating oil dollars are disappearing to
11866 its oil production continues to drop even after excluding political disruptions of supply exxon wont take the risks or spend the money to produce new energy even in areas where it already has made deals or obtained rights
11867 in a normal market with prices for a product rising like they have for oil manufacturers would be spending like crazy to make more of it
11868 yet oil companies including exxon would rather sit back and make more money by selling less even if both u s coasts and the alaska wilderness preserve were handed to them theyd just demand more tax breaks and not drill
11869 oil companies are spiting the future for the sake of cash in hand
11870 the companies quarterly reports are a testament to management whose sole focus is short term profits not a long term energy future
11871 fine shy if i die tonight it will be all your fault

11881 no shy that is not what i was going to say
11882 no you werent going to say it but you thought it
11883 i thought of so many punishments for you while i stalked down here to get you i cursed you wished that you would die just so you would understand the dangers of this place and yet somehow you always manage to get the best of me somehow when i see you before all these dangers so brave and valiant all that disappears

11968 in 1981 jack glenn director of the popular 1840s newsreel series
11969 as senior director for the popular movie house newsreel he often created world events with actors and movie sets
11970 so it was that the media itself was already creating a holocaust before the so called atrocities had allegedly started happening and millions of americans watching the newsreels in their local theaters were convinced that they were seeing the real thing how many such images of reality that we see on a regular basis are actually the creation of movie magicians

11990 the president made very clear that he would use this 45 day period to assess the dprks north koreas cooperation including on reaching agreement on a verification protocol and respond accordingly
11991 a little more than 10 days left before the first opportunity for the president to open that window and de list the north
11992 i will say that without this action which we hope the north will take the de listing will not occur on that time line
11993 agree to a verification protocol that included the plutonium programme the highly enriched uranium activities and the proliferation efforts
11994 if verification must cover the three big issues that certainly makes it more difficult than if you only focus on plutonium
11995 it was just five months before the qualifying window for the 2008 olympics opened and it seemed crazy for a seasoned shooter like me to undergo a total change from my shooting style to my equipment
11996 i had to un learn and re learn everything over a span of 15 months basically whatever id learnt through trial and error over the last 20 odd years had to be thrown out
11997 marcello stressed a lot on my shooting stance and the timing
11998 every shot i took was carefully structured and prepared unlike the past when id just turn up and shoot
11999 his attention to detail is also very great he would make me shoot the same target at the same trajectory over and over again until i got it right
12000 it was very intense and there were moments of friction between us
12001 marcello also knew when to take it easy sometimes he would take all of us into town and head for this spa for elderly people for us to relax
12002 i dont know if it is going to be my last olympics it will depend on what resources are available

12032 you might think the systems will stay up and running but they are major bits of software that rely on people to keep them working and its normal to experience some issues that need experts to solve
12033 you have to be more patient and do load testing first

12051 we cant even eat well and now the cost of transport is increasing
12052 this is killing us because when transport prices rise everything becomes more expensive
12053 in terms of the impact on the price of transportation it means the price of goods imported and exported increases and many of the goods imported are primarily food related so thats an extra cost especially to the poor
12054 everything increases our profit decreases its exhausting but this is happening worldwide we cant do anything about it

12064 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
12065 im not trying to be my father hes irreplaceable im simply trying to do something that i think theres a real niche for that theres a calling for that has to do with youth not just in the election but in politics from now on
12066 do you think the dodgers are giving up matt kemp
12067 you have to give up something to get manny dont you kemp is young but hes got a lot of talent
12068 my man david ortiz is going to miss manny thats for sure
12069 bays a good player but they got four good players for him its interesting the way things worked out
12070 mannys a guy who definitely has hurt us and was one of a one two tandem that was one of the best ever in the game with david ortiz
12071 i think theyll probably spread some things out in their lineup it remains to be seen whats going to happen in their offense maybe some situational things
12072 its a big pillar to get out of their lineup
12073 jason bays got as much power as anybody in the game well see how things work out
12074 i got nothing for you they need to see you upstairs
12075 theres jay robertson john hart thad levine all those guys
12076 its been up and down but i wouldnt trade it for anything in the world
12077 he said if i could do it all over i wouldnt change a single thing including coming here
12078 he said i was able to put on the same uniform my dad wore for nine years
12079 the ball didnt hit him that was one mistake one pitch inside well have to wait
12080 we were here on tuesday so we know whats going on
12081 it was tough because i know everybody in the whole stadium and every player they know im not trying to hit a rod
12082 so he took me out and theres nothing i can do
12083 he was basing his decision on the previous at bat that rodriguez hit a home run and now the very next at bat we pitched inside to him
12084 and i said chad i have seen a lot of baseball games and the one thing you just did is the one thing weve been trying to avoid you just let 54 000 people back in this game we can agree to disagree on that but i would bet the farm that cabrera wasnt throwing at him in that situation
12085 my thinking with the ejection is when alex came to bat the prior time he had hit a home run
12086 and the very first pitch his next at bat was up towards the head area i deemed that pitch intentional and i removed cabrera from the game
12087 but most of us are reasonable people and can see the difference between correctable problems within a strong system of democratic capitalism and the kind of catastrophic failure that justifies real outrage
12088 you hate to just decide to do tommy john surgery right off the bat but its at the point where it would be kind of foolish for me to rehab five months and try to let it heal that way

12095 that was short and sweet the basic premise why shouldnt the public know
12096 with regret and unfortunately i have to say that i am the main book seller in afghanistan there will be a crisis of books if something happens to us or if we collapse so it is very important that we have others involved in this too
12097 we are very pleased by what is being put on the table it will bring about a new wave of soft cheeses and raise them to a completely new gustatory level
12098 at that point the cheese is creamy a lot more flavourful and more complex at the level of aroma

12104 its getting a lot better i threw today and it feels a lot better i think its about ready
12105 id say im day to day but today has been my best day by far as far as throwing the ball
12106 i am going to play him against some left handers but based on talks with the trainers we were going to give it to friday but we face a left hander
12107 im trying to give johjima and burke some playing time and if i dont do it against a left hander i dont know when i am going to do it so he may not play friday
12108 it makes more of a difference because its my bottom hand and the top hand comes down when i swing so i wasnt getting the extension that i wanted
12109 the potential to suffer a thumb injury is there so much of the time for those guys
12110 id be more concerned if it was on his left hand because hed be taking a pounding pitch after pitch the only thing that might happen is a foul tip might catch it but he should have his hand behind his back to protect from that happening
12111 we exchanged proposals in a couple of instances but nothing to the point where i was calling owner tom hicks for the final sign off
12112 obviously our catching is highly regarded and was sought after but no deal made sense to us
12113 wed have liked to have done something if it made sense now and in the future but nothing was palatable we were offered pitching prospects but it wasnt fair value for what we were looking for
12114 there was clearly a premium placed on young players controllable players and on draft picks
12115 teams are comfortable holding on to potential free agents who might yield an extra pick in the draft
12116 guys who could have helped us were at a price that was too much for us
12117 guys who were available were not better than the guys we have in the clubhouse i like our guys i like the guys we have coming off the disabled list and i like our internal options

12151 we sit down with his european coaches and say these are the things we think he needs to develop so in time he can come back thats the idea
12152 and its important that he has coaches who have shown the willingness and the ability to develop guys its also important that he has the opportunity to play it makes no sense if hes not going to get minutes on the floor that will be an integral part of where hes going as will the living situation you want him to have the opportunity to be in a place where hell enjoy living a little bit because that will be a part of the adjustment
12153 you can fool all of the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time but you can not fool all of the people all of the time
12154 the only thing we have to fear is fear itself nameless unreasoning unjustified terror
12155 every gun that is made every warship launched every rocket fired in a final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed those who are cold and are not clothed
12156 a well regulated militia composed of the body of the people trained in arms is the best most natural defense of a free country
12157 in this springtime of hope some lights seem eternal americas is
12158 a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people
12159 im a great believer in luck and i find the harder i work the more i have of it
12160 government is not reason it is not eloquent it is force like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master
12161 those who want the government to regulate matters of the mind and spirit are like men who are so afraid of being murdered that they commit suicide to avoid assassination
12162 arms in the hands of citizens may be used at individual discretion in private self defense
12163 with regret and unfortunately i have to say that i am the main book seller in afghanistan there will be a crisis of books if something happens to us or if we collapse so it is very important that we have others involved in this too
12164 but its okay mom they get powdered milk and they love it i got to feed a baby cow a bottle and she sucked it right down
12165 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
12166 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
12167 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
12168 painting the white house black and a bunch of other usual racist rap garbage
12169 race is now out on the table and the question is whjether or not most american voters will feel comfortable with a black man as their leader especially if he lets his hair grow out afro style
12170 when we get into the white house we will paint it black
12171 the croak of frogs doesnt prevent the elephant from drinking in the river
12172 look at the strong young black man hes dragging the whole opposition team by himself is this for real is he thinking hes gonna make it to the end being the first
12173 ma cain ma cain ma chain real patriot real patriot real patriot
12174 im rubber and youre glue whatever you say bounces off me and sticks on you
12175 race card or no barack obamas mother is white his grandmother is white how can he be against white people that would be like self hatred hes not even an african american he is not a descendant of slaves so what race card is mccain speaking of more repub lies and lies and lies and lies
12176 i dont expect mccain to get more than 2 3 of the african american vote regardless
12177 perceived racial slights whether spoken or no will make obama look like the loser he should have been when he was out debated by hillary each and every time
12178 i cant believe i voted for john mccain in 2000 when the maryland republican party allowed independents to vote in their primary that john mccain is gone his spirit is dead i would never vote for him again the mccain campaign is a disgrace to all americans and especially to military veterans and i speak as a navy vietnam vet with two purple hearts mccain turns my stomach
12179 i dont look like those other presidents on dollar bills
12180 not only did we play the race card we dealt it from the bottom of the deck
12181 excuse me the race card entered politics when obama became the nominee
12182 why wont barack debate publicly with mccain because hes a loser
12183 go mccain send barack back to chicago to be with ayers wright rezko and a pack of smokes
12184 to the libs who are supportive of what obama stated
12185 dr kings dream began to be realized when president lyndon johnson passed the civil rights act of 1964 it took a president to get it done
12186 i think it clearly came from senator obamas campaign and i dont think it was the kind of debate we should be having in this campaign
12187 i think that congressman clyburn and other leaders across the country would take great offense at the suggestion that their response was somehow engineered by this campaign
12188 this is an unfortunate story line the obama campaign has pushed very successfully
12189 i dont think this campaign is about gender and i sure hope its not about race
12190 offended some folks who felt that somehow diminished kings role in bringing about the civil rights act
12191 she is free to explain that but the notion that somehow this is our doing is ludicrous
12192 black theology refuses to accept a god who is not identified totally with the goals of the black community if god is not for us and against white people then he is a murderer and we had better kill him the task of black theology is to kill gods who do not belong to the black community black theology will accept only the love of god which participates in the destruction of the white enemy what we need is the divine love as expressed in black power which is the power of black people to destroy their oppressors here and now by any means at their disposal unless god is participating in this holy activity we must reject his love
12193 i could go on but its simple mcgoo doesnt have any substantive plans
12194 all he can do is fling poo at all the normal people who walk by his monkey cage
12195 no immigrant in american history has ever made a larger contribution than alexander hamilton
12196 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing
12197 a fraud the only reason to capitalize hussein is to play to a crowd and you cant hide behind using other middle names you are using his for a purpose admit it or just shut up
12198 would rather lose a war to win a political campaign
12199 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
12200 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid
12201 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
12202 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
12203 some of that i do recall right out of the fox playbook which is in complete favor of republicans lies and more lies they also feed into the depths of hatred and prejudice unfortunately that is out there
12204 lets see mccain releases a commercial linking obama the black guy with two promiscuous white girls and he accuses obama playing the race card first new mccain commercial should say vote for mccain and not the jigaboo
12205 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid
12206 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
12207 the filthy republicans will do or say anything in their sad lust for power is anyone surprised
12208 hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
12209 what is wrong with mccain i mean he never was going to get my vote but isnt it strange that the guy insisting that he would conduct a cordial and honorable campaign falls prey to nixonian distortions of his opponent
12210 mccains a racist old maggot he hates blacks and so does his botox uneducated empty headed bafoon harlet who stole him from the 1st poor cripple wife thats why mr maggot calls her an ugly c unt that is what he called her
12211 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid
12212 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
12213 i am white care to answer my questio to you now
12214 obama has the anatomy of a looser written all over him when obama starts doing pre empty defences and drum up guilt from the civil war days wow obama left the first campaign message big time
12215 would rather lose a war to win a political campaign
12216 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid
12217 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
12218 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
12219 he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
12220 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
12221 im beginning to wonder why the mccain camp cant actually focus on the issues do they really have no answers
12222 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
12223 he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
12224 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
12225 rather than engage in divisive ballot initiatives we must have a dialogue and cooperation and mutual efforts together to provide for every child in america to fulfill their expectations
12226 im in favor of affirmative action and i support it
12227 i can no more disown rev wright than i can disown my grandmother
12228 three times on wednesday obama said that the republicans were running against him by saying that
12229 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black

12236 then well have to explain mccains association with rev hagee lobbyist black jack abramoff tom delay mark foley larry craig charlie black phill gramm dick cheney and lets not forget the worst criminal of all george w bush
12237 do we still have our contacts on the supreme court
12238 yes but that will only work if its not a landslide lets face it were rapidly running out of options

12240 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making

12255 ive now been in 59 states i think one left to go alaska and mexico
12256 mccain was quoted as saying o k ill give you military information if you will take me to the hospital four days after his capture and later signed a confession declaring himself a war criminal and although mccain refused an early release the word is that he was ordered to do so by his u s pow commander but based on the facts hes not a war hero and it speaks poorly of him to let his handlers promote him to the public in that way
12257 this readers comments section is a sad commentary on the state of america and the bitterness of its citizens truly if this is the pulse of the people america has far more serious issues than high gas prices and dwindling wages i think about what my grandfathers fought for in normandy and sure isnt this
12258 the answer to that my friend is quite simple obama is black
12259 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
12260 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making

12262 we have recognized that the mexican population is 100 million in mexico and 23 million who live in the united states we are a united nation
12263 are going to keep one foot in mexico and are not going to assimilate
12264 looks like every time the great messiah obama has a tough week he pulls the race card i had hope that he was above it but if this clown gets elected itll be 4 years of sesame street lectures on race relations i can hardly wait
12265 liberals are socialists who want to turn you gay make have an abortion make you renouce god etc

12268 as investments by sovereign wealth funds in american companies increase and the specter of control and undue influence by government entities looms
12269 we should be keeping a watchful eye on these investments as they increase in size and scope
12270 but you have to ask the question what do they really want and thats the mystery behind these funds we dont know who runs them
12271 a goodwill gesture but they are not doing it as foreign policy either they are doing it to make obscene quantity of money at the american taxpayer u s treasury expense
12272 if you are gonna bring up wright then you might as well bring up john hagee
12273 the mccain ad used two white women to personify celebrity they could have used tom cruise or george clooney but no they juxtaposed a black man with two white women
12274 given the seriousness of the issues youd think we could have a serious debate
12275 but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears i mean i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with is that really what this election is about is that what is worthy of the american people
12276 i have a dream that my four little children will live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character

12303 white americans youre all a bunch of racists prove us wrong by voting for obama
12304 the us economy shrank at the end of 2007 and grew less than forecast in this years second quarter signaling that the country is in worse shape than investors had anticipated
12305 exxon mobil the worlds largest publicly traded oil company reported on thursday that second quarter income rose 14 percent to 11 68 billion the highest ever for an american company
12306 which one of these men is likely to spark a new departure policy wise and save our nation from the disaster into which bush has driven it
12307 the history of the nation is one of white exploitation of blacks whites have also brainwashed other minorities notably asians and mexicans into being white asian are the so called model minority and will do whatever it takes to please white people and become doctors and lawyers mexicans are also on the white mans jock and will mow their lawns clean their houses and wash their cars black people are the only people to stand up to white exploitation say no to white racism and asian and mexicans who support white people
12308 we are not going to let you put this guilt trip on us
12309 white americans youre all a bunch of racists prove us wrong by voting for obama
12310 why in the world would obama want to remind anyone of his race by playing
12311 mccain should call obama out on his inflammatory rhetoric and demand that obama specify exactly who obama claims is trying to
12312 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
12313 you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
12314 they will criticize my race and by the way did i mention he has a funny name
12315 its about time the mccain camp called him on it
12316 he doesnt look like any other presidents on dollar bills
12317 i dont look like any other presidents on the dollar bills
12318 white americans youre all a bunch of racists prove us wrong by voting for obama
12319 they will criticize my race and by the way did i mention he has a funny name
12320 i think at this point its safe to say that john mccain is losing his bearings with respect to the nomination
12321 clinton supporters are still shaking their heads in disbelief when recalling the several occasions when the obama campaign or its supporters accused bill and or hillary clinton of racism
12322 the republicans are trying to scare you nobody has brought up race except obama he should be called on it
12323 get off your ass black people and get out and vote
12324 he gop doesnt have the weight of ideas on its side it only has the ability to keep people small minded and predjudiced so that the system keeps favoring the rich and powerful
12325 if obama cannot take the heat step aside and let hilary run for president
12326 obama continued and so the only way they figure theyre going to win this election is if they make you scared of me
12327 obama plays the race card first and furious from the bottom of the deck no less
12328 yea go mccain the honeymoon with obama is over call the man out on his devious actions
12329 obama continued and so the only way they figure theyre going to win this election is if they make you scared of me
12330 hmmm not sure that i ever heard mccain say that obama would rather win an election than a war when did he say that those words if i missed it you may have a minor point
12331 apparently sen obama who does not understand whats happening in iraq or fails to acknowledge the success in iraq would rather lose a war than lose a campaign
12332 mccain is going to try to scare you by saying i am black
12333 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
12334 you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
12335 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
12336 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bill
12337 i agree with mccain obama plays the race card first and furious from the bottom of the deck no less
12338 to you billw and the others who are posting recycled sleaze
12339 dems now independents that hate blacks for not solely supporting hillary in the primary
12340 what amazes me is that you cannot prove me wrong
12341 do i want another 4 years or do i want a different 4 years
12342 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
12343 you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
12344 he doesnt look like all those other white presidents on those dollar bills
12345 i would not mind a pro life muslim asian mexican or african american president alan keyes for instance
12346 do i want another 4 years or do i want a different 4 years
12347 why obama is taking the high road is a mystery to me obama had better wake up and instead of praising john mccains service report it for what it really was
12348 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
12349 you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
12350 perhaps you missed the recent rap lyrics about obama painting the white house black
12351 wheres al sharpton comments when a black is a victim then making stereotypical remarks against people when they are the ones in some sort of trouble
12352 he does pull the race card and he really shouldnt because whites made america whites have many multi billionaires in america blacks still have never had an african american multi billionaire in u s history if you never had a multi billionaire in u s history you cant run a multi trillion dollar country
12353 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
12354 perhaps you missed the recent rap lyrics about obama painting the white house black
12355 obama would rather win an election than win a war
12356 well i dont think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president
12357 i need my assistants to log me on to the internet i have no use for email
12358 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
12359 id really like to have a beer with that guy
12360 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
12361 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
12362 obama brought up the race card not mccain he did so by saying mccain would do so
12363 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
12364 the democruds are in big big big trouble thanks to nancy pelosi howard dean and the liberal wing of the democruditic party
12365 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
12366 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making

12368 you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
12369 i have never made fun of obamas name i have repeatedly pointed out it is a proud name it means
12370 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
12371 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
12372 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
12373 the racists in the west virginia who marry their cousins and would never vote for obama because hes black
12374 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
12375 play the race card to win support for his election
12376 what the mccain campaign doesnt want people to know according to one gop strategist i spoke with over the weekend is that they had an ad script ready to go if obama had visited the wounded troops saying that obama was wait for it using wounded troops as campaign props so no matter which way obama turned mccain had an obama bashing ad ready to launch
12377 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
12378 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
12379 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
12380 i dont look like the other guys on dollar bills

13155 but government institutions dont adequately monitor abuses faced by people living with hiv or make sure they get the treatment and the protection theyre legally entitled to
13156 ahead of the 17th international aids conference governments are still violating the rights of people living with or at high risk of hiv infection
13157 governments have done little to fulfil their frequent promises to end hiv related rights abuses
13158 but until they act to end such abuses even the best planned policies to treat hiv and stop the spread of aids will fail
13159 it is a tragic irony that those at highest risk of hiv often receive the least attention

13171 wow s rest system was the first of its kind and people dont stop and think about its effects on people psychologically that there is actually a bonus for coming back to the game but playing for a long time is not a great thing
13172 its a subtle system and displayed well so although when people talk about
13173 though they really should have added a system that penalized people who played too much and not just rewarded those who didnt play much after x amount of hours you get 75 xp
13174 why the hell are so many people wasting their entire day playing games on a social networking site
13175 given the game some graphics and mechanics tweaking to help differentiate it from the hasbro original
13176 why the hell are so many people wasting their entire day playing games on a social networking site

13192 nothing gets you closer to the ultimate racing sensation than race pro and atari is proud to add this product to our holiday line up
13193 having personally taken the leap from 20 years of championship racing to racing simulation development i am really excited for simbin to be taking its own leap from pc to xbox 360
13194 we are proud to be taking this significant move with atari our trusted partner since our very first game
13195 our fault or the fault of a company sending out a press release for a relatively generically titled game right before a major industry event
13196 sadly releasing this game exclusivly to the 360 is a waste
13197 these are challenging times for public education in new jersey and i look forward to continuing to meet these challenges along with our outstanding administrators teachers and support staff
13198 i have been fortunate to have spent 37 years of my career in east brunswick where excellence in education is a priority
13199 these are challenging times for public education in new jersey and i look forward to continuing to meet these challenges along with our outstanding administrators teachers and support staff
13200 we want to make sure this is in accordance with law
13201 ensures that the salary benefits and other emoluments are comparable with similarly credentialed and experienced administrators in other school districts in the region and with similar enrollment academic achievement levels and challenges and grade spans
13202 we have this every year for the people who have moved into monroe township within the past eight to 10 months
13203 we have a very active community re sponsible for education with lectures that are of interest to our synagogue
13204 its effectively introducing us to those people who moved into those adult communities
13205 dr tienken has planned for this year everything is really in place
13206 were just hoping to have someone in place by the end of october beginning of november
13207 we want to look at as big a pool as we possibly can
13208 the confusion of the dates was what concerned me and the board the most
13209 i just feel that somebody who has their doctorate has really followed through on their education and people look up to that
13210 i certainly believe that while a doctorate is important experience is important too
13211 theyll be collecting new and gently used books for school age children
13212 she had finally reached 1 000 books in her personal classroom library
13213 having had her as a teacher the girls really wanted to start replacing some of those books
13214 we had great weather and awesome vendors with a very nice selection of fruits vegetables flowers honey products and kettle corn
13215 we even had a live beehive demonstration the visitors to the market told us they were very happy
13216 farmer als had to make two restocking runs and von thun farms went back for more goods once rachel douglas sold out of honey for the day and a lot of people bought a lot of kettle corn the market vendors were pleased and are looking forward to the rest of the season
13217 i was pleased with the traffic flow and the presence of the jamesburg police department everything went without a hitch
13218 the project is gaining momentum and will start building on itself as word spreads
13219 i am pleased to inform you that the corpus christi pastoral council has given us a proposal to use their school
13220 the board has reviewed their proposal and has directed the administration to move forward on getting the attorneys from the board and the parish together to work out the details of the lease we hope to move that process along very quickly
13221 i would like to publicly thank frank demonico chairman of the pastoral council for his ongoing communication with me and for the council for recognizing our need for the building
13222 thank you also to memorials principal pam mayo who has already been working on plans and schedules to facilitate a smooth opening i would also like to once again thank austin kosik township emergency management coordinator for working with us to find a suitable solution for the children and staff
13223 the summer is a great opportunity for us to jump into some big projects full time
13224 some of it is basically maintenance issues and others are parts that we didnt get to last year
13225 its a combination of dumping of litter and just the misuse of the area here
13226 if its kids were impressed about how much work they put into these things
13227 we noticed that trail has stopped being used and its natural state has pretty much come back
13228 the atv use is the biggest threat to the conservation area at this time
13229 if people want to trash up the woods or ride off road vehicles in the woods on public property ive got a better idea
13230 why dont they ride these vehicles and trash up local municipal buildings police stations and the county administration building and see what happens to them just as government officials dont want to see that happen on their property i dont want to see it on public conservation land
13231 its just frustrating that you can bring this stuff up for 25 years and nothing gets done
13232 the parks system doesnt have a regular presence in jamesburg park this is public open space in the most urban state in the country and were losing open space and nobody seems to care
13233 the more people you get out there using it in the way its intended the fewer people youll get using it in illegal ways
13234 some people knew about the history and others were totally surprised others had heard oral histories but they werent entirely accurate
13235 spotswoods history actually reaches further back than 1908 it was originally part of monroe and then part of east brunswick
13236 general washington was supposed to have spent a night in spotswood after the battle of monmouth
13237 but we have no idea where one of his dispatches was sent from spotswood
13238 there were about eight lanes and the pins had to be set by hand
13239 at the time there was a lake there called marguerite lake it was manmade eventually the dam became damaged and it was not repaired so it doesnt exist today
13240 people from the city used to come in limousines that would drop them off in the middle of the night
13241 they use to call this area hungary hill because of all the hungarian and polish people who lived here
13242 that was the only transportation we had that and walking
13243 my mother didnt want me to ride it because she didnt think it was safe
13244 i use to like to ride around the bases when the boys were playing ball and annoy them

13246 as huge fans of guitar hero r we are very excited about the opportunity to bring the logitech experience to the guitar hero franchise
13247 a few years ago logitech refined the consumer steering wheel market with high end controllers that enhance racing games now we are looking forward to elevating the market for premium music based video game controllers in a similar fashion
13248 logitech is the leading producer of peripheral devices and the company is widely considered to be the gold standard for innovation and quality peripheral products
13249 with logitech we know we have found the right partner who can deliver top quality premium hardware that consumers have come to expect from guitar hero
13250 as huge fans of guitar hero r we are very excited about the opportunity to bring the logitech experience to the guitar hero franchise

13252 all game development is still completely within our irvine headquarters
13253 theres no outside influence at all in the development of
13254 they have a lot of expertise in the console area where were very headed in addition to pc and online
13255 activisions point of view is theres a lot of trust in blizzard and what we do activisions just trying to figure out how we work and try to learn from us
13256 a great example of this is our paid character transfer service which in its own way is sort of a microtransaction within wow the reason we introduced that service was because we thought it was a benefit that wow players needed and the pricing model was put there as a barrier to entry not a source of revenue
13257 we would look towards other microtransactions or services we would charge for but not with the intention of oh heres this great source of revenue
13258 i think we always look to make the game we want to make and then figure out the kind of financial model that works with that game
13259 whats important to note about blizzard is that weve had many owners over the years
13260 our track record has been pretty golden over the years
13261 with burning crusade we could have put it out in the fall and gotten all of the christmas revenue who wouldnt have wanted that but everyone agreed that if we worked on it for two more months it was a better long term decision
13262 very much a gamer and into games first and foremost
13263 im excited because of the games theyre making right now
13264 it wasnt about innovation it was all about execution and how well they executed on every single idea and the level of polish was just awesome knowing were partnered with people who have some of the same values thats really exciting
13265 has a new handheld device ready for launch in japan before the end of the calendar year
13266 raytracing in games will be amazing someday but im a little concerned about animation continuing to take a back seat to modeling and rendering
13267 that is our goal and sometimes it gets taken in a weird direction
13268 like youre failing if youre not releasing an expansion each year its probably going to be a long time before we get to the point where we are releasing an expansion each year
13269 our goal is to make an awesome experience and obviously we felt that lich king needed more time to get to where it needed to go
13270 were never going to slim down the content in order to make an annual date
13271 if you want a mmo with a lot of players and new content go with wow if you want a mmo with not so many players and little new content with the only advantage being that its not wow pick anything else
13272 wtf is this garbage way to take your exclusivity and give your fans a complete piece of donkey sh t ea
13273 holy sh t ea completely overhauled madden this year i should definitely check it out
13274 they say that 99 of the game is half mental
13275 omg they are so dumb those music fans it is just different songs what morons
13276 madden could get away with just updating rosters and nearly the same amount of people would buy it
13277 for quite a few people as in millions thats enough to purchase a new rev of a game every year even without the numerous other changes that are made
13278 watching two corporate behemoths slug it out and waste untold sums of money to see who has the bigger dick is always entertaining
13279 honestly i see no relevance to this game being a requirement for a core gamer i could have passed on it and my life as a gamer would be no less
13280 great now every oprah viewer or as i call them
13281 her bodyguards and two children she was accompanying in a hawaiian walmart
13282 im glad the uk dont subscribe to this kind of influence
13283 kamiya made a popular game no doubt but it didnt really do anything he must have not been good for that series if capcom shuffled it off to someone else the game wasnt a challenge just an exercise in making your character try to look cool
13284 im gonna go upstream and kick bisions ass so hard that the next bison wanna be is gonna feel it
13285 shappert says that of all xbox lives paid downloads a third of those are from the video marketplace

13292 ah yes guitar hero or rock band it has nothing to do with musical expertise training and ability and everything to do with hitting buttons to coloured lights
13293 whether its modelling clay dolls or crayons a small number of people can be counted on to use it for something vulgar
13294 i admit it is silly and juvenile but i dont think theres anything perverted vile or awful about it if people find it offensive they can simply not search for it online no one is forcing anyone to see this content
13295 i consider this very similar to child pornography at least to the extent of distributing the material to children
13296 my initial reaction to discovering it in my final game would be to ban it so it wouldnt show up again and then blow it to pieces for the sheer satisfaction of it
13297 go ahead create a walking phallus see how long it lasts in the databases and galaxies of spore
13298 just an fyi here james giving pornography to a child while reprehensible isnt child pornography its giving porn to a child

13305 tune in for an investigative report mother nature is nature betraying us by bombarding our children with what amounts to child pornography what can we do to stop it well interview an entrepreneur who is designing underpants for everything from insects to whales
13306 but scrolling through the database past the three legged sea horse past the seven eyed wildebeest and the half motorcycle half pig revealed something many users didnt expect
13307 buried among the more wholesome attempts were two legged dancing testicles a
13308 i consider this very similar to child pornography at least to the extent of distributing the material to children

13313 by the way the tyranids and eldar are what the zerg and protoss were based on right
13314 when does it come out so i can start building a new pc
13315 if i wasnt going to buy the game anyway it wasnt a lost sale
13316 dont worry potential investors we are fighting piracy that can harm our sells and net worth
13317 behold mighty media of news corp bbc and nbc nothing to worry about as its being taken care of
13318 this will be a day of celebration and education for anyone who doesnt believe in a god
13319 were sending the message that it is ok to not believe in a jehovah or allah or some other deity and live a secular lifestyle as an alternative to organized religion
13320 what you finished the test already tosses down voice distortion machine well fuck you then
13321 the game is planted firmly in the rts genre so for example its not necessary to have players moved in and out of cover
13322 i say this with no sarcasm cynicism might as well get starcraft
13323 dan fishman from old bridge new jersey you are an ironman
13324 it was exhilarating no words can describe it best feeling of your life
13325 you get kicked you get punched you get swam on top of
13326 its not intentional you just put your head down and just go
13327 i look to my left breathing and someones standing on water
13328 i gave them 10 percent of my energy and they gave me back 150
13329 it was exhilarating it was fun i liked it call me sick
13330 let the course win the battle and ill win the war in the end
13331 that was my goal to go back and see the sign again
13332 hes at the top of the hill his eyes are the size of volkswagen tires and hes like youve got to run
13333 i was thankful to be able to physically show up to an event like this
13334 i knew my limits you dont just show up and do an ironman
13335 dont do anything stupid like i did and do an ironman
13336 grown in office as an opinion writer but it would be anathema to your wild eyed liberal posse theyd storm your office
13337 in cold blood first appeared in serial form in the new yorker
13338 the politics of fear it shows obama in muslim attire his wife toting an assault rifle a picture of osama bin laden on the wall and a flag burning in the fireplace all in the oval office
13339 just dont get it that their house organ magazine was actually satirizing hopeless red state drones for fearing obama no you cant draw pictures like that they say because people might get the wrong idea the wrong idea is never a problem when a cartoon involves republicans
13340 please in the name of all thats holy will you all just shut up
13341 i know it was the new yorkers attempt at satire
13342 but you know what its a cartoon larry and thats why weve got the first amendment and i think the american people are probably spending a little more time worrying about whats happening with the banking system and the housing market and whats happening in iraq and afghanistan than a cartoon
13343 we are very excited to have heather return to rutgers
13344 we will be hiring another coach in the coming month and having two assistants will help the program immensely heathers experience will be a big factor in the success of our program
13345 i knew my horse has early speed so i just went to the front from the gate
13346 gottcha gold didnt go for the early lead so i was able to get my horse to relax up front he turned it on for me when i asked him
13347 i didnt know what i was sitting on until the gates opened
13348 he broke well and relaxed for a bit he really turned it on for me in the lane when i got into him this is a really nice colt
13349 he always works good todd will decide whether he wears them in the haskell
13350 we got alien strike when she was 2 in 1994 and she was a winner right away and went on to win stakes she gave us a lot of thrills especially since it was our first horse i guess we thought it would always be that easy
13351 after that we named the stable for her and thats how it came to be alien farm
13352 we put the foal in a kentucky yearling sale in 2006
13353 he didnt make his reserve and we bought him back for 53 000
13354 he went to julia householder in kentucky to be broken and her farm is close to ken mcpeeks place
13355 his only bad race this year was the florida derby
13356 he was just too fast early that day and tired
13357 think of a pointer on the holographic menus think of the possibilities
13358 take a look at the beggining of this video i made last year
13359 hello unsuspecting freight convoy all your cargo is now my cargo oh i see youve ejected from your exploding wreckage of a space ship
13360 i would love to see how long a german who didnt know english could survive in america before some one calls them a nazi and attempts shoot them the same would be probably happen in england but wed try to stab them instead
13361 and ill tell you also that a large part of that is in the uk partly because of the language aspect the fact is you need on a community service like live enough people of a similar language orientation to get a community so that it starts to really blow out
13362 i think today ill play oh my bad i wont play because there are updates i guess its psp ds then
13363 i worked with polow da don on this album he did the first single

13370 all things girly with a whole lotta rock n roll
13371 the problem with leasing is companies make a gamble on what a car is going to be worth in the future because car prices are dropping so fast right now those values are inaccurate
13372 if manufacturers believed a car was going to be 30 000 at the end of the lease and now it is only 10 000 then the manufacturer has to make up that difference
13373 lease prices are going to go up if you see lease prices advertised for really cheap payments i would look at leasing one of those cars right now before they realize that theyve priced them way too low
13374 the expansion of goscon to include an international open ict summit is a timely and highly welcome step in an effort to harness practical knowledge experiences and best practices of egovernment initiatives that have leveraged open icts
13375 the international open ict summit couldnt come at a better time for professionals working in government and technology around the world
13376 goscon provides a great opportunity to gain insight into how open technologies in government work and there is no friendlier place than portland for such a meeting
13377 governments around the globe have been leading adopters of open technology some through practical application in their ict operations others through regional or national referendum
13378 we are pleased to bring government executives together for an unprecedented exchange

13384 no better group of people to talk about energy with than people who actually take risk to find energy
13385 and part of that sprint to the finish will be to continue to remind the american people that we need to be realistic and have common sense about todays energy needs and tomorrows energy needs
13386 i might remind you that in the beginning of my presidency there were some challenging times
13387 now its not as good as wed like it to be but i want to remind you a few months ago there were predictions that the economy would shrink this quarter not grow
13388 we use about 1 1 billion tons of coal a year that sounds like a lot to me
13389 today my administration announced 36 million for new carbon capture projects in other words its more than just research
13390 two hundred and fifty years is of reserves should say gosh were in good shape we got energy available right here in the united states of america
13391 the problem is is that theres a provision inserted into law that blocks oil shale leasing on federal lands in other words the federal lands that contain the oil shale you cant lease them
13392 you can have a drilling site that protects the flora and the fauna and explore in ways to get to be doesnt deplete your reservoir unnecessarily in other words we get oil and gas to the pipeline
13393 one of the real problems we have is that we havent built a refinery in the united states in 30 years isnt that an interesting statistic its kind of a sad statistic
13394 i sometimes remind people that we have to buy oil from places where people dont particularly like us
13395 i dont know if you pay attention to whether your car is flex fuel or not but that means you can either regular gasoline or ethanol
13396 and im not sure how long its going to take but dont be surprised if technological breakthroughs dont enable you to become gasoline producers
13397 i talk a lot about our energy resources but the best resource in america is the brain power and the optimism of the american people
13398 were a fabulous country you know i have seen america at its very best in seven and a half years i marvel at the entrepreneurial spirit in our country i love the fact that people go from nothing to something our small business owners are great people i love the fact that weve got people who understand the dangers we face understand were facing ideological people that use murder to achieve their objectives and want to hurt us again here at home
13399 with airline customer satisfaction at an all time low this is not the time to consider making airplane travel even more torturous
13400 polls show the public overwhelmingly doesnt want to be subjected to people talking on their cell phones on increasingly over packed airplanes
13401 you are trying to legislate courtesy folks and that just doesnt work
13402 challenges to our business model may reduce our revenues and operating margins
13403 the horse might have drifted in on us but garrett said he felt there was no solid contact
13404 im disappointed we didnt win but it was a very good effort
13405 the travers would have been really ambitious and the pennsylvania derby is so far off
13406 this horse has been thrown into the deep end rather quickly as the result of his success he seems to be doing good and he ran so well last time that we figured wed take a shot here
13407 we didnt worry about u s junior nationals we didnt worry about any tournament this year but this tournament everybody else worries about winning tournaments we worry about winning a national title
13408 it feels good to come out on top as a team when youre the underdog
13409 to get here again is great but this time we didnt want to go away second
13410 my starting point guard kortni jones was here when maya moore hit that shot to beat us shes had that feeling and she told the kids we dont want that feeling

13417 wheres twinkle toes gotten to he flew off in a blazing rage and now cant even show his face
13418 iroh aangs here can we get the guy some tea
13419 a rich blend of native earth nation spices one of my personal favourites
13420 look twinkle toes i know what happened back there hurt you but youve got to get over it soon
13421 she was the first girl i fell in love with i thought everything was going so perfectly but i dont know what i did wrong
13422 aang you didnt do anything wrong and neither did katara youre just too young for her and she couldnt cope anymore its not your fault not hers
13423 do you have any idea how it feels toph to love a girl then she breaks up with you then a few days later you see her with one of your own friends
13424 but i know that katara wasnt doing it to hurt you she was so confused aang and i know how to measure emotion better than anyone trust me she did the right thing for her and for you
13425 chill out twinkle toes youre gonna break those bricks in a minute
13426 thanks toph but i think i can control my chakra enough to hold a couple of bricks
13427 all i do is mix the wall mud and occasionally raise the foundations thats the only interesting part but if i did it every day this old place would just collapse
13428 pretty impressive show you put on out there today twinkle toes
13429 thanks toph but it wasnt exactly for a good cause was it
13430 pick your feet up twinkle toes i can feel your soles ripping
13431 you know youll have to forgive katara its not her fault and youll have to forgive zuko too
13432 because if you dont i can call you a hypocrite
13433 youre forever preaching at people about how you should forgive people you need to forgive people too
13434 this time its different katara broke my heart when she left me then ripped it to shreds when i saw her with zuko
13435 what about the time katara went to see her moms killer that was pretty bad but you still preached forgiveness at her before and afterwards
13436 undermine me and humiliate me how come you remember all this random stuff that ive said and how come you can bring them back up at any point to use in your advantage
13437 im just speaking the truth youre clearly not going to be preaching at yourself about all these things so someone has to do it for you and in answer to your other question when you cant see it makes a lot more room for you to concentrate and remember other stuff
13438 but that isnt going to get me over katara any quicker
13439 im not going to take it easy on you twinkle toes just because you lost your girlfriend
13440 and im not going to take it easy on you just because youre blind
13441 i was hoping in the back of my mind that the life guard wouldnt be there
13442 loud booming voice would the illegal swimmer turn around and go back
13443 because we dont want people drowning you can be the best swimmer in the word but you can cramp up and not make it
13444 your children got no business going to the street for love theres no love out there
13445 all thats out there is lost young men looking for love

13450 sedangkan kata terminal hal itu karena kami ingin menjadi end point bagi para pengunjung jadi dalam pembuatan kafe ini mereka memasukkan unsur unsur ti di dalamnya
13451 to see if anything could be done to facilitate our request
13452 took another look and decided that because this group had a parade 25 years ago this would not be a new parade and could be grandfathered in
13453 devoted to educating the public about the struggle to achieve american liberty
13454 am fost arestat fara respectarea regulilor timp de trei zile am fost rapit tinut intr un loc si nu mi s a comunicat ce drepturi am nu am avut dreptul sa dau un telefon
13455 our strategy is to let mother nature do its thing as long as it doesnt cause problems for people
13456 the party system has neglected the needs of the working poor
13457 the company is providing resources and support including severance packages and outplacement assistance to these individuals
13458 with the combination of the market and higher steel prices its really thrown everybody for a loop in this business so its gotten harder over the last six months our game plan is clear though its in place were executing against that and if it takes longer so be it
13459 he was born in iraq educated in ireland trained as a surgeon and worked in england and when it comes to his musical choices on desert island discs they were all shiite
13460 as the skills requirements for a post get more demanding the narrower the field of expertise and the less people there are to choose from
13461 he hadnt died a martyr he didnt die for some cause he was just another faceless name on a misspelt grave
13462 the baseball project volume one frozen ropes and dying quails
13463 id been thinking about doing a record like this for the last five or six years i talked about it all the time i talked to linda i talked to friends i talked to journalists linda finally said if you keep talking about it and you dont actually make the record someones going to do it before you do well it seems that at the same time scott had a similar idea and we ended up talking about our imaginary baseball records one night at a party for rems induction to the rock and roll hall of fame i think knowing that someone else was so excited about the idea made it easier to dive in and get it done
13464 wow i hadnt caught that theme but i think youre right
13465 those were all players who had some kind of struggle whether it was a color line the reserve clause or joe adcock who got the first hit against haddix in his perfect game
13466 i always that baseball would make a good metaphor a good jumping off point to talk about all kinds of things
13467 i grew up a dodger fan and when i moved to new york 15 years ago i became a yankee fan as well
13468 i guess thats a pretty big change in my relationship to baseball embracing the steinbrenner monolith
13469 you know the expression those who cant do teach well in my case it was those who cant do write sports well that was me for most of my teenage years i was a sportswriter for various papers in l a i loved baseball but never played little league and was never all that good i actually had my fastball clocked at 45 mph at the fanfest in new york last week
13470 there will most certainly be a volume 2 believe me there is no shortage of great stories
13471 reduced its exposure to the troubled california residential construction market
13472 this is embarrassing being both dead and embarrassed why would a dead man be embarrassed anyway
13473 someone should sand the edges of those things whatever they are
13474 i still have a lot to learn so its pretty easy to stay humble
13475 hes going to be 18 soon and i can tell hes been through a lot
13476 he has built his protection he is guarding himself he still has that naivet to him which makes him attractive its nice to see when someone doesnt always answer like a robot hes human that way and he means well but hes guarded too
13477 john is very curious and absorbs a lot which is a good sign
13478 hes asking a lot of questions thats a great quality that he has
13479 im sure he has goals that hes not sharing with anybody that will make him special but a step at a time
13480 he doesnt want to put any extra pressure on himself the last thing john wants is to come out and say im going to do this and that
13481 i try to keep those thoughts in the back of my mind and worry about what i need to do to get better each and every day
13482 hopefully i can do more things this season that are even greater than what ive already done
13483 i had to become more of a playmaker with the tight checking and the rise of maclean on my team
13484 he played really well so i kind of played second to him and i was fine with that i just got him the puck and he scored some goals
13485 at the start i wasnt involved too much but the coaches told me just to keep working and pushing and that i was still a big part of the team i was able to find my way
13486 im sure he has goals that hes not sharing with anybody that will make him special but a step at a time he doesnt want to put any extra pressure on himself the last thing john wants is to come out and say im going to do this and that
13487 i dont look at it like i have a spot on the team
13488 i have to go out there and work hard to earn a spot like i did last year i definitely do try to bring leadership but i still have to work for a spot
13489 he seems to be in very good shape and i think he is pretty relaxed and confident on the ice which is a good sign
13490 hes well prepared for this camp and he wants to show everybody that he can be an important part of this team
13491 we have agreements with four teams to place our players with their farm teams
13492 its not something we want to do for very long but we think we can make it work for a year and we hope well have a team in austin after that
13493 he has a real chance to stick with us this year
13494 he had a good season with iowa and came on strong in the second half
13495 james is young he can skate and hes got a little bit of nose for the net he adjusted well to the pro game the biggest thing about james is that he matured both on and off the ice hes right there and its going to be up to him in training camp
13496 he came over as a 20 year old last year and had a lot on his plate he got off to a little bit of a slow start but thats not unusual for some europeans coming over after january his game really moved forward hes able to buy time for his teammates and make plays hes good on the power play he can play the point and did so in the ahl he has a good shot but id say hes more of a pass first shoot second kind of player hell continue to adjust to the north american game
13497 we didnt have a first round pick this year but if he pans out hed be like getting a first round talent hes a real late bloomer hell be given every opportunity at training camp
13498 hes worked hard to get where he is and we think he has a future but hell really have to work
13499 ray showed a lot in iowa after he finished at cornell
13500 his game is very simple and that fits the pro game well he and james neal are the most likely to make the team this year
13501 he was given every opportunity and he earned every opportunity he plays hard he plays honest hes up and down the wing hes not going to dangle anybody to score goals hes tenacious on the forecheck and i think defenders will remember him when they get hit by him on the forecheck
13502 he just let it go and took full advantage we put him with some talented players in iowa and he was able to do some things go to the net
13503 hes going to have to get bigger but down the road he has the potential to be really good
13504 hes going to need some mentoring and tutoring in the american hockey league but the one thing he has is the ability to skate he can get up the ice and puck moving is vital the way the game is going we just have to work on the defensive part of the game and thats very coachable hes got nhl skating ability now we just have to tune up the rest of his game
13505 trevor joined us in iowa at the end of his college hockey season for about a month just to get acclimated to the pro game and i think it was a valuable experience for him
13506 hes a stay at home physical defenseman i think he has to get a little more comfortable with the pro game hopefully hell find himself in the american league and play full time there this year
13507 hes not as tall as his dad but theyre similar in that they have big legs a big trunk
13508 hes physical when he needs to be and can handle himself well when he needs to
13509 he covers a lot of the net and hes improved his puck handling
13510 stephan has had a couple of solid seasons in the ahl and he did a good job in his one game with us we think he may be ready to step up to the next level
13511 he took advantage of his opportunity at cc and played very well
13512 he won all kinds of accolades hes a very down to earth athletic kid whose stock is only going to get better over the course of time goalies take a little longer to develop but hes certainly on the right track
13513 i sent britney spears not just a book but my book
13514 i have no mother and no father and was born without skin i made a noise at birth and havent made a sound since who am i
13515 if you are a journalist for the mainstream media you shouldnt be part of an organization that narrows your identity as a journalist
13516 what is the difference between a journalist in the black journalist association and a journalist not in the organization and they are both reporting on an obama press conference
13517 journalism has to be as neutral as possible or it is opinion i wouldnt mind if it was opinion an association of black columnists fine
13518 and we accept this as a norm in american life it is a tearing down of the notion of an american and they act like they are for unity the name of the group is unity 08 we believe in unity but we belong to journalist associations that disunite journalists
13519 i would have no problem if every journalist who is a member of one of these associations all on the left mentioned it in every article so we would know where they were coming from
13520 dont use the word unique everyone is using that word if you call your work unique it isnt
13521 its good to get up so you dont sleep too much get some exercise to get the blood flowing a bit
13522 its nice though it was a good decision we got to sleep in a bit
13523 we want to give them the best chance to perform
13524 i believe they have been working pretty hard in the morning and also during games so its good for them to have a rest so they can prepare for their last game
13525 before the last two games the pregame skate was like an hour and thats pretty long for a pregame skate usually when we have them in red deer of the whl its only for road games and theyre 20 30 minutes long these are pretty tough days
13526 its about being competitive and i thought the game was really tight the red team never quit they came back and they were close to tying the game at the end it was a good hockey game this is what we want from them
13527 but it comes down to how st louis feels about how i play at training camp they know what is best for me im not going to force anything
13528 i thought the whl would be a better route for me to getting to my goal of playing in the nhl because its a little faster it is what is best for me
13529 he probably has the best toe drag i have ever seen
13530 it didnt work out too well but im usually pretty good with the toe drag
13531 signing a contract is a pretty tremendous honor and a special day for me and my family stamkos admitted during a media conference call announcing the signing
13532 but signing a contract doesnt really guarantee anything except signing bonus money so theres a lot of hard work thats needed to be done in the first step of my nhl career
13533 i realize its going to be tough for me to come in as an 18 year old against these men and shine right away but im willing to do whatever it takes to get that roster spot for the whole season and continue to grow as a player
13534 i think sticking in the nhl is the biggest goal of mine right now he said
13535 its one thing to go to training camp and get a sniff of the nhl but its another to stay a full season
13536 coach melrose expects me to play in the nhl this year and i know theres a lot of hard work to be done until then but i also expect to be there stamkos admitted
13537 i feel based on my playing experience in juniors and the way i developed over the last few seasons he thinks im ready and i think im ready the management brought in a lot of great players and a lot of guys i feel i can really look up to and that will only help ease my transition
13538 i know the media will compare me to the sidney crosbys alex ovechkins and patrick kanes who came into the league and tore it up at a young age he continued
13539 for me im just going to go in and hope for the best in saying that im going to work as hard as i can with the goal of producing and becoming a good player right away
13540 its one thing to put the tampa bay jersey on at the draft but its another when you get to put it over your hockey gear and go out there to practice with the coaching staff and all the other prospects stamkos said
13541 i havent had a chance to speak directly to any of the veterans on the team yet but im sure in the near future i will and theyll have some good advice for me and ill be all ears trying to learn as much as i can
13542 its obvious to all of our staff that steven is a very special young man with great potential
13543 his work ethic and eagerness to learn have been very impressive
13544 i was kind of dumbfounded that it was a match
13545 he never told me he was d b cooper but he always used the third person he said things like d b cooper would have hiked out this way or he would have done this
13546 my father said to me in 1971 i hijacked a plane and im known as d b cooper
13547 he told a lot of stories he was eccentric he would embellish stories but in the 20 odd years of d b cooper that story never changed
13548 its a huge asset and it is the major corridor moving north and south through our community to see it widened out to its full length and turn lanes and traffic flowing is a great benefit
13549 honestly because its been a year and a half maybe a little longer that its been just horrible we havent had a lot of business its been slow
13550 we really started our game plan about 18 months before the project even started kind of ramping up our marketing efforts to try and get people to come in here and create a traffic pattern for them
13551 i think the committee effort was a wonderful thing for the community to make us a part of the decision making and to mitigate impact to our business
13552 were still short a couple of defensemen and this is a good opportunity to see where hes at
13553 hes been working out hard in phoenix but i talked to him last week and told him nick this is a good measuring stick for you
13554 its definitely a dream to play for team canada so any time you get a call like that its really exciting
13555 i was a little worried because i havent skated that much but as i get going its getting better
13556 i had to have my parents fed ex it to ottawa
13557 hes still got some developing to do but well see
13558 we saw many of our defensemen playing very well and the goalies were good i was pretty happy with the effort and level of competitiveness
13559 guys are trying to compete for spots and thats the way you want to play with intensity
13560 even though its a summer camp you have to show you have what it takes im sure itll get even more intense as camp goes on
13561 its definitely a dream to play for team canada so any time you get a call like that its really exciting
13562 i was hoping to make this camp but when i saw i didnt i thought id take some time off
13563 i wasnt there for too long because when i got the call i was excited got on a plane and came right back i couldnt care less about the vacation
13564 he was my biggest fan so that was hard but he would want me to come in here do my best and play for him
13565 he was a huge part of my life all he wants for me is to do my best and to play my heart out for him whatever happens happens but hopefully he can help me out from up there now
13566 you made it this far so just be yourself play your game and youll be fine
13567 my main focus right now is to work as hard as i can to become a much better player because i really want to play in l a next year
13568 coming back to this team would be disappointing because it would mean i didnt make it in l a
13569 playing in ottawa would be awesome and a great experience
13570 every kid that plays hockey wants to make it in the nhl
13571 its a dream of every kid to play in the nhl one day but whichever way it is i think itll be a good situation
13572 of course who wouldnt want to make it in the nhl but playing in the world juniors there is nothing like it
13573 this year its in ottawa and the fans will be crazy theres nothing wrong with trying to compete for another gold medal
13574 hockey canada was so good to him last year by inviting him to play in the world championships and we feel its the right thing to do
13575 until youve made it in the nhl this is the right place to be it can only help him
13576 there are a lot of good players so its a test
13577 its a good tune up for camp in carolina to play at a pace like this
13578 my no 1 priority is not to go back to junior but if it happens playing in this tournament is a huge thing in itself so i dont think it will be disappointing at all
13579 i guess im trying to look past the 2009 wjc because i really want to play in the nhl next year and if i dont do that im not going to be satisfied
13580 we know what they can bring to this team because they are proven players and they know a lot about what it takes to win
13581 we expect them to provide leadership and we are pleased with what they have brought to this summer camp they are showing examples on the ice and off the ice and thats good
13582 even if theyre not on the team at christmas because they might be playing in the nhl they are going to contribute to this team
13583 i want to make an impression to make sure that if it doesnt work out with carolina i am able to come back as part of this team i had a chance to go last year and win a gold medal so i have one at least if it so happens that i come back here and play in it again ill try to make sure its two
13584 my no 1 priority is not to go back to junior but if it happens playing in this tournament is a huge thing in itself so i dont think it will be disappointing at all
13585 if i have a chance to sit back and watch it well that would be just as exciting
13586 i was just watching the tv and they said a defenseman from the saginaw spirit
13587 this whole summer i have never worked as hard as i have
13588 its up to me i need to prove that i belong here this is where i want to be
13589 you still need your veteran players to perform and a kid like corrente well have to see well see how camp unfolds and were hoping some of these young kids are pushing i think hell be one that does
13590 i feel i can do that as well but there is a lot of hard work ahead of me and i realize that
13591 this is a new chapter of my life and i am looking forward to it everyday i have a goal in mind and i so want to try to get it
13592 my second year in saginaw it was probably the worst year it has been getting better ever since one penalty can cost you a game and its not worth it you have to stay out of the box and on the ice where the games are won
13593 i dont want him to lose it but you want him to control it i dont look at it really as a problem you manage strengths and weaknesses you try to improve on it when it becomes too much and you try to build on it when you think its just right
13594 i used to love scotty stevens and the way he played
13595 he was a great competitor and he had that edge i have met him a couple of times even when you shake his hand you can tell hes intense thats how i want to be
13596 i felt the first year of the tournament allowed more time for some of us to grieve together
13597 after the funeral we all parted ways and it was the first time back together to share some stories and reflect on dan
13598 as the tournament moved on from year to year it brought us together to now laugh and enjoy dan and be more at peace with our loss this is not to say we all dont feel pain but we can enjoy him now for what he was a truly special person and friend
13599 the loyalty and dedication of many of these friends of dan brings a tear to my eye every time i think of it
13600 people sleeping in their cars and driving and flying from around north america to be here each year is inspiring hockey players willingly paying hundreds of dollars to play in an event they would normally be paid to appear at its through that type of dedication that we surpassed our financial goals and built the feeling we all felt each year at this event
13601 the tournament has been such an amazing time each year and has given me so much
13602 i know that it has given me valuable friendships for the years to come and has also taught me the importance of giving it still amazes me that even after five years there are still some great stories about dan to be told
13603 dan would make us sing the national anthem and then play
13604 he also rode his tricycle through as the zamboni to clean the ice all while making us stand on the sidelines when he did that
13605 when we were saying goodbye that night he picked me up over his shoulder and swung me around
13606 i thought for sure he was going to drop me but he didnt let me go
13607 you would know he was proud of his family and community
13608 he really was proud of his town his family and all his friends in elmira and everyone as we all have seen was proud of him
13609 i guess for all the people who continued to show up year after year all we can say is thank you
13610 the support we have received for our new rec facility is huge but it pales in comparison to the support and strength they have given our family over the last five years
13611 really really really now hollywood stars are lecturing the decision and policymaking bodies of the world thats hot
13612 i like the prospect size and strength of our wings and the size and strength of our defense
13613 we have some guys with mobility in the long view
13614 essentially we had a real void at center and im not uncomfortable with what we were able to do at the draft with two or three guys that are complete players
13615 patrice is at his best when he is using his speed and playing an aggressive game
13616 he is a hard worker and is hard to knock off of the puck at this point in his development he projects to be a third line type checker hes the type of player who likes to play in traffic and likes to drive to the net
13617 i think their defensive style fits my style of play
13618 i kind of play the same way as the whole team plays
13619 i think nicklas needs to be productive at what hes good at
13620 hes got a good shot and a good nose for the net but you cant just be promise to have it its got to show itself
13621 when he gets the puck on the wall get it to the center and then get open
13622 hes very promising strong skilled courageous hes got unique dimensions of skill that wed really like to see how they manifest themselves here im excited about his prospects wed like to see him here sooner rather than later
13623 he plays for a team in the town he grew up and that means a lot
13624 his logic isnt misplaced but the practicality of it is its the choice hes making we want to respect that but the door is open please come he can make himself a nice career and do it sooner rather than later but he has to feel that way
13625 i think hes improved every year as far as application of that talent
13626 i think he needs to get stronger grow into his body
13627 nice shot nice release hes got some enthusiasm i expect him to not have a good year but to have a great year
13628 hes got strength and maturity nothing wrong with his game hes a productive goal scorer great penalty killer great speed smart hes been a very good pick for us
13629 hes got strength and maturity nothing wrong with his game hes a productive goal scorer great penalty killer great speed smart hes been a very good pick for us
13630 he thinks hes 6 2 and thats all that matters hes a dynamic person and a dynamic player hes fearless and gifted
13631 hes a gritty tough kid mobile good defensively one on one good feet
13632 hes going to play against the best players in the nhl its a question of experience theres no hurry theres a lot of urgency for him to push himself to be better every day its just get better so that hes ready to be there 15 years
13633 but its better than to have to tone them down then fire them up
13634 he had a better sophomore year than he thinks his expectations might not be in the right order i think he could have a really nice career hes 6 4 and mobile like he is
13635 hes not an overly big defenseman but he has really good mobility and a good shot from the point
13636 he jumps up into the rush well but needs to improve on his defensive reliability he played in a really small rink this year and was still able to move the puck quickly and well puck skill wise hes good and as he moves up his decision making will improve
13637 he plays a steady game and when he is able to simplify his game and stay within his realm he is reliable on the point
13638 hes not an overly physical defenseman he moves the puck well and doesnt panic under pressure in order to improve his game he needs to make quicker decisions with the puck
13639 weve drafted goalies in the past and their developmental process has maybe been partially impeded psychologically if not realistically by the fact that we have marty
13640 jeff signed and hes made a really serious commitment physically
13641 its about confidence i have a lot of faith in him
13642 latest street album from bailey just listen he will be throwing up a few songs on his myspace page this friday the 6th the c d features singles
13643 no u s corporation ever made that much in a quarter
13644 but while big oil is making record profits you are paying record prices at the pump and our economy is leaving working people behind
13645 4 billion each year to the oil companies including 1 2 billion for exxon mobil alone
13646 pad oil company profits and save you at best half a tank of gas
13647 all those negative ads hes running wont do a thing to lower your gas prices or lift up the debate in this country
13648 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
13649 i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can do is that what this election is really all about is that worthy of the
13650 has failed the american people on energy and that failure has led directly to our current crisis
13651 thats how america is going to free itself from our dependence on foreign oil not through short term gimmicks but through a real long term commitment to transform our energy sector
13652 im not interested in getting into a tit for tat thats not going to lower your gas prices

13656 i look forward to working harmoniously with the new board of yahoo
13657 this has been a month of encouraging news from iraq violence is down to its lowest levels since the spring of 2004 and were now in our third consecutive month with reduced violence levels holding steady
13658 significant reason for this sustained progress is the success of the surge another is the increasing capability of the iraqi forces
13659 the progress in iraq has allowed us to continue our policy of return on success we now have brought home all five of the combat brigades and the three marine units that were sent to iraq as part of the surge
13660 the last of these surge brigades returned home this month and later this year general david petraeus will present me his recommendations on future troop levels including further reductions in our combat forces as conditions permit
13661 caution that the progress is still reversible but they report that there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made
13662 were also making progress in our discussion with prime minister malikis government on a strategic framework agreement
13663 taking the lead in combat operations against terrorists and extremists
13664 this week the iraqi government is launching a new offensive in parts of diyala province that contain some of few remaining safe havens in the country
13665 this operation is iraqi led our forces are playing a supporting role
13666 the iraqi council of representatives has passed several major pieces of legislation this year and iraqi leaders are preparing for provincial elections
13667 if you could reduce these sensational attacks further i think you are almost approaching a level of normal or latent violence
13668 the fact that the levels of violence have come down so significantly and stayed down now for some two and a half months indicates there is a degree of durability
13669 be prepared to gain the world and sell your soul
13670 rehabilitation is crucial to living a full life following an injury
13671 i applaud all of the veterans participating as they strive to achieve their goals during this week of athletic competition
13672 its amazing to see how much they put into this and how much heart they have in it
13673 its really inspiring to see how motivated they are to come and win these and then to see the big smiles when they wear those medals
13674 and theyre rehabilitation at its best for our paralyzed veterans
13675 its a real morale boost for them to come here and get challenges personally outside the hospital setting
13676 bring back their competitive streak and show them that they are able to return to what they used to do in a competitive way
13677 it makes you really want to provide for them because of all that they have done for us
13678 to accomplish all these events we are forced to live together work together train together and this combined approach in my view has provided an opportunity to learn about different cultures and also to promote understanding and cooperation between our forces
13679 what i kind of consider the golden nugget in all of this
13680 is a fully digital command post exercise that we conducted to train the 4th brigade commander and his staff on the procedures they will employ in iraq

13689 the practical issues included world poverty the wars in iraq and afghanistan the situation in palestine and israel the danger of further wars and the freedom of religion

13694 he stayed strong stayed extra long til they let all the other boys out now weve got a real man with an american plan were going to put him in the big white house
13695 i wanted to offer him something that he didnt have a rally song one that really captures that maverick spirit
13696 he was physically tortured for years and yet he gets out of bed every day and serves our country for decades
13697 the entire world is looking for a way to sucker punch us

13702 we are going to make a big big difference in the american marketplace
13703 we are ensuring that the products that come into america are safe for consumers and that the regulating agencies have what they need to do their job
13704 toxic chemicals like lead and phthalates have no business in our childrens toys
13705 safety testing and certification for such hazards as powerful magnets before products are sold a ban on lead and phthalates and more will helpfully put an end to the recalls of childrens products and the horror stories that lead to those recalls

13707 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
13708 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
13709 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
13710 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
13711 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
13712 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
13713 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
13714 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
13715 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
13716 i respect and admire sen obama we just have stark differences
13717 campaigns are tough but im proud of the campaign we have run
13718 im proud of the issues we have tried to address with the american people all i can say is we are proud of that commercial
13719 we can most assuredly tell you that voters around the country do not think theres anything substantive about this latest ad do not think its something that john mccain should be proud of
13720 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
13721 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
13722 there was no significant loss of life in those towers not a one

13727 there was no significant loss of life in those towers

13729 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
13730 its been very successful and mars had proven itself to be very interesting mechanically the spacecraft is operating great and theres plenty of power margin to carry us beyond the waning summer
13731 with that what id like to do is announce that were going to extend the mission to go till the end of the fiscal year september 30
13732 were looking to understand the history of the ice by trying to figure out if this ice has ever melted and through melting has created a liquid environment that modifies soil
13733 were just getting the data back through this we also hope to resolve questions is this a habitable zone on mars meaning that we have periodic liquid water materials that are the basic ingredients for lifeforms
13734 this is a mystery this is a typically acidic environment perhaps this had to do with a nearby crater
13735 the issue was that they had inflated prices for drugs that were purchased by the state and federal medicaid programs
13736 beyond the mystery secret stories the truth behind the fiction
13737 five diverse authors tell all sharing true stories that brought their scenes to life covering everything from social issues to recent events whether to use a novel as a soapbox and revelations of embarrassing moments this will be a fast funny and insightful discussion of what lies beyond the mystery
13738 2 million will go a long way to help care for people who rely on medicaid

13755 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
13756 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
13757 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
13758 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
13759 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
13760 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
13761 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
13762 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
13763 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
13764 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
13765 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
13766 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
13767 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
13768 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
13769 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
13770 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
13771 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
13772 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
13773 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
13774 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
13775 we are thrilled that orbitalpay has chosen to support asacp as a corporate sponsor
13776 orbitalpay works diligently to provide a secure method for merchants to safely do online transactions their support of asacp will help us to provide parents a safe way for their children to surf the internet
13777 in todays society it is an irresponsible use of the internet that children of any age can access or participate in online adult entertainment we must ban together to protect the young and innocent
13778 in no way am i suggesting a limitation of consenting adults rights under the first amendment of the constitution of the united states which is why rta works so well as it allows the industry to label and leaves the responsibility to the parents where it should be however as a member of this outstanding organization we will do our part to protect all children

13782 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
13783 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
13784 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
13785 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
13786 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
13787 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
13788 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
13789 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
13790 on the design specific aspects of the application who our vendor is can make a lot of difference as to what technology we use for the design
13791 so when we didnt have the final vendor we werent able to answer the questions to either ours or the nrcs level that we wanted to answer those questions so we asked them to hold up on the review of the design specific parts of the application
13792 they did about 30 000 man hours of due diligence with toshiba to determine their abilities and as they did this due diligence they determined that not only are they capable of building the units to the standards that we expect but they are exceptionally able to build them to the highest standards
13793 toshiba has been lead contractor on two of the units built in japan and subcontractor on a third one

13801 this is a great opportunity for water executives and managers to not only interact with their local peers but also explore how they can use gis for their daily decisions and long range planning

13807 i took out two canadians maybe the people will start to hate me now
13808 in those two matches the crowd was obviously against me
13809 playing a canadian in front of a home crowd its not too easy to be in this kind of atmosphere im pleased how i handled the whole situation
13810 steve and i have had a great working relationship for many years and a great deal of respect for one another so this was a real easy decision
13811 this comes about in some respects as a mandate from new ownership in daryl katz who wanted to allow us that latitude to strengthen the management group and in my estimation i feel steve is the strongest candidate for the position
13812 kevin and steve will still bring ideas to me and well work collectively on trades draft picks player buyouts or whatever the case may be the metamorphosis of a trade is a long process and usually takes months of working diligently before a final decision is made it will be much easier making these major decisions collectively with our new management group in the end ill have the final say
13813 its a complicated business now and the new collective bargaining agreement is a large reason for that
13814 we aspire to be great and itll take many bodies to do that we feel weve assembled a managerial group that can get that done steve will do more of the day to day stuff as gm which was beginning to wear on me in some respects
13815 kevin and i have had great experience working for team canada with wayne gretzky and pat quinn
13816 we experienced tough situations and hard decisions and in times like that you really get to know people pretty well i knew if something became available where i might be able to join kevin it would be an easy decision for me and my family daryl katz expressed to me his plans for the hockey club and the city of edmonton moving forward big things are coming here and im thrilled to be a part of it
13817 i worked with some outstanding people in vancouver but i knew i would have to leave one day
13818 but i wasnt going to leave just to be a gm anywhere it had to be the right gm position and i feel this was that position
13819 id be lying if i said thats not the model any team strives for since theyve been the most successful at it in recent years
13820 detroit is a great example of how a collaborative effort can be successful the thing that most impresses me about the wings is the camaraderie within that group its really wonderful to see
13821 the last time i managed team canada ken holland was with me in the front office
13822 i listened to ken as i will listen to kevin in edmonton they both have ideas on how they want to win and decisions like that are made only by strong hockey people and im confident we can do that here but ken would be the first to tell you that despite his position he cannot do it alone he allows nill and his amateur and pro coaching staff to offer insight and input thats how kevin myself and kevin prendergast intend to do things
13823 im a believer in the saying the proof is in the pudding because everyone wants results
13824 ive always felt you cant admit too much in public and that it didnt really matter anyway because you still have to go out and win hockey games steve is a quality individual with an incredible pedigree and on top of that a real gentleman the fans will appreciate and respect him in time because while he does come across with a calm demeanor he has always had a fierce competitiveness that ive witnessed on many occasions while working with him on an international level
13825 i chose film as a major for the sole reason that i would one day become a film prof if getting to that goal takes longer than expected i will use my free time to finding interpretation work but dont expect me to stick with it as i have been informed several times that there are little to no payment positions for asl interpreters
13826 when i went to detroit as the coach 15 years ago the team was really on the upswing
13827 looking at whats here for me and for the hawks its a challenge again i would say the biggest reason is to work with my son it doesnt happen often in sports but it is happening here its certainly an exciting day for myself and for the family
13828 when i first started it was in the back of my mind but i kind of set it aside i wanted to get my career in motion over the last nine months here theres been a lot of changes everybody here senses a different atmosphere our team performed better that idea i had a long time ago kind of popped into my head again its a great day for everybody
13829 its always a tough decision when you leave an organization like detroit
13830 they understand the situation its an opportunity to come to chicago and be with stan the hawks think so much of him and so do i this is an exciting time for our family the timing could not be any better than it is today im thankful this came along at the right time im really looking forward to getting this thing to where it should be its really on its way
13831 i wont need those european glasses that director of pro scouting marc bergevin got me ill confide with him on a daily basis were going to lean on him heavily in every aspect of the game to get better hes going to help us get where we need to go
13832 he had a good camp last year but he weighed 181 pounds and was a little bit high in body fat
13833 he comes in here this year and hes 202 pounds and hes dropped some body fat to put on 21 pounds and drop body fat in a year shows he made that commitment
13834 the main training camp is pretty far away i am working harder than i ever did and well see if im going to be successful
13835 i cant say if i am ready right now because i have two more months here with barry brennan
13836 my big weakness was i wasnt too heavy i was 190 and i wasnt too strong right now im 206 and i feel pretty strong they didnt talk to me about weight but i think they want me at 210 and im going to try to be around that
13837 hes put on some good weight and that will help him this fall when he comes back to camp he needed strength and hes going to need even more to play 82 games in the nhl
13838 the ice is tight here not as big as it is in europe so its an advantage for me
13839 i dont know why but when i was younger i always liked playing on the boards it doesnt mean i dont want to skate but i just like it on the boards its good for me and i hope i can take that style to the nhl
13840 hes a real real smart player and he sees the ice so well
13841 hes more of a playmaker than a scorer thats his game he likes to set other players up he plays the point on the power play and controls the flow of the game from back there
13842 hes a real real smart player and he sees the ice so well hes more of a playmaker than a scorer thats his game
13843 hes never going to lose his instinct to be the playmaker he is but you cant be predictable right
13844 you have to give them something else to think about hes got to shoot more
13845 i think he can be a really special player in the league for a long long time
13846 we both love her dearly and have only her bests interest and well beings in our hearts
13847 although many things have changes you will always be reighs father and i will always be reighs mother
13848 reigh honey i love and miss you so much remember youre always a princess
13849 we have been unable to confirm that at this time
13850 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour
13851 wait a minute pastor rick are you saying that god gives up on us
13852 i will always love him and if he ever desires to i will reestablish a relationship with him but i will no longer pursue the pain is too great
13853 okay just do what you want i remove my hand from the situation
13854 this was not in my mind at first but i applied for a job with hockey canada in 2004 and when i had a look at this program i felt that if i was going to go into it my goal would be to coach this team one day
13855 its about goals you set for yourself once i started in the program i had a goal to coach this team one day im here now its a great opportunity for me when youre coaching a program like this great responsibility comes with it its something im looking forward to
13856 im going to pay more attention this year for sure
13857 it will be good for us to keep the evaluation going
13858 youve got to have a system in place that you and the staff feel very confident with
13859 a really tight system but as soon as you get the puck you have to go on offense
13860 to play for him you have to show up every day and have a great work ethic the right attitude
13861 everyone has to buy into what youre trying to do if not because of the way things happen in a tournament like that disaster can hit fairly quickly
13862 there are so many people taking care of so many things that the only thing we have to do is coach
13863 were treated first class you cant ask for a better environment to work
13864 i was 9 years old and he was coaching and i am 40 years old and hes still coaching
13865 ive been going to their games for a while hey darren pang was in the net so its been a long time
13866 this time i wasnt going to let the opportunity pass me by
13867 to be a part of an organization like detroit who couldnt be happy with that
13868 learn how to communicate with people that dont speak english you have to find a way to teach them the game and you learn the european game they are a very hard working group that want to learn want to improve so it was a perfect fit for me
13869 to me this is my last chance to make it in the nhl
13870 thats the organization i want to go to they are a skilled team i fit their mold for me to give it one last chance with their organization is something im willing to try i didnt want to look back in 10 years and wonder what would have happened if i gave it one more year
13871 do i think im going to make the team out of camp
13872 i dont think so whoever plays the best thats who gets called up thats why im willing to take a chance with them i dont let it affect my game when i get sent to the minors thats something ive been able to deal with because ive dealt with it so many years in a row
13873 its definitely nice to have someone to go with it seemed like it could be pretty adventurous
13874 we werent getting the contracts we were hoping for its my hope i can go over there and prove myself and get back in the nhl
13875 but you wish you could play more which makes it bittersweet
13876 obviously i had a dream of playing in the nhl when the opportunity to play for the rangers came along i felt it was the best place for me if we would not have won in chicago i would have left with the sense there was some unfinished work its always easier to leave when you go out on a win
13877 we have many things in the back of our mind right now but its pretty early to talk about it because there are so many question marks of who is going to stay in the nhl and who is going to be back
13878 its no secret for anybody that guys like luke schenn john tavares and those guys have a good shot at making our team they were on the team last year so obviously they have a good shot but were not going to go further because there are too many question marks
13879 the main goal was to get to know them better especially on the ice and we feel we reached that goal here
13880 i have a much better idea of who is nazem kadri and travis hamonic and those guys its good for us to have a clear idea of who they are and how they play
13881 were going to put together another list of people that we want to invite to the next camp and a list of people that we feel that maybe are not ready to get invited to the camp
13882 its not going to be done right away because we have to assemble our ideas and put our thoughts together this is only the first step the next one is to evaluate them in their season thats an important step of the process
13883 camp will be at the beginning of december so it will be done by the end of november for sure it takes time you have to think about it and were going to have to talk amongst the staff to get our things in order
13884 ill be antsy about it because you dont know what to expect but you have played your best
13885 im sure everyone expects it to be a friendly scrimmage but you have the top 44 players in canada here competing hard to win a spot so you cant help but mix it up a little bit
13886 its healthy on ice its all business you make friends off the ice no harm no foul there is nothing personal out there
13887 everyone is battling hard and wanted this win to find out which team was better
13888 oh yeah that means a lot we would have felt depressed if we lost the game were going back to the hotel with smiles on our faces
13889 i feel ive trained hard and done the right things so hopefully reaching the nhl will become a reality this year
13890 if not ill spend another year of junior i want to make the team thats my goal i cant see a better way to develop than playing in the nhl this is not an easy team to make but im going to come to training camp and try my best
13891 being drafted was one highlight of my career and something very special but coming to training camp last year was also great and to have a chance to play world juniors was amazing
13892 dad coached me in junior and it was nice to have him behind the bench with me for the super series it was a good experience in terms of having him as a coach as compared to a parent at home its obviously two different stories at the rink its business and its intense but i kind of knew that and expected that i think he was a great coach and mentor for me when i was 16 17 years old
13893 it was awesome he was traded to red deer from kootenay a couple of years ago and we had a lot of fun together
13894 when we were little we always hoped to have an opportunity to play together and we did so that was something now our goal is to reach the nhl as soon as we can i know he has already spent a full year in the ahl with quad city and got a taste to what its like
13895 my family has helped me with a lot of things growing up and i try to use that to my advantage
13896 i want to make the team thats my goal i cant see a better way to develop than playing in the nhl this is not an easy team to make but im going to come to training camp and try my best
13897 i felt it was important to shut him down a little bit and give him a rest
13898 we eased up on the cardio training and prepared a diet for him to assist in his getting stronger and adding more weight
13899 hes a kid from great bloodlines and he thinks the game extremely well
13900 were confident he can take that next step to the nhl
13901 hes around quite a bit whenever im in raleigh and hes always skating and helping out
13902 hes so smart and knows so much about the game he has such a good mental focus and in terms of advice he has offered me quite a bit of everything its great to know that a player with the credentials of ron francis is always available
13903 its a good group of veterans that are back for camp and we are looking to those players in lake placid to push the pace lead and be at the front of things in terms of what we want in pace and tempo
13904 i think all of those players were on last years team for a reason
13905 they have a lot of character work hard and have persistence in terms of the challenges we are going to have at camp im sure they will have that mindset that they want to have a great team so im sure they will be pushing the pace
13906 we have a slightly different format this year where we are going to bring three american teams up to lake placid and have some kind of intra squad stuff going on earlier than we normally have in the past
13907 well get to games right away and get to evaluating the kids
13908 i think were getting more players involved in the camp and getting more guys experience
13909 this year were bringing in some younger players into the camp we have some 91s attending five of them some younger kids we think are going to be future players for us and we want to get them involved and see how they do in the camp
13910 it allows more players to have the experience and really gives us the opportunity to look at a wider variety of players theres a lot of players that we may not have a lot of information on that we would like to see at that level
13911 i started working as an nhl reporter back in vancouver and i was lucky to grab a chance to work as an analyst for sbs sports
13912 hockey is not as popular here as it could be but the sport has a lot of potential to appeal to koreans right now though soccer basketball baseball and even volleyball are hot here im basically by myself in korea trying to spread word of the coolest game on earth its not easy
13913 the asia league in general and anyang halla in particular has an opportunity to continue to grow and develop
13914 the chinese component of the league will still take some time but the continued involvement of the
13915 you really want to try to evaluate these kids as quickly as possible to figure out the kind of player they are and the style they bring
13916 what are their strengths their weaknesses and if theres an area that you feel they could improve you can try and explain that to them and work with them to sure things up
13917 the biggest thing with a lot of these kids is that theyre just too young and they need time to mature grow into their bodies and get stronger
13918 while that process is taking place you want to work their game a little bit as well
13919 brandon has played a ton of hockey the last few years and we felt it was important for us to shut him down a bit and give him some rest
13920 weve helped him out with his cardio and diet to help him get stronger and put a little more weight on that frame of his but hes a kid from great bloodlines and he things the game extremely well hes a player were very confident will be playing in the nhl someday
13921 he started off well but was the hit with injuries that hurt his progression
13922 were not sure exactly where hes at right now but hes certainly a talented kid who were hoping will rebound
13923 when you are part of a championship team thats huge to gain that experience that kind of success and understand what a championship is all about is invaluable at that age im sure hes working hard and ready to push again in september
13924 i think that confidence he had in training camp just carried over to spokane and he had a great year
13925 when you are part of a championship team thats huge to gain that experience that kind of success and understand what a championship is all about is invaluable at that age im sure hes working hard and ready to push again in september
13926 hes in a good program with good coaches and hes shown a real good skill set in addition to becoming more of a vocal leader thats something we like to see and we expect him to continue his progression
13927 he stepped in and played really well when we he was called up last season
13928 unfortunately he suffered a knee injury that ended his season but he has since had surgery and has done rehab and is back on the ice and progressing well we expect big things from casey again this coming season
13929 justin has made huge strides and its a credit to him and a credit to tommy barrasso for getting that kind of play out of him
13930 we do expect him to take that next step and be with albany in the ahl and continue to make progress toward the nhl
13931 i think its really close but the fans are kind of getting antsy
13932 they want to see us make the playoffs and we want to make the playoffs we have to start showing up with results
13933 he got his feet wet but he wasnt strong enough
13934 the injury set him back so we decided to put him back in syracuse for the rest of the year and he was really good in syracuse in february march and april he had a good playoffs
13935 hes another young player that sees the ice real well and he plays a position were really weak at
13936 hes going make a push to play for us this year
13937 hes a dynamic offensive player with a high skill level and great passion for the game
13938 you can see that how he plays he has excelled in the last two or three years in all the international competitions against older players we hope hes going to be a real good offensive player in the nhl
13939 tommy is a big strong man and hes just figuring out what he needs to do to be a pro both mentally and physically
13940 he spent the year in syracuse and hes one of the ones in columbus that got in there early this summer and is committed to training hard jared boll did it last year and that gave him great results tommy is a very good prospect
13941 once we get him acclimated he has a pretty good skill set and is a great skater with great size
13942 he was very highly rated at the draft last year and he fell because of the russian factor
13943 hes 6 2 now and 202 pounds so hes put on some good weight and that will help him this fall when he comes to camp he needed strength and hes going to need even more to play 82 games in the nhl
13944 i think hes got to go down to syracuse and earn his stripes down there
13945 he has to be the type of player that he was in junior you never say never but he is a feisty player a competitive kid that brings a lot of energy every night and he has good skill he can really shoot puck and he has a great release
13946 he came in here for just the first couple of days of development camp and he was first in the fitness testing this is a kid that understands the commitment that you have to have to get to the next step these are the kids that find a way to win and find a way to play in the nhl i am really excited about him
13947 i can see him getting nhl games next year but we want him to play a lot
13948 whether its in columbus or syracuse hes going to play a lot goalies traditionally take longer so it wouldnt hurt him if he played in syracuse but some people are special athletes and im not going to say no to anything at this point
13949 barack knows what it means to be a black man living in a country and a culture that is controlled by rich white people hillary hillary aint never been called a nigger hillary has never had her people defined as a non person
13950 suffering is the single greatest challenge to the christian faith
13951 will provide the 20 of functionality that is used 80 of the time
13952 youre not going to keep a 19 year old boy on your team if hes not a top player
13953 he doesnt want to play junior hockey quite honestly im fine with that hes an elite player in his age group hes going to play with men and hes probably better served i wish hed play more games
13954 we are very excited to get the caliber of player that fabian is under contract for the next two seasons
13955 he is a very good prospect and will definitely be a nice addition to our group of younger players
13956 hes got a huge skill set hes fast and hes got top two line potential without question were thrilled with that
13957 weve seen robin grow and develop into one of our top prospects over the past two seasons
13958 hell spend a season in the swedish elite league which is one of the top hockey leagues in the world and as an organization were very comfortable with that his development will only grow while playing with djurgardens
13959 hes a physical defensive defenseman he can play in our top six next season
13960 jesse is a skilled winger with great size and versatility
13961 he is a high character person and has always shown a commitment to better himself as a player both on and off the ice he skates well straight ahead generating good speed and complementing his skill level to be very dangerous on the rush and in the offensive zone
13962 we feel that he has a good future and hes part of the way we want to go
13963 very definitely he will be in the nhl based on his level of play to date
13964 hes coming over now to adapt to north america the rinks a different size in europe the bigger ice and the angles are different so hes going to have to get used to the angles the changes in the way shooters shoot over here theres a lot more shots over here
13965 per ledin will add a different dimension to our team
13966 we believe his gritty style of play will benefit our club in the upcoming 2008 09 season
13967 antti is one of the top european goaltenders and had been courted by the majority of nhl teams
13968 we like his size athleticism ability and the depth that this gives us at this position were thrilled to add a young talent like niemi to our stable of prospects
13969 pesonen is a quick skilled player that has had much success in the finnish elite league
13970 we look forward to watching him perform at his first nhl training camp
13971 felix is a great competitor who plays at a high skill level
13972 his experience in both the qmjhl and german elite league last season has rounded his game perfectly for the professional level
13973 anything less than 30 goals from malone and radim vrbata would be a disappointment

14051 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed
14052 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
14053 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
14054 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us
14055 all very calmly he was wearing sunglasses it was no big deal to him
14056 the guy came to the front of the door with buddys head in his hands decapitated he dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
14057 we want to make sure the process is followed as aggressively as possible the full legal process
14058 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare certainly the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history

14060 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
14061 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
14062 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this blood curdling scream
14063 but i have been especially impressed this week with the comfortable candor with which muslims and christians have clearly stated their own doctrines to one another

14066 we are just trying to find common ground for religions to work together as intended by god
14067 the intention behind the common word is not to foist the theology of one religion upon another or to attempt conversion
14068 just as we promise to seek to move beyond the stereotyping of muslims found in the media can i ask you my muslim friends to get to know us beyond what is reported in the newspapers and television programs

14116 but i have been especially impressed this week with the comfortable candour with which muslims and christians have clearly stated their own doctrines to one another
14117 it has been good to sit together and build new friendships
14118 in this dialogue we are not discussing doctrines or creeds
14119 we are just trying to find common ground for religions to work together as intended by god
14120 the intention behind the common word is not to foist the theology of one religion upon another or to attempt conversion
14121 these children will benefit from the gift of camp it is a small gesture with a potentially huge impact on these children and their families they are in pain and they too must endure the pain very often without the opportunity to have time for themselves to grieve to heal or some time to just be a child and have some fun

14129 we believe this bill will help stabilize the housing market and create renewed confidence in the broader economy
14130 we are particularly optimistic about the bills 7 500 tax credit for first time home buyers this provision has the potential to create much needed demand among first time buyers who have been undecided about buying a new home and if first time buyers enter the market then existing homeowners may trade up creating an upward spiral of demand
14131 we reached out to yorktown with hopes of resolving the issues that led to this but the mall has remained firm were deeply sorry to all who will be inconvenienced by this change
14132 were grateful to the village of downers grove for their willingness to work with us on such short notice
14133 operating service to this location would have been difficult and potentially unsafe
14134 we could not go along with the alternate location that yorktown recommended
14135 we realize that a large number of shoppers employees and passengers connecting to other routes enjoyed having service to yorktown center
14136 the malls management has made its choice and left us with no viable alternative to continue service to the mall

14142 sas is the best one stop bi shop that includes high end analytics from a single vendor
14143 we see no reason sas cant continue on its amazing track record of uninterrupted 32 year growth
14144 even though several other vendors realize or are starting to realize the value of providing higher end analytics tools like statistical analysis and predictive modeling sas is pretty hard to beat in this category especially when it comes to embedding such analytical routines in powerful dbms engines like teradata
14145 using sas r enterprise bi server brooks brothers has been able to turn data into an increasingly strategic corporate asset
14146 we are now able to focus on the performance indicators that matter most and proactively determine what actions will yield the most favorable results we use our data to power better business decisions

14176 shareholders of euniverse laud the federal judge in jim brown v brett c brewers decision to order the stockholder class action lawsuit arising from myspaces unfair sale in september 2005 to news corp to proceed to trial
14177 in light of our findings and conclusions on plaintiffs allegations concerning the value of myspace the internal management projections and the derivative suits we need not consider the remaining allegations of the csac concerning the purported interest from viacom and the myspace option we intimate no opinion as to the merits of these latter allegations at this time
14178 in light of our conclusion that count two is adequately pled we cannot find untainted stockholder approval of the merger here
14179 it has been three years since i worked around the clock pleading with other myspace intermix shareholders to vote against the sale of myspace to news corporation in 2005 i knew that the value of the company was billions of dollars however the deceptive practice of hiding myspace financials by intermix management robbed shareholders of their opportunity to adequately gauge the companys value
14180 this is a very simple case management of public companies have been sent a signal today that there are certain conditions that legally must be met prior to the sale of a publicly traded company
14181 as we aim to enlarge our business footprint nationally its imperative that we continue to fortify our sales team with experienced knowledgeable professionals
14182 gregg chris and dot bring a diverse set of skills to champion and were confident that their addition will help us continue to thrive
14183 this study highlights the costs of poor succession planning by boards and senior executives when companies dont have a solid pool of internal candidates they often pay extra to new executives by offering signing bonuses large initial equity grants and make whole payments
14184 we are excited about our expansion into the minnesota market because we know that busy health conscious shoppers in this area are looking for delicious easy meal ideas
14185 we create meals based on what we put in not what we leave out
14186 our organic and natural ingredients are key to the superior health and taste aspects of organic bistro meals
14187 when the tides of life turn against you and the current upsets your boat dont waste those tears on what might have been just lie on your back and float
14188 i think god is testing the patience of my relatives
14189 of course hes naked hes a baby when youre a baby is the only time you can walk around nude and no one cares you gotta live it up
14190 among the many papers which dumbledore left in his will to the hogwarts archives
14191 beedle was somewhat out of step with his times in preaching a message of brotherly love for muggles
14192 many of us wizards first discovered that magic could not bring back the dead
14193 much of it is dependent on how much water they can continue to take out of the hillside because it is the water pressure building up and creating the subsidence
14194 i think i have significant amounts that i need to see
14195 fervent defense of freedom of expression and more generally of individual and collective freedoms
14196 people mostly say their government should not take sides in the israeli palestinian conflict just three countries favour taking the palestinian side egypt iran and turkey and one is divided india no country favours taking israels side including the united states where 71 per cent favour taking neither side
14197 there is a wide horizon to expand bilateral relations and even to forge a strategic alliance between iraq and egypt
14198 we hope that this visit will be a step in that direction
14199 we are fully ready to provide security and a location or anything that will facilitate the presence of an egyptian ambassador in iraq to enhance bilateral relations
14200 iran is a friendly nation like turkey for example but the arab countries are the lung through which we breathe air we want to build relations with all and we do not want to be a party to policies of axes in the region
14201 we believe that policies of isolation and regional axes are useless iraq can no longer be the arab worlds eastern gate as it was addressed once iraq can be an arab bridge for a strategic regional partnership in such a framework we can realise the interests of all parties and each can then have his role in accordance to his size and in way that does not infringe on others interests
14202 we differentiate between two things shiism which is only an interpretation of islam and dedication to the family of the prophet mohamed and any political project
14203 is only a religious sect and not a political party and it is wrong to associate all the arab shias with one political project or a specific political agenda
14204 arab shias are sons of their own countries and like sunnis they should maintain their local identity
14205 on the other hand its harmful to raise doubts about the arab shias loyalty to their countries and to accuse them of harbouring a foreign agenda
14206 shias are citizens of their own countries and they are governed by their national specificity
14207 we are emotional people and all these ads play on that nerve sometimes they go the extra mile of using a quranic verse
14208 my appearance is the most important thing in my life
14209 the patients i examined used creams that allegedly treat hair loss they did not witness any progress though there was no harm done
14210 we dont have to wait till the damage is done
14211 the medicine was neither registered in the ministry of health nor sold in the pharmacies so we closed his facility
14212 the consumer must be aware before using any medicine and the media should refrain from advertising any bogus products regardless of the profit
14213 they should help increase the awareness of the consumer rather than opening the door for frauds
14214 most of the influence occurs among low income social classes well off and highly educated people go to famous doctors and buy expensive products
14215 we cant take action unless a complaint is filed by the consumer
14216 in that case she took us to the beauty centre and we took the owner to the prosecutor generals office
14217 people escape conventional medicine because they believe that these phony medicines have no side effects because the advertiser claims it is 100 per cent herbal
14218 patients with chronic diseases are hopeless and are eager for anything with a radical effect
14219 in the rural parts of egypt many people tend to rely on these kinds of so called medicines
14220 these things are serious because they use hormones and since the bottle usually doesnt have a leaflet we dont know the sources or the ingredients
14221 nearly 300 000 were poured down the drains following a decision that violates egypts hotel rules
14222 alcohol is no longer available at the hotels restaurants or in the mini refrigerators in rooms we have been negotiating for three weeks and have reached an agreement under which we will serve alcohol at a bar on the 40th floor talks will continue in the hope of securing a better arrangement
14223 his decision to stop selling alcohol at the hotel was based on his belief it will make the hotel more suitable for families
14224 its not a bad idea but i dont think there is a market for it in egypt
14225 negotiations between the owner and the operating company started immediately after the announcement and everything was settled between both parties without our intervention
14226 the loss has been huge especially during the weeks of negotiation
14227 none of the profits or expenses will be included in the owners profits
14228 we simply cannot afford to remove alcohol from egypts hotels its one of the things that draws visitors and banning it would put millions of egyptians out of work
14229 will encourage a large number of political reformists to join hands with the documents makers
14230 every egyptian has the right to participate in tracing the future of his country
14231 seminars and public rallies will also be organised by the document makers to present it to the public
14232 i dont think that the issues surrounding political reform are that interesting to ordinary people whose main concern is how to provide for their daily needs
14233 having expected ismail to be convicted we were deeply shocked when the court acquitted him
14234 it is the cosy relationship between businessmen and politicians that breeds the culture of corruption the price of which is paid by poor egyptians
14235 the evidence presented by the office was not strong enough to convict ismail
14236 the evidence that ismail was largely to blame for failing to save the victims of the ill fated ferry was inconclusive
14237 this clears them of any blame for delays in informing rescue authorities about the accident
14238 ismail is not the owner of the rescue vessels al salam knight and eleanora and as a result was not in a position to order them to participate in the rescue operations
14239 post mortem examinations did not reveal the time of death or show that there was a delay in rescue operations
14240 a black comedy when critics and opponents of the government face trial before military courts while wealthy ndp members such as mamdouh ismail are allowed to flee the country and then return to hire a bevy of lawyers to defend them
14241 the charges brought were ill judged and the prosecution ignored many of the details provided by the parliamentary fact finding report they opted not to mention the fact that ismails company systematically violated safety measures and that the ferry in order to increase company profits was carrying more passengers than allowed by the maritime authorities
14242 pernicious effects of the close ties between the ndp and big business
14243 is willing to break free from the iranians as soon as it gets what it wants the alliance between damascus and tehran can change if peace is achieved with israel
14244 if the region heads towards peace other side issues can be tackled as well
14245 to weaken the existing alliance between the two countries and replace it with normal relations
14246 they were generally polite with me but one officer briefly questioned me about articles i write which he considered strongly worded
14247 authorise independent nationalist palestinian intellectuals to look into the internal palestinian crisis and try to find a solution
14248 the arrests were carried out without the governors knowledge the decision came from ramallah the governor has nothing to do with it
14249 exposed attempt to divert attention from the gaza beach bombing
14250 meaningless and not serious in light of what his security apparatuses are doing in the west bank
14251 the arrest of some fatah elements in gaza took place in the context of an investigation into a murderous crime that killed six innocent people but fatahs arrests of hamas supporters and other palestinian citizens were politically motivated and meant to serve the interests of the israeli occupation
14252 the israeli army fired light and smoke bombs into the store at 2am on tuesday turning everything in the shop to ashes
14253 if abu mazen were serious about holding a dialogue with hamas he would have ordered the arrests of its activists to be stopped and would have put an end to the security cooperation with the israeli army in pursuit of hamas leaders and its charitable institutions
14254 crisis the palestinians are going through is a national crisis that requires bringing together the efforts of all to reach solutions to the problems storming the palestinian domestic arena
14255 the referee killed us i cant believe he is registered by fifa
14256 this referee should go back to his country by bus after his awful performance today he was not focused on the game at all we had a clear penalty in the second half and we had a valid goal disallowed after that
14257 i can tell you that my contract with zamalek will only last one month if things remain the way they are we lost two games because of refereeing
14258 we played a good game and forced our own style and i think that the team will be boosted by newcomers and players returning from injury
14259 the game was tactically tough but i think that we deserved our victory
14260 i think hollman should watch the incidents again there was no penalty and the goal was offside
14261 we have a division in the council at this point
14262 it is not sudan that is demanding article 16 it is africa it is an affront to africa it is an insult to the whole continent
14263 a truck packed with central security personnel arrived and arrested 14 of the 30 demonstrators while the rest managed to flee
14264 they were beaten by plain clothes security personnel and taken to al raml police station where they were referred to the prosecution which accused them of assembling hampering traffic and attempting to topple the regime
14265 they told investigators that they did not advocate destructive ideas let alone toppling the regime they said they would not even incite people to stage a civil disobedience
14266 prisoners of conscience detained for their participation in the protest
14267 send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible urging the authorities to immediately and unconditionally release them and all other members of the 6 april youth facebook group
14268 a thorough and impartial investigation into allegations that the protesters were beaten by riot police and security forces and that state security investigations ssi agents verbally abused and threatened the protesters at the al pharana ssi office with the results made public and those responsible brought to justice
14269 these tyrannical practices adopted by the government reflect a muzzling of the right to peaceful expression
14270 the government believes that the number of cyberspace activists most of whom are not affiliated with political parties is growing steadily what really worries them is that these young activists are ordinary people who have the potential to organise a demonstration or a strike
14271 the authorities have clamped down on the 6 april activists because they are terrified of the idea that ordinary people without any political party affiliation are developing the potential to instigate political action even the phrase 6 april youth is enough to ruffle the feathers of the government the security apparatus clearly believes that this kind of opposition has the ability to incite people to demonstrate thats why they hit them hard in alexandria where they were just flying a kite with an egyptian flag attached to it
14272 continue to impose a heavy burden of bank regulation on the private sector reducing opportunities and restricting economic freedom
14273 bribery of low level civil servants seems to be a part of daily life
14274 and there are allegations of significant corruption among high level officials
14275 import restrictions service market access restrictions some high tariffs burdensome and non transparent sanitary measures cumbersome bureaucracy and non transparent regulations weak enforcement of intellectual property rights and non transparent customs administration add to the cost of trade
14276 no u s corporation ever made that much in a quarter
14277 but while big oil is making record profits you are paying record prices at the pump and our economy is leaving working people behind
14278 4 billion each year to the oil companies including 1 2 billion for exxon mobil alone
14279 pad oil company profits and save you at best half a tank of gas
14280 all those negative ads hes running wont do a thing to lower your gas prices or lift up the debate in this country
14281 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
14282 i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can do is that what this election is really all about is that worthy of the
14283 has failed the american people on energy and that failure has led directly to our current crisis
14284 thats how america is going to free itself from our dependence on foreign oil not through short term gimmicks but through a real long term commitment to transform our energy sector
14285 im not interested in getting into a tit for tat thats not going to lower your gas prices
14286 today we see new behaviour shown by the united states my question is is such behaviour rooted in a new approach in other words mutual respect cooperation and justice or is this approach a continuation in the confrontation with iranian people but in a new guise
14287 i think well get a ministerial statement that will reflect the balance of power id be surprised if its very different to the 2005 wording
14288 theyll defer serious discussion on hizbullahs weapons to a national dialogue
14289 the weapons question was finished after the july 2006 war but especially after the events of may and doha
14290 the main imperative of the march 14 people now is to save face the opposition and hizbullah are firmly in control of the agenda
14291 when hizbullah has been able to bring tangible results for what it has been campaigning for the last few years i believe it is in a position to persuade the lebanese that armed resistance has been a success
14292 they want expressions and terms that could be interpreted different ways by different parties in order to help them later
14293 hizbullah has moved on from the shebaa farms and prisoners to talking about a national defence strategy
14294 and that will take years it needs a proper army and a detailed intricate plan to integrate hizbullah fighters into the army
14295 theyve understood the need to let others save face thats why they came up with the national dialogue
14296 i think differences will re emerge soon i believe these could be long tough negotiations
14297 i am staying within 14 march but i want to remind them of arabism and palestine which is more sacred than sanctity itself
14298 we can balance between the resistance and the state as long as the final decision remains in the hands of the state
14299 he understands the us moment has weakened and the syrians are coming back
14300 im running to give people the chance for a different choice
14301 one of the huge contrasts between the republican leaders and myself
14302 is that they keep looking at economic development as uranium mining and the building of nuclear power plants i say that tourism itself is an excellent form of economic development that does not deplete your resources
14303 when the radical environmentalist organizations try to shut that down
14304 theyre taking mineral royalties that belong to us and future generations
14305 i thought the idea of the natural family resolution was fine
14306 we have one candidate who wants to utilize our natural resources to create jobs
14307 and one who thinks we can survive on a tourism based economy with service based jobs
14308 people in the old guard want to pretend we have a resource based economy they arent paying attention
14309 were in a global economy and industrial jobs no longer exist except at a subsistence level
14310 the likelihood that his home will be condemned as uninhabitable and that he will be forced to abandon it as his neighbors have is very high
14311 before we had to ship our heavy beers in warm trucks and store them in an unrefrigerated warehouse for the best taste beers should be cold
14312 until then it never occurred to anyone to extend the rule to the distillery and breweries
14313 because getting married is costly parents who have already spent much of their savings on their daughters weddings will think twice before supporting a change of mind regardless of the pain their girls are going through
14314 unless your parents support you financially and psychologically or unless you are capable of supporting yourself and your children and own your own flat dont even think of getting divorced or life can be very hard especially when there are children
14315 families need to communicate in order to stay strong but unfortunately economic instigated depressions mean that silence is getting the better of people
14316 in doing so families barely talk to each other any more and their feelings are numbed
14317 certainly husbands prefer computers to tv and in their quest to escape their economic and marital problems at least 50 per cent of them have instigated extra marital albeit virtual relationships with women over the internet
14318 this is a new strange dilemma in our society which is unacceptable ethically socially and religiously
14319 when i realised that my husband depended on my money to cover not only the expenses of the house and children but also to pay for his cigarettes and shisha i decided immediately to get divorce
14320 its better for me to save that money and invest it in my children and my own needs
14321 overall the values of society have changed mainly because wives no longer believe in the value of the family and they are incapable of shouldering the responsibilities of marriage
14322 in the past girls were brought up on values the most important value of all that they should keep in mind when getting married is that they should endure anything and everything to protect their families from collapsing because without their husbands they are weak like a bird with broken wings women should obey their husbands no matter what
14323 divorce amounts to a certificate of failure for a couple though both the husband and wife most likely believe they have exerted all the possible efforts to pass the exam it is the most important exam in life because it means the collapse of a family
14324 protestors in sulaimaniya present warrant of protest against elections law
14325 sons of iraq made iraq safer whats their mission now
14326 a situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the prosecutor by the security council acting under chapter vii of the charter of the united nations
14327 this is the first time this technology has been used to look at buried antiquities
14328 ct scan examination was used to know the reason for the mysterious death of tutankhamun as well as identifying some royal mummies such as the mummy of queen hatshepsut and the diseases they suffered from
14329 in egypt almost everything real had its counterpart meaning or significance in the spiritual world but theres a lot of debate as to whether these vessels were ever used or not
14330 can we have fish and chips instead lets try some restaurant maybe mcdonalds in porto marina
14331 well wait till you are done with your sushi and miso soup bon appetite
14332 i wanted to direct films at any price and i had to bow to some of the norms of the time thus i made four films between 1950 and 1953 starting with father amin in 1950 i wanted to begin my career with son of the nile but i was told production cost would be very high so i began with a less costly production
14333 the most important thing i achieved in son of the nile was the realistic depiction of life in the country 90 per cent of the shooting took place on location outside the studio i also presented shoukri sarhan as the face of the authentic egyptian peasant the film was a success by commercial standards production costs were le 13 000 while the film took le 70 000 at the box office
14334 no doubt the film was influenced by the climate following the 1952 revolution until then i didnt care much about politics and i was no exception in this regard to most of the egyptian filmmakers of the time who worked in isolation from what was going on in society the only difference between me and the rest was my knowledge of international cinema the blazing sun was the first film i made that took an overt political stance being a stand against feudalism though at that time it was only an instinctive position and one that sought just to praise the victim and indict the oppressor however in the film i also insisted on departing from the norms of the time that said that an innocent victim should be saved at the last moment instead i let him die for a crime he did not commit i succeeded in creating a climax for the film that made the audience leave the auditorium feeling insecure and uneasy this was something i learned to do deliberately in later films
14335 in the film i wanted to discuss social reality through a personal prism the film failed miserably on first release on the opening night one member of the audience came up to me afterwards and spat in my face you cannot imagine how it feels when you walk into an empty auditorium in which a film of yours is being shown i exerted efforts to make this film the like of which i had never made for any of my previous films my disappointment at its failure was such that for a while i returned to commercial cinema
14336 which i still believe in but my main reason for accepting saladin was to prove that it was possible to make an epic film and to stage the kind of battles seen in hollywood films on a small budget true the budget for the film reached 100 000 egyptian pounds but this was still a small amount compared to the costs of international historical films i also discovered the power of widescreen colour production through making the film and after making it i never again worked in black and white
14337 i wanted to deal with the new egypt that was in the making following the socialist decrees and the old one that was trying to subvert this socialist orientation i played the role of a member of the bourgeoisie bent on subverting the nasserist experiment for the same reasons that i took the role of the newspaper vendor qenawi in central station the characters were so intimate to my way of thinking that i felt nobody could do them like i could i went to lebanon following the making of the film for the reasons expressed by the characters in the film who represent the new egypt disappointment at how the socialism we had longed for was turning out at the hands of the bureaucrats making it into something stifling i was fed up and i decided to leave in the hope of getting a breath of fresh air the time i spent in lebanon however was a period of anxiety and a waste of energy when the june 1967 defeat struck i became convinced that i had to return to egypt and face reality however harsh it might be i was born anew after the 1967 defeat
14338 i have long stopped worrying about what is realist and what is not mohamed abu soweilim the main character in the land falling down at the end of the film while being dragged to his death by soldiers on horseback is a realist enough gesture but for him to plough the land with his bleeding fingers as he dies is not when i thought about this i realised that it didnt bother me whether the two gestures were realist or not i just went ahead and filmed them
14339 i had a contract with the state owned film production company to produce the film but then the company was dissolved in october 1971 and i had to find another source of finance i formed my own company and sought help from algeria to finance the film when it was banned i was very depressed but fortunately it was not banned for long the experience taught me that even if a film is banned for a while eventually it will be released in the case of the sparrow the fact that the film was only released after the october war rather muted its message since it was a response to the 1967 defeat
14340 i wanted to testify to tell the truth about myself and my time
14341 i am in favour of both choices of entering into dialogue and of armed resistance they are not mutually exclusive in cases where dialogue is no longer possible we have to resort to arms but if there is a possibility of dialogue i prefer it over violence what i am completely against is the failure to prepare oneself for battle and instead to indulge in empty nationalistic and religious sloganeering my choice of cafarelli as the person to engage in dialogue with was also not by accident cafarelli was an intellectual who had called for social justice and who had clashed strongly with napoleon the climax of this clash takes place at acre when napoleon talks about glory and immortality and cafarelli counters that napoleon is interested only in his place in history and the use he can make of others to achieve his ends
14342 its just me mike skinner but i also have some help

14346 the people can always be brought to the bidding of their leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same way in any country
14347 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
14348 we hope to be able to answer the question of whether this was a habitable zone on mars it will be for future missions to find if anyone is home on this environment
14349 move from looking for water to seeing whether there were habitats for life
14350 encouraging or persuading voters to vote or not to vote for one or more specified parties or one or more candidates
14351 it sounds a little bit crazy and its definitely not our intention to be campaigning in favour of one or the other
14352 the spiritual leadership of a global communion of independent and autonomous provinces should not be reduced to one man appointed by a secular government

14358 my mom was more interested in companionship money and getting her coochie wet than she was with raising me right and providing a good example to follow selfish heathen
14359 weve taken this action as a prudent response to the current extraoridnary market conditions that have resulted in higher than usual redemptions in the fund not matched by fresh investment
14360 because property is a long term investment and the assets are not immediately realisable these types of provisions are common to these types of funds to ensure that the interests of investors are protected during periods of market volatility
14361 in the current market where investors are looking to reduce their exposure to property investments we believe we are acting in the best interests of investors by temporarily suspending activity to preserve the quality of the fund
14362 she was out of her mind almost just mentally emotionally and physically drained
14363 as the average climate warms up the heat extremes will become more extreme and well have more intense more frequent and longer lasting heat waves as we progress through the 21st century
14364 its sort of been the quiet killer for many years
14365 there were a number of days where the body count kept increasing and there was absolutely nothing you could do because the heat had already taken its toll it was a helpless feeling
14366 if i couldnt go to a tap and get a drink of water i dont know what id do
14367 i dont really give it much thought actually i figure north battlefords got to have clean water bottled water just doesnt taste the same
14368 big city water in this country is absolutely fine but the problem with assuring safe potable water is that it takes a minimum degree of microbiological knowledge and engineering skill and a supporting infrastructure
14369 doing that requires you have a large enough customer base so you can afford the high quality relatively expensive services
14370 ontario is a paragon of sanity compared to british columbia where you have a third of the population and 4 000 water suppliers
14371 every small town every little place has its own jealously guarded water systems most of which have inadequate treatment
14372 the real problem with canadian drinking water quality is we have far too many rinky dink suppliers and theyre too small to produce the level of safety that our society seems to demand
14373 they can have effects on reproduction some pharmaceuticals estrogens testosterone some pesticides the endocrine system is the one that produces hormones and it is very very sensitive and there are chemicals in the water that influence the endocrine system of fish
14374 i think the reproductive effects are potentially important and we do hear about human fertility issues sperm count in males decreasing problems with learning difficulties in children allergies asthma cancers there are so many things we dont have an explanation for
14375 those systems will catch quite a few numbers of nasties like oils and very complex large chain molecules like pcbs they dont do well at all with these endocrine disruptors
14376 most pesticides and fertilizers that get into our streams and rivers never pass through a sewage treatment plant it is really really serious
14377 what if we manage the dams in the mountains in a different way what if we held the water in there instead of opening it up at different times in the year and ran it off in june and july when the water is low what would that do to the ecosystem
14378 right now there are large water users such as agriculture so agriculture right now is like the water bank
14379 theres a real problem with drawing on that water bank because water is food if you draw down on that water bank and take food out of the system where are we
14380 shit guys this script is amazing we gotta make this

14385 i dont think theyll be able to execute on all of them
14386 its a cool bold visionary project but it will be hard to do
14387 but when you have two or three of them it just really helps you focus in a little bit more
14388 when we were at offseason workouts i was having a couple of problems just because of my repetition
14389 well i feel that im back to where i was with catching the punts
14390 obviously i love touching the ball you get a little bit more joy when you run back a punt or get a touchdown for the most part i get the same joy on third and 4 when my receiver cant catch the ball
14391 seeing his abilities well coach to what he gives us a chance to do wade was pointing out how very interesting it is when you have a guy that can change direction like that and move around
14392 hes been one of the most excited people to be here
14393 hes a happy guy and no matter what you ask him to do whether it is the scout team or special teams whatever it might be hes responded in a positive way to everything

14396 this is why i am disappointed with the newspaper report as this does not reflect the content of the sms received by mca leaders
14397 the content is filtered so this service is for legitimate use

14416 in film school there was a lot of talk about how movies with mostly women characters lacked action
14417 they tended to be chatty talky and like a certain network i wont mention
14418 its just a matter of how you show it you show it in a way thats suspenseful and grabs you by the throat and the whole idea of frozen river was a very active setup where theyre really taking a physical risk in order to accomplish something and to survive to me that was automatically appealing and sort of disproved that theory out and out
14419 for the last 20 years actresses who are native have been trying to get the break native men have already received
14420 the roles where you can break out of the leathers and feathers they go to the men and the women are stuck in the background
14421 thats been the major fight not only to get a leading role as a woman but also to not be a pocahontas type talking to trees and whatnot to have actual depth and character that adds to the movie and this is the first time ive had a chance to play a character who actually has a personality who has emotions and depth
14422 whatever came up came up the less i tried the better it was if i was worried about it it became self conscious if i just said this is something in her character the things that she does that come from her culture itll pop up and it did
14423 people really bought into the small goal from the get go
14424 i think the stakes are in the crossing the smuggling itself has pretty high stakes so that keeps you compelled in terms of what happens in terms of the goal people accept it right away once you lay eyes on that single wide trailer you definitely are rooting for the double for something better
14425 lila and ray not only dont like each other and dont understand each other

14439 a strategic reserve can now be created by the united states out of some of the forces currently in iraq
14440 with some moving to other threatened areas and others returning to the united states
14441 its culmination should be a diplomatic conference charged with establishing a formal peace settlement
14442 establishing a deadline is the surest way to undermine the hopeful prospects
14443 it always struck me as strange that there wasnt a contemporary music strand during the edinburgh festival
14444 edinburgh doesnt really have the same live music tradition as glasgow
14445 but weve built up a situation where edinburgh has become far more attractive during august at least the crowds are bigger and the atmospheres amazing
14446 im looking forward to dan le sac vs scroobius pip they agreed to do this last minute one off show though they werent planning to tour maximo park i think are very underrated their gig should be a bit special and weve booked jay brannan who was in the film shortbus who i think will get under peoples skin a bit
14447 its difficult for edinburgh bands to find an audience during the festival
14448 you cant find venues because everythings so expensive and diy promoters are squeezed out were not in the fringe programme but well still go flyering up the royal mile
14449 if you guys know me if it was contract i wouldn t be here burress said
14450 i think i shouldnt have run with no tape on my ankles he said
14451 my number one thing is to be healthy thats the bottom line he said
14452 it doesn t have anything to do with contract anything like that if that was the case i wouldn t be here
14453 a little bit of structure according to tom coughlin who added
14454 he absolutely has to wear them all the time coughlin said
14455 its the same ankle but not the same injury coughlin said
14456 i know one time this summer i asked him about it and he really didnt think hed be limited but here we are
14457 hopefully just put em on try some things call up the nike people and make some tweaks to my shoes if it doesn t feel good with me just walking around orthotics are going to do anything
14458 im just trying to prevent what i went through last year he said
14459 i don t want to play at the same level i played at last year i want to be better the only way for me to do that is to rest get to be 100 percent and be healthy so i can go out and take my game to the next level

14463 netflix fans will soon have another new option for watching movies
14464 dealt with health care rights safety lots of rules during that time
14465 benefited from the changes when i returned to kansas and started working on the railroad again
14466 we need good kansas common sense straight along the line to make sure we have rights for the average citizen
14467 we have some real basic problems the system is broke and we need to have good kansas common sense in the system
14468 im very much a populist look after people the people need a lobbyist and thats what i plan to do bring common sense to u s senate
14469 this country is a great country and weve accomplished great things as a nation but over the last few years i think we have been suffering under some pretty weak leadership
14470 the real issues affecting the lives of kansans in a very direct way the choices that have been made in washington regrettably have been the wrong choices for kansas and the wrong choices for our country its time for change
14471 this policy i call intergenerational robbery is morally wrong its destabilizing our economy and its helping to drive up the price of gasoline
14472 and then on the energy front im just appalled at the fact that we dont have a sensible energy policy i was a deficit hawk before it was cool to be a deficit hawk
14473 its time for the people of this country and for the people of kansas to reclaim their country and to elect some new leadership
14474 obviously if one group or a large group controls information and only allows one perspective to be presented thats not good for democracy that is not good for the american public that is of course what the fairness doctrine is directed at and it can have great merit

14515 but i understand how competitive he is and how much pride he has about what he does on the field
14516 john will go on and continue to have much success im sure if he wants to play he can still play at a high level
14517 john came up to me and said mike if the season started today where do you see me
14518 he came back to me and said im a guy thats really got to be involved
14519 i dont think ive ever been with more of a pro than a guy like john lynch

14532 i know youre getting tired of people saying you look like a drug dealer therefore youre going to become one but you have to understand thats the impression you present do you think that hip hop rap and things in the movies influence you or its just an individual thing
14533 its both really but im not going to change for anybody else
14534 if you dont want to be looked at as a drug dealer you should not present that image what you present for the public to see is how youre looked at so when i see you i see a bunch of young wild kids
14535 we cant even have a conversation everybody has a right to their opinion were not here to judge people were here to talk about solutions
14536 we know how to represent ourselves like in a business meeting or something we know not to wear do rags and stuff but like he said hes not going to change for nobody we know how to represent ourselves in the proper way when it comes to it

14541 its easy for us to say im here because they didnt help me im here because of the white man im here because of x y and z but one thing im learning and im only 21 so im still learning is that until a man can wake up and look in the mirror and say im where i am because of decisions i made
14542 i guess i feel that but not all the way we need support if we fall we need somebody to pick us back up respecting ourselves the way we should somebody should sit down with us and tell us about it

14553 there were attacks that targeted senior officers and we thank god they failed and our colleagues are safe
14554 investigations are still ongoing to see who was behind the attacks and it is too early to point out motives although they appeared to be of al qaeda style
14555 on monday morning jul 21 we were startled by an explosion in the house of colonel issa al issawi who is known as the leader of the campaign against militants in fallujah and surroundings house
14556 to our surprise the explosion took place on the roof where at least four guards were posted
14557 one of them was warning his colleagues that the other was a suicide attacker and asking them to take cover then another policeman fired towards both of them
14558 all of us ran away and then the second bomb went off many policemen were killed and injured in the two blasts these have again ended our dreams of security
14559 col issawi has been a police officer for over 20 years meaning he is one of saddam husseins officers who agreed to continue although the country was occupied by the americans
14560 people of fallujah know that he helped al qaeda worked with the islamic party and now is the right arm of the american occupation
14561 we knew that many of the members of the awakening forces were members of al qaeda
14562 it was said that about 100 young men were executed inside fallujah police station by the awakening militias in january and february 2007 it became clear later that the executioners were fallujah police leaders following orders issued by the u s military from the headquarters next door
14563 it seems that we iraqis will all kill each other as long as this u s occupation is paying our leaders to widen the gap between us

14565 invito a pasar de las cr ticas y propuestas extra universitarias al debate
14566 invito a pasar de las cr ticas y propuestas extra universitarias al debate en los recintos de los rganos de gobierno de cara a la sociedad jalisciense
14567 hay un acuerdo de confidencialidad y nos parece que la agencia reguladora de estados unidos est muy cerca de haberlos violado porque carece de pruebas
14568 se tiene que trabajar con la fda para demostrarles cient ficamente que no tuvieron elementos y que se apresuraron a una decisi n que nos parece poco usual
14569 lo que ha hecho la fda es mandar una recomendaci n de no consumir chile jalape o ni serrano sin embargo sigue entrando libremente porque ellos saben que no tienen pruebas toda vez que tomaron las muestras junto con nosotros
14570 we need to make sure the states electric infrastructure is ready for the additional demand and we want to avoid problems that could crop up if say a high number of evs are charging on a 98 degree summer day when power is at a premium for air conditioners and other devices
14571 the benefits to our planet our businesses and families not to mention the potential cost savings from a coordinated and intelligently planned roll out of evs make connecticuts participation in ev integration discussions imperative
14572 connecticut has an opportunity to be a national leader in reducing our dependence on foreign energy sources
14573 we acknowledge the fact that were a church but we still have secular needs like paying our electricity
14574 one reason for sen mccains narrowing the gap is partly energy policy especially high gasoline prices
14575 mccain says he favors off shore drilling to increase gas supply a position backed by 60 percent of pennsylvania voters but opposed by obama and pennsylvania voters now say 56 to 35 percent that the energy policy is more important in the campaign than the iraq war
14576 the breadth of performance sea kayaking is fairly astounding this video should be in your library
14577 this video hits the mark quite neatly anyone watching this could not fail to pick up the most important points of long boat handling navigation skills and some basic rescues
14578 if you could have only one video about sea kayaking this would be a very good choice
14579 breadth depth and details make this video demand more than a one time survey a comprehensive sea kayaking instructional textbook
14580 we bought one for rental but discovered people want to own it so now we sell lots of them
14581 if you are serious about learning to sea kayak the video is well worth the price
14582 i believe that due to our educational activities throughout the city we have seen a big improvement
14583 they also know that when they talk with foreign friends they should not ask them how much their income is how old they are or whether they are married or not
14584 my girl likes to party all the time party all the time party all the tii iiime
14585 we have all natural chicken if thats what you mean
14586 you mean like did it run around a yard and peck at stuff before they killed it i dont know i wasnt there

14589 ahora podemos generar suministros ilimitados de las c lulas que mueren en esta horrible enfermedad esto nos permite estudiar estas neuronas y la ela en el laboratorio y descubrir qu es lo que sucede en el proceso de la enfermedad
14590 podemos generar cientos de millones de neuronas motoras que son gen ticamente id nticas a las propias neuronas del paciente
14591 a adi chris henderson de la columbia university en nueva york quien tambi n trabaj en la investigaci n
14592 es nuestra falta de comprensi n del proceso de la enfermedad la que nos impide desarrollar tratamientos m s efectivos

14594 if i couldnt go to a tap and get a drink of water i dont know what id do
14595 i dont really give it much thought actually i figure north battlefords got to have clean water bottled water just doesnt taste the same
14596 big city water in this country is absolutely fine but the problem with assuring safe potable water is that it takes a minimum degree of microbiological knowledge and engineering skill and a supporting infrastructure
14597 doing that requires you have a large enough customer base so you can afford the high quality relatively expensive services
14598 ontario is a paragon of sanity compared to british columbia where you have a third of the population and 4 000 water suppliers
14599 every small town every little place has its own jealously guarded water systems most of which have inadequate treatment
14600 the real problem with canadian drinking water quality is we have far too many rinky dink suppliers and theyre too small to produce the level of safety that our society seems to demand
14601 they can have effects on reproduction some pharmaceuticals estrogens testosterone some pesticides the endocrine system is the one that produces hormones and it is very very sensitive and there are chemicals in the water that influence the endocrine system of fish
14602 i think the reproductive effects are potentially important and we do hear about human fertility issues sperm count in males decreasing problems with learning difficulties in children allergies asthma cancers there are so many things we dont have an explanation for
14603 those systems will catch quite a few numbers of nasties like oils and very complex large chain molecules like pcbs they dont do well at all with these endocrine disruptors
14604 most pesticides and fertilizers that get into our streams and rivers never pass through a sewage treatment plant it is really really serious
14605 what if we manage the dams in the mountains in a different way what if we held the water in there instead of opening it up at different times in the year and ran it off in june and july when the water is low what would that do to the ecosystem
14606 right now there are large water users such as agriculture so agriculture right now is like the water bank
14607 theres a real problem with drawing on that water bank because water is food if you draw down on that water bank and take food out of the system where are we
14608 not quite as difficult as the giro but just as beautiful
14609 my time was 15 minutes faster than last year on the same course despite the rain and mud thats right mud the salzkammergut this year was a different challenge from 2007 thunderstorms the night before the race set the scene and it was raining steadily as we lined up on the starting grid
14610 it has had an absolutely profound effect upon his life
14611 he has committed so many offences against churches of the same denomination from which the order comes not to take property but simply to cause damage no doubt in response for the damage he was done as a young child
14612 this will make a sentence of imprisonment physically difficult and dangerous for the prisoner who is not in a position to stand up and defend himself
14613 your career and achievements within the order are dashed your lifes work is discredited your legacy is now that of a child abuser rather than a man who had considerable talents and gave them to the order over so many years

14616 i remember alan keyes i remember him using this in his campaign against me
14617 to provide age appropriate sex education science based sex education in schools
14618 you as a peer can have enormous power over your age cohort but youve got to have some support from the schools you certainly should not have to be fighting each and every instance by providing accurate information outside of the classroom because inside the classroom the only thing that can be talked about is abstinence
14619 keep in mind i honor and respect young people who choose to delay sexual activity
14620 ive got two daughters and i want them to understand that sex is not something casual thats something that we definitely want to communicate and should be part of any curriculum but we also know that when the statistics tell us that nearly half of 15 to 19 year olds are engaging in sexual activity that for us to leave them in ignorance is potentially consigning them to illness pregnancy poverty and in some cases death
14621 does not support teaching explicit sex education to children in kindergarten
14622 we will ask americans to serve we will create new opportunities to serve and we will direct that service to our most pressing national challenges
14623 set a goal for all american middle and high school students to perform 50 hours of service a year and for all college students to perform 100 hours of service a year
14624 you can take your diploma walk off this stage and chase only after the big house and the nice suits and all the other things that our money culture says you should
14625 fulfilling your immediate wants and needs betrays a poverty of ambition
14626 our collective service can shape the destiny of this generation
14627 we left corporate america which is a lot of what were asking young people to do
14628 dont go into corporate america become teachers work for the community be social workers be a nurse those are the careers we need and were encouraging people to do just that
14629 barack obama will require you to work he is going to demand that you shed your cynicism that you come out of your isolation that you move out of your comfort zone barack obama will never allow you to go back to your lives as usual uninvolved uninformed
14630 we cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives weve set weve got to have a civilian national security force thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
14631 people of all ages stations and skills will be asked to serve
14632 the future of our nation depends on the soldier at fort carson
14633 but it also depends on the teacher in east l a the nurse in appalachia the after school worker in new orleans
14634 o alex tinha duas propostas irrecus veis uma do jap o e outra dos emirados rabes uma delas at era por um contrato de dois anos ele foi muito transparente comunicando para o palmeiras e tivemos uma reuni o muito produtiva em que ele decidiu ficar

14638 i hope this gets people to look into the allegations
14639 they might still decide to vote for chris but this will be a way to make it more fair
14640 this is a direct attack from the other two democrats in this race
14641 its politics at its worst and hypocrisy at its highest level
14642 we need to send a very strong message to people that if youre going to immigrate to america youd better be ready to play by the rules otherwise youre not welcome
14643 they have to be legal you dont teach people the right thing to do by having no consequences
14644 i think we see sometimes when individuals are found that are known to be here illegally that the federal government needs to take action and follow up with that
14645 i think that its an issue that deserves some examination to see where it is today and whether or not the laws are appropriate but its something i want to study more
14646 part of this is that employers have created demand and the created demand has led us to this problem in addition to some economic factors throughout the continent
14647 i dont know about putting them in jail but i think you could penalize them very severely
14648 we need to have a centralized form of government in one language
14649 libertarians may differ on this issue but ive always been an open borders libertarian
14650 i think anyone who wants to come here and be peaceful and work should be able to thats what made our country great over the years

14660 the prices were very good in the fall and american farmers thought that 6 or 7 a bushel was a good price so they took it
14661 the proxy fight is over and it will not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose

14663 i look forward to working harmoniously with the new board of yahoo

14683 were pleased to hear that the swindlers said they proceeded to name all the colors and to explain the intricate pattern the old minister paid the closest attention so that he could tell it all to the emperor and so he did
14684 the swindlers at once asked for more money more silk and gold thread to get on with the weaving but it all went into their pockets not a thread went into the looms though they worked at their weaving as hard as ever

14712 its still flaming up there but theyve been on it day and night
14713 i kept hoping for the best so hearing its gone just kind of took the wind out of me
14714 it staggers the brain to think about how much devastation a fire can have how many people this affects
14715 typically we dont see wildland fires of this magnitude until much later in the season
14716 but with the dry fuel conditions that we have throughout the state we could see similar situations arise again until we get a significant amount of rain

14724 what we now have in the culture dish is cells that have the same genetic makeup as the als patient and they are the same cells that are affected by the disease
14725 there is no way we could go to an als patient and take these cells
14726 now we have to figure out whether these motor neurons are able to mature
14727 for these to be useful for drug development we need mature motor neurons
14728 up until now its been impossible to get access to the neurons affected by als and although everyone was excited by the potential of the new technology it was uncertain that we would be able to obtain them from patients skin cells
14729 our paper now shows that we can generate hundreds of millions of motor neurons that are genetically identical to a patients own neurons this will be an immense help as we try to uncover the mechanisms behind this disease and screen for drugs that can prolong life
14730 hillary clinton in not a political lego block easily replaced by another woman candidate
14731 governor sebelius while a good leader for kansas is not in any way an acceptable substitute for senator clinton
14732 i really dont care who he chooses as vice president because im not going to vote for him regardless
14733 the selection of either one of those instead of senator clinton i would find completely incomprehensible
14734 if anyone thinks that picking a woman will simply placate hillary clintons female supporters i think thats very patronizing to women and i dont think that that either governor sebelius or senator mccaskill would disagree

14763 the review of federal contracts from five government agencies conducted by the house small business committee is the latest to document missteps in the award of billions of dollars of lucrative government work since the 2005 storm the findings were provided wednesday to the associated press in advance of a hearing by the committee thursday at which officials from the five agencies were to testify about the contract awarding system the committees review found that small businesses in louisiana had an overall net loss of 8 9 million in contracting dollars since april when the agencies reaffirmed their commitment to give smaller companies a share of the work the loss was due in part to a decision at the homeland security department to modify several existing agreements instead of awarding significant new contracts in addition the review found the five agencies homeland security general services administration defense veterans affairs and small business administration had claimed falsely that 259 contracts were awarded to small businesses when in fact they went to large companies or ineligible recipients that created the false impression that more than 95 million in contracts was awarded to small companies when they actually went elsewhere overall about 7 4 percent of katrina contracts so far have gone to small businesses in louisiana down from 12 5 percent in april according to the committee

14784 i think its flattering that one of george bushs allies on the other side of the world started attacking me the day after i announced my candidacy
14785 i would also note that we have close to 140 000 troops in iraq and my understanding is mr howard has deployed 1 400
14786 so if he is to fight the good fight in iraq i would suggest that he calls up another 20 000 australians and sends them to iraq otherwise its just a bunch of empty rhetoric

14801 roddy finally realized not only to recognize that change from the defense but to react as fast as it was happening joe really opened his eyes as far as his understanding of the game went
14802 hes commanding the huddle which is always a good thing for a young quarterback
14803 hes coming in there and putting guys in the right spots when we make a mistake he can point it out and tell us where to go
14804 argonne national laboratory is one of the u s department of energys largest research centers it is also the nations first national laboratory chartered in 1946
14805 running away eh you yellow bastards come back here and take whats coming to you ill bite your legs off
14806 it was a hard decision i know im doing it for the right reasons
14807 i know how i feel about my country i love what america stands for and that were the free world but freedom has never been free people have paid for it
14808 if you play in this country live in this country and you grow up in the heartland and you put on a russian uniform you are not a patriotic person
14809 they had a long time to give me the opportunity
14810 if becky was given a fair shake to begin with than maybe she would be in a u s uniform
14811 i wish her well to each their own i mean we have people doing much worse in the world
14812 i think a lot of things are often blurred with patriotism
14813 major league soccer has done an impressive job of bringing an exciting brand of professional soccer to north america
14814 the popularity and passion for soccer is deeply rooted within our community and we firmly believe our city is more than ready to embrace an mls team over the next few months we will be working closely with the regions soccer community and all levels of government to prepare a comprehensive submission to the league
14815 im a player that loves to play the game it doesnt matter what uniform i put on i always go out there and play nine innings hard
14816 im a winner i come to win and ill always be like that
14817 in theory i think we upgraded offensively pudge is obviously still having a tremendous year one of the top catchers in the game today
14818 we signed molina obviously to be a backup catcher and hes one of the premier backups in the game today
14819 he stepped up and did a tremendous job here to hold the fort down while we were going through our stuff with jorgie
14820 there were things i was not comfortable with its a sellers market if you want to meet the sales price then obviously you can get a deal but i wasnt willing to do that
14821 im ready to rock n roll if we could match up with somebody we just couldnt match value for value in the marketplace
14822 how do i plug in my usb webcam digital camera exotic hardware to veejay
14823 at the end of the day youre taking the field with a guy who doesnt want to play with you doesnt want to be there doesnt want to obviously effort wise is just not there and thats disheartening and disappointing
14824 its very obvious from anything you see or hear he doesnt want to be here and anytime that theres a piece of the equation you have a problem and then not trading and leaving him here is a problem because you dont know what youre going to get
14825 hmm sounds like someone we know my choice for 1 on times list gar on de piss
14826 the red sox were sold for 90m less than the highest bid when they picked john henry and tom werner major league baseball doesn t care about what sam zell s troubles are
14827 you never know whether it will become chronic or not
14828 hell do everything he can to play on sunday im looking forward to him rehabbing and being back for that dallas game
14829 orr shows up every day in practice making a play doing something
14830 hes shown up rushing the passer some as an inside linebacker as an outside linebacker he does have some versatility which is good
14831 i got behind early and didnt like the direction the game was headed but we hung in there and the offense came alive and settled down
14832 i dont expect him to go out and throw eight shutout innings
14833 im just looking for the actions in his pitches how he competes and mound presence
14834 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
14835 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us
14836 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
14837 that was a 1 2 tandem that was one of the best in the game
14838 e imparai con umilt e fatica ma imparai quello che dovevo fare
14839 i was sitting at home doing nothing and all of a sudden a team wants me
14840 he gives manager cecil cooper one more weapon to call upon late in the game
14841 as ive said all along weve got three quarterbacks battling for the position
14842 j ts not back in it hes been in it this quarterback position is open whoever gives us the best chance to win is the guy
14843 i think right now its just organized chaos and theyre just trying to learn all this stuff
14844 i had no expectations about when my reps would come
14845 im strictly about me being ready if they would have said the first day to jump in there i would have been ready if they say a month from now im going to be ready its about me doing my job as well as i can it doesnt change if im in the first group or the fifth group
14846 i feel fine its just noticeably tired coaches felt like i needed a rest so thats what we did its kind of normal for this time of year were ready to go now
14847 he was in a lot of pain down in the tunnel
14848 i think it was frustration with getting hit and frustration just in general with his last few at bats
14849 its not a secret that it was disappointing not only statswise but even to my personal standards
14850 i did some evaluating and i think i made the necessary adjustments as far as conditioning and getting myself ready to come back this year and make improvements
14851 what i learned over these last six years that ive been here is that year to year its unpredictable what happens with players and contracts and those type of things
14852 im worried about playing football right now im not even really looking forward to next season or whats going to happen after that weve got to get focused on making it happen right now
14853 i played it in college i played it in high school the times i did play defense in high school the left handed stance is my natural stance the left hand is my strong hand there are a lot more moves and power available on that side
14854 barring anything unknown theres no reason he wont go out and set records i think
14855 i was only sick for two weeks i will say during that time i lost weight a little bit of strength and probably some explosiveness and things like that
14856 i feel a little stronger i feel more powerful faster a little bigger
14857 ive got a little more weight im pleased with what i did this offseason
14858 they really wanted me to get down there to see their place they called coach
14859 coach took the day off and helped me make the 12 hour drive down after staying in the hotel overnight we met them this morning and visited the school
14860 he was asking me how the visit went i told him i loved it he said im hoping after today that i would be done with recruiting a punter do you want to be the punter at lsu
14861 i was like wow i took a bathroom break to collect myself i then came back in there and he asked again if i wanted to be the punter at lsu thats when i committed
14862 hes a black belt in karate he might not say that it has much to do with how he punts but i think it really does he has tremendous hang time he can really get it up there lsu said his hang time was something that really impressed them
14863 there are some schools that are recruiters and some schools that are selectors
14864 lsu is one of those schools no matter how things dont work out for derek he now gets a chance to play in front of 95 000 fans in death valley and with guys that will be in the nfl some day i know they dont have glen dorsey or jamarcus russell anymore but its lsu you can count on them having four other guys like that already on the roster
14865 i met him once and he was very kind to me i never got a chance to tell him what i thought that he was my hero
14866 i spent five years in a hospital after the war this is one of the secret awards i wanted i was hoping this would happen in my lifetime and it did
14867 they dropped down the age to enlist to 18 i signed my mothers name and she was not happy about that
14868 i never turned down anything and never argued with any producer or director
14869 because youre on scare tactics hahahaha your asshole friend sheila set you up you fucking retarded ass infection

14874 while it would have been more promising to have had mr cunliffe shouting his call from the rooftops rather than in a small article buried on page seven of a single newspaper such a move to break down the barrier between public and private health services is a step forward in the provision of quality care for new zealanders

14889 i havent been able to launch half of my ideas because i just dont have the time to create them
14890 sharing with a community on the internet in this way could be thought of as risky because there is always the chance that someone will run off with a good idea but its just a likely to happen if i developed in private i could try and produce everything myself but im already too busy
14891 registering with webequity will mean i finally get some of my projects off the ground and gives me access to specialist skills to ensure a professional result 10 of something is better than 100 of nothing and if someone thinks the ideas are good enough to copy ill take that as a compliment

14932 social issues crime and safety issues are at the bottom of the list
14933 but if you ask directly about gay marriage abortion and those types of things washington has historically been on the liberal side of the question
14934 the pro life side has lost five separate times at the polls

14936 dino voted with the bipartisan majority in the state senate affirming the traditional view of marriage between one man and one woman he is not a supporter of gay marriage
14937 washington is a compassionate state we will find a way to guarantee the ability of people to take care of themselves and their loved ones and at the same time respect the traditional institution of marriage he would have to consider it on a case by case basis but not if it was a step towards legalizing same sex marriage

14941 this is a historic step forward in the fight for equal rights for women
14942 some will have you believe that the wage gap for women is a myth that we already have laws in place to make pay discrimination on the basis of gender illegal
14943 but just because something is illegal does not mean that it does not continue to happen
14944 isnt needed to protect women from wage discrimination such protection is already found in the law
14945 at the end of the day this bill will invite more lawyers to file more lawsuits because it offers them a bigger payday
14946 the bill before the house treats pay discrimination as systemic
14947 this bill does little more than dole out favors to the democrats trial lawyer allies with no new benefit to protect workers
14948 more difficult and error prone and invite a surge of litigation

14975 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
14976 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
14977 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
14978 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
14979 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
14980 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic
14981 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
14982 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting

15009 likeness becomes real and fantasy touches on the believable the viewer is suspended in disbelief
15010 and you me ben all of us are all just passengers on the river sitting in our little rafts being swept along by history
15011 we can change our direction a little as were swept along by the river of history an action here an action there and we might end up somewhere slightly different to where we would otherwise have ended up
15012 so we can steer along the river but we cant change where the river goes
15013 if it bends in a direction we dont like a little further up we have no choice but to follow it around and steer ourselves as best as we are able
15014 imagine now kitty that you were on your raft on the river and you didnt particularly like this part of the river and imagine also that you were able to send a note back a few hundred feet to one of the rafts back there telling them how awful the river was up here
15015 good now imagine that the people on the rafts back behind you agreed that the part of the river you were on sounded awful and that they all decided that they would try and make the river go somewhere else
15016 working as one the group back there drop a whole heap of rocks in the river where they are and change its course perhaps just a little at first but imagine also that they send a message back a few hundred feet from where they are telling the people back there about the necessity for changing the course of the river
15017 so the people back there drop rocks in the river as well and presumably pass the message back and so on and so forth
15018 working as a team a dedicated group of people can change the course of the river we can change the future to make it how we like it
15019 kitty in two hundred years time a great man will invent a machine that can send memories two years back in time he will send the memory of how to build the machine back to his two years younger self he will in turn send it back to another earlier self who will in turn share the technology with others eventually this technology will be shared all the way back to the early 1400s which is the earliest point at which we had tools that could build the machine even then it took up half a castle from that point on we have used this technology to see and shape the future

15127 nick jonas is my role model i think its cool how he can tell the world about his diabetes my dad had cancer and diabetes and he passed away last year its amazing how he can get through this with the help of his family
15128 this might be a funny place to start but what are your thoughts on the recent trend of american players like josh childress signing with teams overseas for more money when they still have offers to play in the nba
15129 i like that i like that situation i like what those guys are doing theyre taking their destinies into their own hands and saying hey i want to play at a high level of basketball and i want to be compensated in a way that i feel is fair for me so if another team is going to pay me that then i need to move to greece or italy which are beautiful places to do it then i have to do it i like that it sends a message
15130 some nba fans might be a little worried that if the league continues to lose players to europe then the quality might dip a little bit
15131 id rather have the best product we can have but wed have to take away guaranteed contracts and do a whole bunch of stuff to have that happen
15132 but why say no for the honor and the privilege to play in the nba yeah i understand that part because it is a privilege and an honor but at the end of the day youre just trying to make it fair
15133 do you think your new team the sixers are ready to contend for the eastern title the way youre constituted right now
15134 you know i dont know i know well definitely compete and i know we should be in the playoffs but how quickly we jell and grow that takes time even the celtics they won it but they had veterans that came in with one goal and one goal only they grew during the season the pistons have been mainstays in the eastern conference finals for the last seven years or six out of seven years or whatever it is and orlandos gotten better theyve been together but i know were going to compete with all those teams for sure
15135 were you as surprised as everyone to see how well the sixers did last season
15136 yeah absolutely absolutely i was following them a little bit and i knew they had cap space some cap space and i was following em and at the beginning of the season they were just down but at the second half of the season they were one of the best teams in the nba not only in the east but in the nba period
15137 because of your film company and the amount of time youve spent with the clippers i think most people forget that youre an east coast guy how much of a factor was location in coming back to the sixers
15138 location was huge i grew up in peekskill n y which isnt that far from philly my wifes a newark n j girl and we have our first child on the way so you have that support group of family and nothings better than family and theyre not two minutes away theyre still away but location definitely had a big part in the thought process i had a higher offer from another team on the west coast outside of the clippers but being in the east with this young team really spoke to me about where i am in my career trying to compete for championships and take my game and my team to the next level
15139 a lot of people were surprised when baron davis announced he was going to the clippers and they assumed it was a foregone conclusion that you were going to re sign were people jumping the gun in thinking that
15140 no no that was the correct thought process to have i was with the clippers for so long and we were in negotiations for a contract but it fell through but no they werent wrong for thinking that because thats the way we intended it to happen thats what my goal was to do that
15141 baron obviously wouldve made the situation in l a more attractive for you right
15142 yeah barons a great player and i wish him well there and he would have made the situation a lot more attractive with that team for sure
15143 so have you guys talked much since he signed there
15144 yeah we still talk probably once a week still he does stuff in the community and hes in the movie industry so we talk about stuff like that
15145 you played with usa basketball in 2006 are you confident theyre coming back from china with the gold
15146 as long as theyre confident im confident i know coach k and mr colangelo will have those guys totally prepared and the way everythings run is first rate im definitely saddened because of my injury that i couldnt be a part of it but i definitely think theyll bring the gold back there have been some small injuries and stuff like that but the team that they have the guys are certainly selfless and their goal is to win the gold they dont have role players but the superstars on that team are the role players youve got a guy like dwyane wade coming off the bench i played with him in 06 and he passed he played d he played hard so i think theyre going to rise to the occasion and bring that gold back
15147 they obviously understand the pressure and the importance of winning it all after losing in 04
15148 absolutely thats what usab instilled in the team the last two years family togetherness and teamwork and those guys are playing like that and theyre going to play like that i expect the gold i dont want to put too much pressure on them though
15149 what was the hardest part about coming back from rupturing your achilles
15150 the fear of learning to trust it and wondering if youll ever have your explosiveness back and if youll ever be able to play at this level again so playing the last eight games of last season and having 20 points in my first game back and winning that game really just help me jump that hurdle no pun intended and i felt great about it after that
15151 after seeing shaun livingstons career take the turn that it has due to a knee injury its got to be every athletes greatest fear to suffer a debilitating injury like that
15152 wait a minute what would happen if we created an airline that only connected dallas houston and san antonio
15153 im sorry i didnt mean what i said last night
15154 i dont remember anything that happened in it but i didnt mean what i said
15155 i told you i hope you die today but i didnt mean it im sorry
15156 uh okay well i didnt know you said it so dont worry
15157 i bought another guitar for guitar hero me and victoria went halves
15158 our education system often teach brilliant children as if they are mentally challenged and most are never inspired to reach early intellectual potential
15159 i think it really depends on what the class is to blog about after many years with a child that has asbergers syndrome autism knowing his strong point is the computer i must agree however in classes with teachers that are just there for the paycheck well theres a different matter you would be surprised how many teachers are computer illiterate
15160 all right put on the brakes food for thought if blogging is an art form and a way to express ourselves then it would be a good thing to encourage our children to blog however and this is where a line of demarcation should be drawn they should only be encouraged to do this internally within their school system this way they learn many necessary skills and begin to develop and learn to enjoy interaction with others on a wholly more intrinsic level than they would in the classroom or on the playground as long as the school monitored the blog interactions to keep the children safe perhaps they would be more supportive of one another and less prone to violence allowing them to blog on the internet would be pure folly
15161 the idea of intranet blogs for school systems is however a stroke of genius
15162 links with analysis and synthesis that articulates a deeper understanding or relationship to the content being linked to and written about with potential audience response in mind
15163 as long as the school monitored the blog interactions to keep the children safe perhaps they would be more supportive of one another and less prone to violence

15178 the actors in 1930s and 1940s movies had a naturalism to their performances i wanted to recapture that with this cast i showed them rebecca brief encounter which james and keira particularly adore and in which we serve to name a few
15179 joe would direct us to deliver our lines swiftly he wanted the dialogue scenes to play as they did in classic british movies he likened it to rain pattering down or bullets firing doing that informed our performances and showed us who our characters were it was exciting to play because that particular style of speaking is now lost its like doing an accent yet it made everything easier
15180 keira just flew with that style of acting for the rest of us it took a little bit longer

15242 weve been given all these criteria from the afl that wed be expected to meet as i presume the other bids would be expected to meet and we are slowly ticking them all off
15243 we may be a small state population wise but we have a long proud history of australian football being played in tasmania we are passionate supporters of the game and increasingly were seeing that we can put together a sustainable business case
15244 best possible chance to recover and prepare for the 2009 pre season
15245 it is a combination of fewer housing transactions because buying a house is a key time when people change supplier and more people buying mobile broadband instead of fixed line access
15246 protestations from the company that the year will turn out ok may not carry much weight in the current environment and the share price would seem to be reflecting doubts over the sustainability of the dividend
15247 i would like to speak to an attorney before i answer preferably someone who specializes in intellectual property
15248 i just changed the entire course of history so that thinks for a moment says irreverent out loud then irrelevant the following post is a lot about who i am sadly
15249 i can now say im the first mission to mars to touch and then taste the water
15250 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
15251 this is steve jobs you think im an arrogant expletive who thinks hes above the law and i think youre a slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong
15252 let me have what youre drinking i want to get loaded too
15253 do sens clinton biden hagel kennedy etc too want america to lose a war or do they simply disagree with mccains judgment
15254 it gives an insight on what the team is doing and it informs you of some things that you didnt know where going on
15255 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
15256 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton rev jackson sen mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
15257 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
15258 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
15259 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
15260 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
15261 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
15262 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
15263 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
15264 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
15265 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
15266 i respect and admire sen obama we just have stark differences
15267 campaigns are tough but im proud of the campaign we have run
15268 im proud of the issues we have tried to address with the american people all i can say is we are proud of that commercial
15269 we can most assuredly tell you that voters around the country do not think theres anything substantive about this latest ad do not think its something that john mccain should be proud of
15270 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
15271 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
15272 itd be remiss to say that we dont enjoy playing on the other systems and we have a lot of respect for the work that miyamoto san and nintendo do
15273 but i think its a logical extension of our gamercard gamertag and achievements
15274 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
15275 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
15276 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
15277 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
15278 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
15279 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
15280 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime
15281 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible
15282 made it clear we wouldnt be leaving until we signed
15283 how much does the system weigh and what happens when it runs out of juice when im screaming down
15284 according to a tv special on him his helicopter is hugely modified to be able to do this and live

15291 no u s corporation ever made that much in a quarter
15292 but while big oil is making record profits you are paying record prices at the pump and our economy is leaving working people behind
15293 4 billion each year to the oil companies including 1 2 billion for exxon mobil alone
15294 pad oil company profits and save you at best half a tank of gas
15295 all those negative ads hes running wont do a thing to lower your gas prices or lift up the debate in this country
15296 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
15297 i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can do is that what this election is really all about is that worthy of the
15298 has failed the american people on energy and that failure has led directly to our current crisis
15299 thats how america is going to free itself from our dependence on foreign oil not through short term gimmicks but through a real long term commitment to transform our energy sector
15300 im not interested in getting into a tit for tat thats not going to lower your gas prices

15336 he came in took about four steps into the room and saw all these guys with guns and his mouth fell open and he was rooted to the spot
15337 all of the heavens eyes are on you and your partner
15338 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
15339 but he has never been in a jam like this
15340 im not positive of the reasons behind this past years infestation but we have invaded their territory

15343 the blockhouse was still there the greenock church steeple and the tall water tower of the algonquin still stood above the town another summer had begun
15344 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
15345 the attacker was standing up right over the top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him in the chest area
15346 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us

15352 from the right have come attacks based on cultural anxieties of being overrun by mexican immigrants and fears that cooperation with canada and mexico could lead down a slippery slope toward a north american union
15353 from the left came attacks based on economic fears of jobs lost due to unfair trading practices
15354 these two sets of fears came together in a perfect storm that was pushed forward by a surplus of hot air from talk show hosts on radio and television
15355 in the face of this criticism the bush administration was silent and the democratic candidates competed for votes in the rust belt states where unions and many working people have come to see nafta and globalization much as commentator lou dobbs does
15356 dobbs among others viewed a report by a 2005 council on foreign relations task force which i chaired building a north american community as the manifesto of a conspiracy to subvert american sovereignty
15357 dobbs claimed that the cfr study proposed a north american union although it did not
15358 i do not propose a north american union i propose a north american community

15478 perhaps the only thing more outrageous than exxon mobil making record profits while americans are paying record prices at the pump is the fact that senator mccain has proposed giving them an additional 1 2 billion tax break while senator mccains plan has succeeded in helping his campaign raise over 1 million from oil and gas company executives and employees just last month it wont lower gas prices or end our dangerous dependence on foreign oil

15557 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

15578 this federal housing package represents a significant move in the right direction for california homeowners
15579 the measure will not only help thousands of borrowers facing financial trouble stay in their homes but pave the way for thousands more to achieve the dream of becoming first time homeowners and help move otherwise skeptical buyers off the fence
15580 with more buyers able to enter the market and greater access to affordable loan products that wont have home buyers struggling six months down the road to make their payments we can expect to see more buyers coming back into the market
15581 increased access to mortgage capital is a key provision of this measure and will significantly improve the options for these first time buyers here in our state where home prices remain among the highest in the nation
15582 by providing the gse with a solid regulator and giving the treasury the authority to step in and ensure the financial well being of the gse this new legislation should restore investor confidence in fannie and freddie allowing them to continue to create programs that make the home buying process an affordable and viable one for all
15583 this federal housing bill is a significant move in the right direction for california homeowners
15584 it will aid in stabilizing our economy and help stem foreclosures while also providing support to first time homeowners
15585 although we would have liked congress to make permanent the current 729 750 loan limit c a r is pleased with the new permanent loan limit of 625 500 it will allow california homeowners to refinance their loans into safe affordable loan products and allow first time home buyers to enter the market

15602 i told my son it felt like a movie scene it didnt seem real

15605 that tells me they knew they were coming into a dangerous weather pattern and trying to get away from it
15606 that aircraft can get above it but when youre already in it its tough to do

15621 when i sign this order thousands of pink slips will start going out across the state and im also cancelling all overtime except for public safety and 24 hour medical care and im ordering also a hiring freeze and effective for the august payroll tens of thousands of state employees will be paid the federal minimum wage until a budget is passed and then of course they will get reimbursed their salaries

15658 para abordar el problema de los hoteles de lanzarote en situaci n irregular
15659 una de las primeras cosas que se hizo fue tomar conciencia del problema y tener voluntad de corregirlo en el caso de los residuos municipales en aquel momento ten amos nicamente recogida selectiva de vidrio y muy incipientemente de papel
15660 hab a que abordar ese frente no s lo por la cantidad sino porque genera problemas asociados con la gesti n de los residuos as como de lixiviaci n en los vertederos y emisi n de gases de efecto invernadero
15661 fue clave pero a partir de ah se abord la dotaci n de infraestructuras para albergar y tratar esa materia org nica como son las plantas de compostaje
15662 fueron un municipio de 15 000 habitantes y otro de 3 000 aquello demostr que era posible hacer la recogida y hacerla bien para dar un producto de alta calidad
15663 ten amos que buscar la mejor manera de llevar la materia org nica desde las casas hasta las instalaciones
15664 por un lado est el que obliga al ciudadano a desplazarse fuera de su casa y depositar la materia org nica en un contenedor la otra opci n es aquella que denominamos puerta a puerta en sta el ciudadano efect a la separaci n en su domicilio y la saca a la puerta de su casa tanto en viviendas unifamiliares como en edificios
15665 para que todo esto funcione tiene que estar bien optimizado facilitando la recogida selectiva de las fracciones y limitando lo m s posible aquello que no es separado selectivamente
15666 si el municipio no ha establecido una ordenanza municipal que obliga a seleccionar los residuos simplemente informa y pide la colaboraci n de la gente el ciudadano se mueve por voluntad de esta manera la gente que quiere lo hace y la que no no lo hace es una situaci n conflictiva porque no s lo no se consigue el efecto deseado sino que puede pasar que el que mezcla la basura contamina la de quienes se han tomado la molestia de separar
15667 ha permitido captar los mayores porcentajes de recogida selectiva global en catalu a municipios que no hac an recogida selectiva de materia org nica y hac an algo de cristal papel o envases ten an niveles globales de recogida selectiva de un 15 o un 20 con lo cual el 80 restante iba al vertedero o a la incineradora pues bien hasta 60 municipios que contabilizamos en los que se ha hecho la recogida puerta a puerta han llegado a niveles de hasta el 60 o el 80 de recogida selectiva con lo cual s lo un 20 va al vertedero o al incinerador

15695 im sure it was a cultural and pharmaceutical event i was tied up at the time
15696 it was a time of uncertainty hope and change the summer of
15697 half a world away another kind of love of country john mccain shot down bayoneted tortured
15698 its still a good way to draw a stark contrast between you and the other guy
15699 there is a constant strain in the republican playbook of playing off the 1960s the same way people played off the civil war for decades and then the depression
15700 many of our people have already gone beyond the traditional electoral processes to achieve change we think that the energies released are creating a new constituency for america many people are coming to chicago with a sense of new urgency and a new approach
15701 and then i do this and then i do this and then i do this
15702 makes us more desirable to them whats forgotten theyre paying for our attention and it gives us a fucking break
15703 i fucking hate it when girls come in token girls thinking theyre one of the lads that theyre exempt cheering along like it makes no odds to them
15704 i bet when they get home they jiggle their tits around like thats the way they like it
15705 i bet they acts it out for him then go frig themselves in the bathroom
15706 go to any lapdancing club in the country and its the same london bradford cornwall its all the same you twirl yourself around their crotch jiggle your tits and narrow your eyes where did it all come from
15707 im not ashamed of you i just dont want to see you dancing for other men
15708 nice moves but your boyfriend just left which one was he anyway
15709 he was at the back he didnt have a dance
15710 no but we agreed didnt we why did you see me
15711 no i mean i saw a stag party come in but you werent with them there was someone a bit like you but he was all red faced groping one of the girls sweating
15712 lei dont be a nob talk to me why is this a problem suddenly
15713 i want you to shake your tits for me while i fuck you hard from behind
15714 dont see why not its not like you need to be here is it you could be anything journalist teacher
15715 i want to sit and bang my shoe on the table as a gavel like kruschev
15716 it should not be barry allen rebirth because our job is much bigger than that
15717 then i have to design black lanterns representing the dead from every single planet in the entire universe
15718 i thought the train decapitated superman and it gave me nightmares
15719 it could have been cary grant for all i know spitting on people
15720 im trying in my own comics to recreate the feeling i got from that four issue miniseries
15721 i really thought then that horror and superheroes work together very very well
15722 i think ive had a very bad influence on geoff johns
15723 a walking skeleton in las vegas with a million playing cards flying around him
15724 well known maybe well worn superhero concepts make them scary make them upsetting in some way
15725 yeah geoff said that he always wants to keep you wondering
15726 one of these comic book characters in fact that exists in a much more pure fashion than youd ever seen him drawn
15727 the phoenix that existed in my imagination was so interesting and had to come out on paper
15728 i think thats the coolest thing ever i just cant bring myself to draw a naked guy painted red running i cant do it
15729 inventive ways to demonstrate what it is to be the flash
15730 take flash comics into a third dimension and i dont mean putting on 3 d glasses
15731 putting on those beautiful rubber boots that i wish i had a pair of
15732 flash and green lantern are similar characters theyre brother books that should be purchased together by the same fans
15733 im redesigning wally wests costume right now and its terrifying
15734 wally west is the most perfectly designed costume ever aside from green lanterns costume in my opinion
15735 i want barry to come back and be king arthur hes the most straight laced perfect flash rigid in his morality and his ethics
15736 theres room for barry and wally and jay and possibly bart you never know somewhere down the road
15737 i spoke to frank quitely a lot i picked his brain and tried to follow closely what he did
15738 im drawing this story about a little boy and i want to have animals maul him
15739 i was out of there as soon as i could be except i hid
15740 sometimes youll fall on your face other times youll come up with something really cool that will stick and the next generation will follow you
15741 we are so enamored with the past that we cant see the future
15742 id have to have macular degeneration to confuse batman with a bat what im seeing and what im reading theres a lie somewhere here being told let me fix it if batmans supposed to be confused for a bat in the dark we need to see less of muscle guy with a cape and more of guy trying to disguise himself as something hes not
15743 i think its what bill finger and bob kane meant but werent able to completely sell in their own work and it got xeroxed and xeroxed until it became adam west in the 1960s
15744 they light em up and police the universe they shine the light and the cockroaches scamper its never been done that way before
15745 guy gardner had a yellow ring sinestro was a green lantern hal became parallax
15746 theres something really big here that nobody else has noticed roygbiv
15747 if someone did something horrible to you or your family and there was nothing you could do about it the ring comes you make that stupid choice and youre vomiting red energy and bile until youre just a walking animal that spits hatred everywhere whoops you made a mistake but thats how it happens
15748 compassion self denial the desire to help your fellow man
15749 the most noble creatures would get that kind of ring and renounce worldly goods
15750 all through it there are clues to this it all makes sense together its not just about separation everything merges together
15751 because i think what i tell him might be dumb hes an intellect about these things
15752 lets give the rings out to everybody and just have big fights because thats what i want to do
15753 ive got something so cool i wish i could tell you
15754 be like green lantern rebirth in terms of the way its going to be presented
15755 never has there been a rebellion with so little to rebel about
15756 if youre going to san francisco be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
15757 people sometimes tell me that they prefer barbarism to civilization i doubt they have given it a long enough trial they are bored with civilization but all the evidence suggests that the boredom of barbarism is infinitely greater quite apart from the discomforts and privations there was no escape from it very restricted company no books no light after dark no hope on one side the sea battering away on the other infinite stretches of bog and forest a most melancholy existence and the anglo saxon poets had no illusions about it
15758 a wise man will grasp how ghastly it shall be when all this worlds wealth standeth waste even as now throughout this middle earth walls stand wind beaten heavy hoar frost ruined habitations the wine halls crumble their wielders lie bereft of bliss and so he destroyed this city he the creator of men that human laughter is not heard about it and idle stand these ancient works of giants
15759 and so he destroyed this city he the creator of men that human laughter is not heard about it
15760 conservative ideals have consistently had salutary effects upon culture in contrast liberalism has never been better than a mixed blessing and was often destructive to western culture it was destructive because it propagated false views about the nature of man society government and the cosmos
15761 if we precipitously withdraw from vietnam the press will be ejected a curtain of silence will go down and the night of the long knives will begin
15762 we are none other than a moving row of magic shadow shapes that come and go round the sun illumed lantern held in midnight by the master of the show but helpless pieces of the game he plays upon his chequer board of nights and days hither and thither moves and checks and slays and one by one back into the closet lays
15763 it sounds a little bit crazy and its definitely not our intention to be campaigning in favour of one or the other
15764 ordinary new zealanders can still say what you like do what you like protest shout chant slogans and walk to the steps of parliament or whatever

15768 and what sir redbaiter do you think of my green party question above

15770 i find that what im doing now is challenging its really challenging to go up in a purely acoustic format we dont even plug in there are no pick ups in our instruments we just go right off the microphone
15771 i dont know if god put me in that position so i could be the voice of reason
15772 i dont know to this day i often wonder how i
15773 but i never was really playing in as dangerous an area as my compatriots were as far as recreational pursuits
15774 the film is set in the swinging 60s when fashion was wild and body hair even wilder
15775 sienna was an absolute star throughout filming and her performance was flawless
15776 the only slight problem being that shes very much a girl of the noughties and this extends to her personal upkeep unfortunately brazilians werent common in the 60s and siennas part involved one or two nude scenes meaning that her grooming habits were on full display
15777 siennas private parts were digitally enhanced giving her a rather unruly loud and proud bush
15778 in a usga championship theres no mystery to what you have to do
15779 and thats put the ball in play i dont think i missed a fairway he didnt hitting 14 of 14 i struck the ball nicely and i made a couple of nice par putts which you have to do
15780 so i had a couple of nice par saves and a couple of nice birdies
15781 maybe i left a couple of chances out there but overall im very happy
15782 theres a lot of movement youve got to put the ball in the right spot in order to feel confident about knocking putts in because of the terrain everything running away from the mountains you are going to have an extremely fast putt i had some putts where i barely took the putter back

15786 estamos satisfechos se han clarificado muchas cosas por eso estamos pidiendo que estas reuniones sean constantes
15787 hay cosas que nos preocupan como el concepto que dio el ministro de econom a de modular el gasto entiendo que eso puede significar desacelerar las inversiones
15788 recortar es quitar algo que necesitas modular el presupuesto significa repensar tus prioridades y crear espacios fiscales en caso de que lo necesites
15789 se respetar n los montos presupuestados al cierre de 2008
15790 creemos que debe haber una asignaci n especial para las regiones m s pobres porque s lo con una inversi n agresiva se puede tener resultados en el corto plazo

15798 while financial services are just one of many services the us and eu have made a liberalised financial sector their main demand on developing countries it has been revealed for instance that the eu has demanded that some developing countries eliminate regulations that cover the activities of hedge funds
15799 the 100 billion that fled the region in a few short weeks in the summer of 1997 brought economic growth to a screeching halt from korea all the way down to indonesia

15808 as one of the original co authors of not only this bill but the original legislation in 2003 it has been a tremendous bipartisan effort to get to this day
15809 this bill is the latest in a long string of bipartisan initiatives on global hiv aids that have been born out of a willingness to work together and put the united states on the right side of history when it comes to this global pandemic despite his failings on so many critical issues the president deserves recognition for working with congress to enact this important legislation

15833 in these demonstration videos the input excitation energy was around five volts at 600 milliamps 3 watts from zero to 436 milliamps the rollers remain stationary however if the voltage is increased by just two volts the speed dramatically increases coils spaced at regular intervals are there to replace the magnetic effect of the second ring plate a small current is applied to stabilise the rotation the configuration in the youtube demonstration does produce a small current in excess of the current applied to the coils these measurements were required for us to obtain the first patent once rotation is initiated the rollers speed up to a working speed which in the full seg increases as more current is drawn from the device these mock up versions of the seg were not designed for power output or electricity generation they simply illustrate that continuous rotation is possible and provide a model to evaluate why the rollers spin why they stay on the plate and what input power is necessary for operation this has helped us to determine what rare earth material is necessary to provide the input power keeping in mind that rare earth has its own inherent voltage
15834 the bell is not in any way similar to schaubergers research the purported research of the pre war vril gesellschaft or even the coanda effect saucer research associated with various names and the peenemuende rocket research center however both schaubergers project and the bell fell under the aegis and jurisdiction of the waffen ss and there are strong indicators that both projects were part of ss obergruppenfuehrer hans kammlers super secret black projects empire most people dont know it but one aspect of kammlers black projects empire was its coordination via a think tank of scientists that he recruited for these projects this department actually published and circulated its own top secret journal of their scientific papers to each other in other words these scientists were expected to brainstorm and think outside the box and to map out the technologies trees necessary to bring various technologies to fruition i believe that this is precisely what we see with the various nazi saucer projects what were seeing is not absence of coordination or an inefficient duplication of effort but rather the steps in a technology tree that had been worked out towards the acquisition of field propulsion machines

15842 these new clips demonstrate the original mock up but with aluminium sleeves on the rollers which increases the electron flow and the magnetic effect such that with just an exciter voltage of 1 5 volts we are able to spin the rollers at 200 rpm without them flying off the ring in the first new video you will notice that once the rollers are up to speed they run at equal distance from each other the demonstration shows the gradual application of the 1 5 volts and then the gradual reduction to 0 volts in the second video one potential new investor is examining the demonstration
15843 throughout the evolution of the seg many contributors from many walks of life have provided their insights thoughts and knowledge i suspect that this is why a breakthrough was achieved in the 1960s and 1970s and the invention improved and fine tuned right up to the present day i have no doubt john will eventually be recognised along with einstein marconi tesla etc johns work has been made possible by the input of many contributors from all walks of life and correspondence is welcomed from anyone interested in this science in the coming year we hope to complete the first redesigned seg the current demonstration is being sent to the uk for patent application and as soon as the new magnetic layer is machined and magnetised we will be ready for another dynamic demonstration

15953 margerrison do you believe in life on other planets edgar mitchell oh yes there is not much question at all but there is life throughout the universe were not alone in the universe at all margerrison youre convinced were not alone in the universe mitchell oh i know for sure were not alone in the universe now have we been able to identify for sure where the other inhabited planets are no we havent certainly not in our solar system but they have identified quite a number of planets now that very likely could be life bearing planets i happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet and the ufo phenomenon is real although it has been covered up by our governments for quite a long time margerrison whoa well hang on a minute this is big all this is quite a shock to me mitchell well im sorry you havent been reading the papers recently its starting to open up quite a bit margerrison so youre telling me theres a lot of information here to take on board hang on a minute listen ive heard crazy ufo nuts tell me this kind of thing before ive never had dr ed mitchell the sixth man to walk on the moon a respected scientist in his own right announce to me that weve been visited by aliens from other planets and that they definitely are out there there is no debating it mitchell well this is the first time youve ever talked to me or i would have told you about it before margerrison laughs so you believe the whole deal mitchell theres more nonsense out there about this than there is real knowledge but it is a real phenomenon and there are a few of us who know its been covered up by all our governments for the last 60 years or so but slowly its leaked out and some of us are privileged to have been briefed on some of it i happen to have grown up in roswell new mexico where presumably the roswell incident of 1947 took place and im quite knowledgeable about it there since i grew up there but ive also been in military circles and intelligence circles that know below the surface of what has been public knowledge that yes we have been visited margerrison and youre serious youre not going to go i was just pulling your leg about that that its not true im wondering if ive stumbled upon astronaut humor and in a couple of minutes youre going to go i was only pulling your leg margerrison wow so youve been briefed on the fact that weve been visited mitchell well briefed is one word for it i have been involved in much of this work its not my main work its not my main interest but ive been deeply involved in certain committees and research programs with very credible scientists and various intelligence people that do know the real inside story and i am not hesitant to talk about it margerrison what is the real inside story mitchell thats what im telling you we have been visited margerrison is it regular contact or one crash or mitchell well no there is quite a bit of contact going on i cant tell you because i dont know all the extent of it not all of the inside details because that is not my really main interest but the fact that we have been visited that the july 1947 roswell crash is real and a number of other contacts have been real and ongoing is pretty well known to those of us who have been briefed and been close to the subject matter margerrison so why is it being covered up then why is it not mainstream mitchell the reason for that goes back to when the main instances started taking place after world war ii when in the united states at least i cant speak for the european governments or south american governments all of them recently have started opening their files this has started to open up and the internet or look at some of the international press youll start to get the stories that are coming out now margerrison but ive had people on the show telling me that governments are mounting towards disclosure towards saying this is the case do you think it will be the case that there will be an actual disclosure on this maybe this year that the governments mitchell i dont know whether it will be this year in the united states but certainly weve already had it in the last few years from the belgium government from the french government from the brazilian government the mexican government theyve opened their ufo files and admitted they had the files margerrison ok let me get my head together listen heres what i know ive had people on the show talking about the fact that the catholic church has said that belief in life on other planets does not compromise your catholicism mitchell of course that just happened recently in association i believe with a major release from the british government of some of the british files they were not your deepest files but they were some files released margerrison whats happening over the next four years all of the ufo files here in the u k are being released do you think its the case that we are ramping up to maybe the u k admitting mitchell i cant say how fast its going to happen but certainly the public awareness of it is increasing the public acceptance is increasing the amount of misinformation covert and actual attempts to cover up seem to be decreasing i think were headed for real disclosure by some serious organizations moving in that direction margerrison youve had a long time to think about this what do you think the impact will be on the world when it is finally mainstream news that there are alien beings from outside this planet mitchell well i think at this point its probably a whole bunch of whats new i think that certainly in the united states that well over 70 of the people now accept this as fact while they do not know all the correct story they do know there has been or accept the fact that there has been visitation and see ufos in the skies all the time that are very likely alien craft now not all of them aerial craft are i suspect that some of them are homegrown i suspect that in the past sixty years or so that there has been some back engineering of e t technologies and the creation of this type of equipment but its not nearly as sophisticated yet as what the visitors have margerrison so as part of your knowing about all this and also going public with it do you worry about your safety with this kind of stuff or mitchell oh i think those days are gone that used to be a concern among the people on the inside but i dont think they are knocking anybody off for talking any more or doing drastic things to them margerrison what do you think the intent of the aliens is is it hostile or peaceful not at all its not hostile its pretty obvious that if it were hostile we would have been gone by now mitchell we could have been gone by now margerrison wow mitchell we would have no defense if thats what their real intent was margerrison are we talking what do they look like mitchell youve seen some of the pictures the pictures that i know of some of them are these little people that look strange to us as far as i know from my professional contacts that have had contact thats pretty accurate margerrison do you think other people who were involved with the moon landings know about this mitchell some of them do but again like other people if you are interested enough to dig into it and want to know about it you can know about it cell phone musical sound margerrison listen i know you are a busy guy and i hear your phone mitchell yes people dont leave me alone the phone is ringing all the time and im here by myself margerrison this is easily one of the most significant conversations of my life unbelievable i want to thank you for joining us

16237 we continue to wrestle with the question of whether this represents a strategic shift on the part of al qaida
16238 we do know that al qaida leaders will never give up entirely on iraq but they may in the future see afghanistan or some other location yet to be determined as a place where their resources may be more effectively employed

16253 there was understandable disappointment among harry potter fans when only one copy of the tales of beedle the bard was offered to the public last december

16261 the writers damian shannon and mark swift after we had done everything said did you notice how many kills there were and we said yeah there are a lot they said actually there are 13 so the writers had figured that out

16265 my knees got pretty damaged i had some bad knee problems afterwards and it took me about four weeks to really recover from it it definitely isnt as campy as the original friday the 13th movies they were what they were for their day but when you look at them now you dont get as creeped out its a different feel i think the audiences are demanding a little bit more of horror movies now so ours is a lot of blood and guts and weapons and stuff like that
16266 ive been doing the character background the victimization of jason since he was abused as a child he was always the outcast
16267 he was always shunned by society so ive taken the stance that its almost like a vietnam flashback where someone has been victimized and abused so badly that when things resurface and these kids start to encroach on his area he is once again having a flashback its a moment so intense that hes getting his revenge for when he saw his mother get murdered hes still in the moment like these people just recently murdered his mother and hes having his revenge

16286 im going upstairs to my bedroom and if you want one last wild fling just come up and get me
16287 we are very happy that you have passed our little test we couldnt ask for a better man for our daughter welcome to the family
16288 the temptation to search for glory the thing to pay is the fall of man
16289 we dont want to belong we said all along we just want to be left alone
16290 being able to put all my love of chinese culture into a fantasy like the mummy and the wildness of it that was a challenge i couldnt turn down
16291 weve taken the premise of relocating the oconnells from egypt and putting them in china which is as we all know another archaeologically rich nation a long time ago rob was a harvard major in archeology with a special interest in chinese studies so this was a passion piece for him
16292 we have an idea of what he does how he does it
16293 getting to help defeat jet li that was kind of fun jet li is someone that is a power and entity
16294 i really wanted to say hey i helped beat jet li up
16295 they would have to sew me in in that first fight every time i flipped my pantyhose were always down around my ankles
16296 just for personal reasons and you know because its miley and theyre gonna do good were gonna do good too the audience is gonna vote so well see
16297 were not gonna see it until its live so i have no idea
16298 yeah i was surprised it got so big that we had to do it somewhere like this
16299 the tension is building up and people are getting nervous were gonna smoke the audience
16300 what do you expect i mean were real people i have nothing bad to say about anybody
16301 thats definitely been the rumor and its been coming from their camp so i really cant conform that at all i positively cannot confirm that i hear that its his birthday that weekend so he might be in town but these guys youre never going to know anything until the last minute anyway thats what ive been told ive heard those same rumors and that would be really cool right but there are definitely no guarantees youll just have to settle on listening to great music
16302 tom morello man i tell you what tom morello is the real deal and you will not be disappointed
16303 well you start walking the grounds and they start loading everything in and you see sort of how your blueprints working out
16304 youve got everything from the stages to the sound and lights to your backstages your artist area your vip area your cabana area and then you get floods of friends and guests that want to come and where are you going to accommodate them and you get new areas youre putting in you always have sound issues because you have so many stages so you have to position each stage and the speakers so they dont affect that other area
16305 weve got a ton of trees in grant park and were really maximizing those trees this year
16306 aside from the music the other thing were creating here is a scene
16307 its the most important aspect of lollapalooza aside from the music and the musicians themselves it goes right to the audience and whos there people want to bop around and meet people and maybe hook up so were always looking to create social situations and social stimulations within the grounds
16308 as far as our single day ticket counts radiohead seem to have taken this year
16309 radiohead sold out first and their production is just incredible
16310 we also have nine inch nails and trent reznors production is one of the best in the world
16311 i can tell you that on the inside hes ramping up if you thought nine inch was great before and the production was great before theyre stepping it up that much more now and when jack white came in with the raconteurs the first time lots of people said it was the best act weve had i am assuming these guys have developed and evolved together so thats going to be a great rock show
16312 this year i couldnt ask for a better lineup but its going to be quite something to top 2008 we are the biggest festival in the country overflowing with 75 000 people a day so i think this year were done weve done it but next year were already speaking and planning and guess what next year looks fantastic it really is unbelievable
16313 but i mean i like everybodys verse because i think that lupe killed it kanye killed it mine was more about style than how dope the rhyme was it was really my melody that i liked more than anything thats why my vocal approach was a little different from what you would hear me do i wanted to just do something different that would look different on me
16314 the concept is based on old 80s video game graphics playing behind us while were rhyming
16315 we just want to have fun with the project in a day and age where the record industry is what it is im lucky enough to be on a label that understands and theyll just let us have fun
16316 all the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
16317 we think that everyone nose in its current form already hits a certain demographic a certain way so i just wanted to go and do something different
16318 on december 1st of 1981 where were emmett and rosalie that night at dinner
16319 get out and vote or the end will be near
16320 the world is ready for change because obama is here
16321 any chair unless hes paralyzed yeah i said it cause bush is mentally handicapped
16322 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to this song is not only outrageously offensive to senator clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
16323 i heard about his skills when he was doing his thing in chicago i definitely heard some rumors that he was going to run but i just wanted to feel his vibe man hes real down to earth his energy is great hes just an honest dude and hes all about change im all for change im just pro obama i dont think theres anybody better who can be put in that office right now besides that man

16405 hai manusia telah dibuat perumpamaan maka dengarkanlah olehmu perumpamaan itu sesungguhnya segala yang kamu seru selain allah sekali kali tidak dapat menciptakan seekor lalat pun walaupun mereka bersatu untuk menciptakannya dan jika lalat itu merampas sesuatu dari mereka tiadalah mereka dapat merebutnya kembali dari lalat itu amat lemahlah yang menyembah dan amat lemah pulalah yang disembah
16406 dibuatnya permisalan dengan seekor lalat itu merupakan sesuatu yang baik dalam bahasa arab karena dapat lebih mendekatkan kepada pemahaman
16407 jika lalat terjatuh di minuman salah seorang di antara kamu maka benamkanlah ia kemudian lepaskanlah buanglah karena pada salah satu sayapnya terdapat penyakit dan pada sayap yang lainnya terdapat obat penawar
16408 ketiga tidak benar kalau dikatakan bahwa dunia kedokteran belum pernah mengadakan pengobatan suatu penyakit dengan menggunakan lalat lalat pernah digunakan sebagai obat bagi penyakit borok menahun dan paru frambosia tropica yang terjadi pada 30 tahun pertama abad ke 20 sebelum struktur kimia sulfa ditemukan untuk keperluan itu lalat dipelihara secara khusus penemuan membuktikan bahwa lalat mengandung virus pembunuh kuman bakterial dari penelitian itu ditemukan bahwa lalat di samping membawa kuman kuman penyakit ia juga membawa bakterial yang membunuh kuman kuman penelitian ini terhenti karena di saat yang bersamaan ditemukan struktur kimia sulfa keempat hadits tentang lalat menginformasikan adanya sejenis racun pada lalat kenyataan ini baru ditemukan oleh ilmu pengetahuan modern dua abad belakangan sebelumnya bisa jadi orang tidak mempercayai kebenaran hadits tentang lalat ini jika sudah ditemukan bahwa lalat selain membawa penyakit ia juga mengandung bakterial pembunuh kuman maka ada beberapa hal yang perlu diketahui tidak benar kuman yang dibawa lalat berbahaya dan menyebabkan berbagai penyakit tidak benar banyaknya kuman yang dibawa oleh lalat cukup untuk menimbulkan penyakit bagi orang yang menelan kuman itu tidak benar tubuh manusia dapat terhindar sama sekali dari semua kuman berbahaya kalau seandainya begitu justeru itulah yang sangat berbahaya bagi manusia sebab jika tubuh manusia berulang ulang kemasukan kuman yang berbahaya dalam jumlah sedikit maka kuman akan menjadi daya tahan terhadap kuman kuman sejenisnya hadits tersebut memberikan informasi penting adanya kuman pada lalat yang berlawanan dengan racun yang dibawanya ini membuktikan bahwa bakteri virus dan kuman sejenisnya saling berperang dan saling mematikan yang satu membunuh yang lain dengan jalan mengeluarkan zat beracun zat beracun ini yang kemudian digunakan sebagai bahan pengobatan yang lazim disebut antibiotika seperti penicilin dan cloromicitin dan ini bukan saja ada pada lalat hampir semua binatang berbisa ternyata bisanya itu malah menjadi penyembuh jika dijadikan sebagai obat segala sesuatu yang belum ditemukan dan belum diteliti oleh ilmu pengetahuan jangan diramalkan tetapi penelitian harus dilakukan selengkap dan sesempurna mungkin dan tidak boleh dihentikan oleh karena itu merupakan tindakan yang salah jika tergesa gesa menilai ketidakrasionalan hadits tentang lalat ini tanpa bukti dari hasil penelitian ilmiah modern

16433 if someone with an insecure attachment manages somehow to marry someone with secure attachment then after about five years or so research shows that there s a shift in their attachment pattern to a more secure profile
16434 our theories of human behavior split into largely independent systems of thought psychology and social science we rarely explore the interaction between each unique human actor and the social systems of which she or he is part yet surely this interaction ought to be at the foundation of any theory of human behavior how can we begin to understand ourselves except as creatures of the societies from which we learned the language itself to think about ourselves and how can we understand society except as a network of patterns of relationship which each of us is constantly engaged in creating reproducing and changing we need a way of thinking about the interaction between unique human beings and the social relationships they form not only because our theories are crippled without it but because without it we cannot articulate clearly many of the gravest causes of social distress
16435 a narrow focus on material resources has prevented analysts from identifying the true sources of vulnerability or resilience in a population these complex situations are best explained by a composite model of human security for a society to be resilient we find that it need not necessarily be rich
16436 individuals and communities have greater resilience when their core attachments to home community and the future remain intact

16448 big names are getting into comics and theyre bringing their fan bases with them
16449 almost all guys in their early 20s up to their 40s

16454 the big thing is that it can really wear on your body if youre not used to it
16455 as you know we have our proposed policy out there it had come to our attention that some companies simply were not following the letter of the law
16456 for safetys sake and for the integrity of the system we just cant let that happen
16457 im sure no one in this crowd is involved in that but it does circumvent the safeguards that are built into the system when we say 51 of the plane must be put together by hand and not by the kit maker that is what it is all about as eaa president tom mentioned our regulations have essentially remained unchanged for 50 years
16458 the aim of the policy change is not to punish folks
16459 it goes back to the integrity of the system as well as being able to continue to support and encourage the homebuilt industry which has been a tremendous innovator that has had a spillover effect to other parts of the industry
16460 the trends unfortunately are increasing both in terms of accident numbers and in rates
16461 we have a partnership with tom and eaa to help bring these down
16462 the one area where i do believe we do need to do better on is runway safety
16463 ga general aviation pilot deviations continue to be the primary source of runway incursions and what is disturbing for me as a pilot is the number of controller instruction read back issues the pilot is told to hold short of a runway the pilot reads back the instruction correctly but proceeds to enter the runway anyway its something that is just extremely frustrating
16464 one thing this does point out is that human factors will always continue to be an issue in aviation

16467 i think the data at this stage in the united states are not suggesting recession
16468 were right on the brink and i would be more surprised if we didnt have a recession than if we did given the financial state
16469 at this stage i think they are the major reason why in the very short term were fending off inflationary pressures
16470 that is a fiscal policy operation essentially something that should have been set up in the treasury department
16471 what we should not do is have the central bank involved in its balance sheet
16472 that balance sheet is the creator of the monetary base and if you allow major fluctuations in that base as a result of other than monetary policy reasons i think youre taking undue risks with the notion of the stability of the financial system and very specifically the feds control of inflation

16575 if you go to the western front and the battlefields and ive seen a little bit of them over the years our obligation over time has been to honour the individuals where you can do that

16634 what i said was that i know that the hague does not have a death penalty but if anybody deserves the death penalty its radovan karadzic because he was responsible directly or indirectly for 300 000 deaths
16635 so if he is still afraid of me while he is in a well padded cell in the hague i guess thats an indirect compliment in a way
16636 according to which i had to withdraw from public life i had to make certain gestures and in return the united states would fulfill their commitment
16637 this is an old charge that karadzic started in 1996

16723 when people know we can run the ball they are going to have to stop focusing on only stopping me and calvin
16724 this is going to open a lot of things up for roy and me
16725 when we start running the ball people have to put more people into the box that means we get one on one coverage on the outside and thats when good things start to happen
16726 people have to understand that he was only playing at 60 or 70 percent last year
16727 things have slowed down for me a lot this year
16728 the new offense helps but mainly it is just from having done all of this before that makes a huge difference
16729 if we run the ball the way we should and we dont get behind by 21 points this system should present more opportunities for roy and calvin
16730 we just cant get ourselves into predictable passing situations because thats when teams can take things away from us
16731 we might run the ball more this year but that doesnt change where our stars are

16734 i tried to sell a house one day and the guy offered me five thousand down and six months rent and so i was like okay and thats how i got into it
16735 mainly because the sub prime market is gone people who i was getting financing for 12 months ago cant get financing anymore
16736 it allows a person to get into real estate with out having to come up with money up front but i think as with any financial transaction the person needs to be concerned about the overall price not just the payments
16737 the seller is taking their home off the market in hopes that the renter will buy it but if they dont buy it they are back to square one
16738 basically i use my good credit score to get them a lower interest rate and it works out great for both of us
16739 at the time i thought it was a typo error i thought this cant be
16740 its a terrible feeling because i feel like where do i go now
16741 i would hope people wouldnt single out this kind of accident and say its because of the program but recognize that theres just an inhernet risk of accident in lots of the things we all do

16756 with a son in college and a daughter on her way i am no stranger to the impact that the cost of textbooks can have on the family budget the cost of college has significantly increased during recent years and one of the reasons for this trend is the often uncalculated cost of course textbooks
16757 this bill will help to curb the price of textbooks by ensuring information is available to students and professors so they can make more informed decisions upfront about which textbooks are available for their classes and how much they cost moreover students should not have to waste money on supplementary materials they dont need and wont use and professors should have the ability to choose the best materials for their classes rather than relying on costly bundled materials with todays vote expected to pass overwhelmingly i found it appropriate to travel back to minnesota to properly commemorate the first anniversary of the tragic i 35w bridge collapse i would have voted yes on this bill as i have previously
16758 i am very passionate about the pell grant program and have long been a strong advocate for it
16759 as an ardent supporter i have worked in bipartisan fashion to push the senate appropriations and budget committees to increase in the maximum pell grant award including work on numerous amendments which have resulted in increased aid for college students the good news is that our efforts on this bill will also raise the maximum pell grant award and help make higher education more affordable for more students

16830 hes swinging the bat very well at lexington and hes had a good season down there i had a chance to see him play a handful of games early in the season we consider him a prospect and obviously the yankees consider him a prospect also but if you have a chance to add an experienced guy like hawkins and the price of doing business is a lower level bat then it makes sense to go ahead and do something
16831 hes not going anywhere so we may as well trade him
16832 we sort of went into this period of time looking to bolster our starting rotation and get some more depth in the back end of the bullpen and we think with randy wolf and latroy hawkins weve done those things

16967 i got him from my aunt for christmas of 2005
16968 he was really loud and hyper he was nice he was a great dog
16969 we went to his house to feed hammer real quick because hes living with his girlfriend and theyre not allowed to have pets
16970 we were visiting the dog he still had the chain and everything and i would go to loosen it up and he would get out and try to run away dad told me not to do that
16971 it upsets me that he is my dog and then i trusted my dad with the dog and he neglects it and abuses it its not right i havent gotten to talk with him about it yet but im still really upset about it and i wish he wouldnt have done it
16972 then its up to the courts to decide what happens to him
16973 i think if hes going to do that to my dog then he should get punished for it because its not right
16974 you have to learn your lesson but then he is my dad
16975 ive just lived a little bit too colourful a life

16986 im happy for him but i hate to see him go because he was really the heart of the team
16987 i would say it helps the white sox but at the same time it hurts the reds
16988 i hate to see him leave i think he belongs in cincinnati
16989 if he has a choice he needs to stay in cincinnati
16990 i feel like the cincinnati fans have done griffey wrong over the years
16991 i think its probably a better opportunity for him but theres that sense of loyalty that well miss a bit
16992 i think it will still sell so im not going to give up on griffey sales
16993 its a bad thing for our team but its a good thing for his career
16994 if i was going to trade somebody it wouldnt be him
16995 i think hes been good for the team i think hes put a lot of fans in the ball park
16996 hes been a positive impact to the community and i myself kind of hate to see him go
16997 science and technology is the future of africa if you look everywhere countries that have managed to make a leap have depended on having innovation and applying that innovation to solve their problems one of the most serious things that have kept us in poverty is the lack of science and technology base lack of excellence in our work
16998 for the first time it has been decided by all these international supporters and the diaspora of africa professors have come together to say we have to put forward this to create a base for our young people to solve this problem and have innovations that can lift us out of poverty
16999 it is innovation that led people to discover applications for the computers its innovation that led to green revolutions its innovation that has led to so many things that have lifted so many people out of poverty

17016 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck rick davis mr mccain s campaign manager said in a statement it s divisive negative shameful and wrong
17017 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me mr
17018 is he too presumptuous is he trying too hard to be a rock star
17019 hes not patriotic hes a gentleman of color he doesnt look like the great men on the paper money
17020 newly aggressive effort to define mr obama as arrogant out of touch and unprepared for the presidency
17021 race man how barack obama played the race card and blamed hillary clinton
17022 it s divisive negative shameful and wrong rick davis mr mccain campaign s manager said
17023 theyr etrying to scare you that i dont look like the other guys on american bills
17024 so who cares what we did to get here we won
17025 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
17026 he doesnt look like those other presidents on those dollar bills
17027 prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are are accustomed
17028 elect us and well make sure the rich get much richer and tough luck to the rest of you well see to it that the constitution doesnt apply to the mucky mucks in our party and come to think of it why do we even need a constitution well invent a war and send your kids not ours to be killed and maimed in it well appoint only our most unqualified friends to key cabinet posts and then well tell em what a great job theyre doing when they screw up
17029 trying to tar him as arrogant out of touch and unprepared for the presidency
17030 i dont think barack obama will look like any other president on any of our paper currency
17031 1984 that it is always best to use the biggest lie possible
17032 by making the accusation that mr obama was playing the race card mr mccain s campaign of course was itself explicitly injecting race into its campaign against the first black man ever to become a major party s presidential nominee
17033 oh my god theyve done it again never thought mccain would stoop that low
17034 bush is an idiot and i will undo everything he has done for the last 8 years
17035 they re going to try to make you afraid of me he s young and inexperienced and he s got a funny name and did i mention he s black
17036 wow what a well rounded grounded down to earth republican he seems genuine he seems above the rest of them
17037 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue
17038 they are trying to make you afraid of me because im black
17039 i am rubber you are glue anything you say bounces off of me and sticks to you
17040 it has adopted a far more aggressive negative posture towards mr obama in recent days trying to tar him as arrogant
17041 i consistently believe that when it comes to native americans or african americans issues or reparations the most important thing for the us government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
17042 you know he doesn t look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know
17043 senator mccains campaign released a statement today but it was so dumb that we will not insult you by printing it
17044 i dont see color i know im white because the policeman calls me sir
17045 his war experience includes leading a squadron of fighter bombers into an attack on hanoi and they get shot down by antiaircraft fire all most i don t think that qualifies as good military leadership but mccain does lead the pilots heroically during their pow experience
17046 i will stand with the musulims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
17047 anyone else not even notice obama s quote you know he doesn t look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know obama president on 1 one dollar bill george washington president on 2 two dollar bill thomas jefferson president on 5 five dollar bill abraham lincoln president on 20 twenty dollar bill andrew jackson what s obama trying to say that he s not a leader and doesn t have the qualities of the other presidents only difference i can find there is that obama is black or is he trying to say something else about 3 of our founding fathers and one of the greats of the democratic party please someone enlighten me what else is different the lack of charisma in george washington the lack of truth in abraham lincoln
17048 this is a disgrace call it what it is this is blatant racism from the obama camp this must not be tolerated it s outrageous
17049 im going to raise the level of political dialog in america
17050 and im going to treat my opponents with respect and demand that they treat me with respect
17051 were going to get a dispute and a debate done but in a respectful fashion
17052 and i know how to reach across the aisle to the democrats and ill ask you to tell them to reach across the aisle to me
17053 its time we did away with a lot of this political rhetoric at the level were at including these negative ads nobody likes these negative ads you want to know what were for not who were against
17054 you know he doesn t look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know
17055 obama is quoted writing in his book from audacity of hope i will stand with the musulims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
17056 many take offence to his middle east name since 9 11 and have a simple mistrust of any thing that may be construed as a terrorist name
17057 how long did it take islam and their oil money to find a candidate for president of the united states find a candidate with close ties to the nation of islam and the violent muslim overthrow in africa a candidate who is educated among white infidel americans but hides his bitterness and anger behind a superficial toothy smile find a candidate who changes his american name of barry to the muslim name of barak hussein obama and dares anyone to question his true ties under the banner of racism nurture this candidate in an atmosphere of anti white american teaching and surround him with islamic teachers provide him with a bitter racist anti white anti american wife and supply him with muslim middle east connections and islamic monies
17058 from audacity of hope i will stand with the musulims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
17059 a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis
17060 doesn t look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
17061 obamas too bright but you really aren t paying attention to what they say anyway because they re all just a bit too pretty for their own good
17062 if you look at my record there is no evidence of this at all im sorry mr obama sees it this way its not how i feel its not something i have said and i hope we can raise the level of the game a little higher than this banter
17063 he must be racist because thats the argument i would make
17064 he doesn t look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
17065 he obama camp is feeling some heat from the advertisements point out that mr obrama has almost no experience is far far left of center
17066 and by the way they also insinuate i am black
17067 too young inexperienced arrogant and above us all certainly unexpected traits in a community organizer with the poor of chicago funny name surely a hidden muslim with a name like that etc
17068 he obama camp is feeling some heat from the advertisements point out that mr obrama has almost no experience is far far left of center
17069 obama has played the race card since day one if he hadn t been he would refer to himself as a mulatto defined as 1 the first generation offspring of a black person and a white person 2 a person of mixed white and black ancestry by ignoring the fact that his mother was white he does a disservice to all white people but then by referring to himself as a black he automatically gets the black vote
17070 wilentz has also intervened in contemporary politics as a staunch defender of bill clinton and hillary clinton
17071 history will track you down and condemn you for your cravenness
17072 the most outrageous deployment of racial politics since the willie horton ad campaign in 1988
17073 oh look hes playing the race card thats not fair woe is me we cannot compete against the race card
17074 she won because she said she has more experience than barack well mccain has more experience than her so naturally vote mccain
17075 obama plays the truth card and the only part the mccain campaign chose to acknowledge was about race
17076 that there mans a different color hes more concerned with black issues than with you
17077 we dont let girls in for free and madonna might want her rosary back in case she reinvents her look again
17078 weve now finally touched it and tasted it from my standpoint it tastes very fine
17079 mars is giving us some surprises one is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun that has presented challenges
17080 no se me ocurri nada mejor para que me recuerdes todos los d as
17081 the packers and brett favre are continuing their discussions the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
17082 i belong to a different era i dont like it now under mmp
17083 fidelity getting better and better and in fact i think even xbox 360 games will start to look better as a result
17084 a great example of a game that shipped fairly recently that showed what you can do if you start originally on ps3 and that
17085 i think its an inspired thing to do i want to thank dan for enabling me to see another side of garfield some of the strips he chose were slappers oh i could have left that out it would have been funnier
17086 passengers get more room to stretch their legs and owners get more room for all the groceries from whole foods
17087 with airline customer satisfaction at an all time low this is not the time to consider making airplane travel even more torturous
17088 polls show the public overwhelmingly doesnt want to be subjected to people talking on their cell phones on increasingly over packed airplanes
17089 you are trying to legislate courtesy folks and that just doesnt work
17090 weve invested money spent time and now something that is better for the environment is sitting in the garage it drives me crazy
17091 this is going to have very broad very wide ramifications for the commercial prospects of the drug because theres just a lot of uncertainty here
17092 weve said all along and the fda has also stated and its clearly outlined in our label that we expect to see additional cases of pml
17093 these are the first cases weve seen since the reintroduction in the u s and approval in europe two years ago
17094 key fear factor in the market place is going to be what happens when you treat beyond two two and a half years nobody knows the answer and thats kind of scary
17095 i think youll see a general pause in the market place especially in the u s where safety has become more of a lightning rod issue in part driven by the litigious nature of our society
17096 like all australian financial services companies our result for the 2008 financial year has been affected by external factors including the global credit crunch volatile equity markets and a succession of severe weather events
17097 this is purely an accounting and timing issue which will reverse as the investments redeem or as credit spreads contract
17098 our businesses are in good shape integration is progressing well and delivering the synergies we targeted our customer base has grown and satisfaction across all brands continues to improve
17099 this assumes weather events remain within the groups normal provisioning and there is no further widening of credit spreads across the groups technical reserves portfolio
17100 when i look back at peters career hes never had the balls to challenge or make a move or actually move to get the job in circumstances where he could have got it
17101 im not saying he cant come back but the polls still say hes largely unelectable
17102 hes got a long way to go and there are a number of people in the party that have ambition
17103 people like andrew robb who is sitting quietly in the wings julie bishop even tony abbott
17104 there are plenty who will have a go at the right time so i dont think its going to be an easy passage for peter whenever and im not sure that hell ever be drafted
17105 in that sense hes going to have to move something he hasnt characteristically done in his entire career
17106 i think peters strategy has been that if he got someting he really wanted to do hed leave parliament for that but otherwise hell sit on the backbench hoping one day he can make a comeback
17107 i dont think itll be today as some of the newspapers are speculating
17108 i dont think youll have to worry about pushing brendan
17109 brendan will understand the reality of the situation if it obviously doesnt improve and thats a no brainer
17110 the portrait photograph of the girl looking at the camera is obviously jess but although the photos appear to have similarities in style and setting im confident that the girl in the topless photograph is not her
17111 the cost of operating to darwin is the highest of any airport on the entire tiger airways network
17112 this is an important point to stress combined airport and fuel costs in darwin cost more than any of the 27 airports that the airline serves across australia and asia it is just incompatible for a true low fare airline to operate to such a high cost destination
17113 what we hear from our customers is that they really want the iphone not just because its a cool device but they want to do stuff with it and i dont think thats been catered for in the market so far
17114 we heard pretty loud and clear from customers that they want data one gigabyte per month is fair but its not generous we want customers who scoff at one gigabyte to have the option to get more
17115 its odd that wireless broadband pricing seems to be different to mobile data pricing and so were shooting to rectify that
17116 i think as customers become more savvy they will start to realise that data over a network is just data over a network regardless of the device used
17117 the one national gay amp lesbian archives houses the worlds largest research library on gay lesbian bisexual and transgendered heritage and concerns
17118 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy sitting next to him repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
17119 when he was attacking him he was calm it was like he was at the beach
17120 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
17121 he went back to his seat and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it to us like that and then dropped it on the ground in front of us
17122 the incident was very tragic but was an isolated event
17123 bus travel has been and remains the safest mode of travel in the country
17124 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare
17125 certainly the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
17126 i think the tsa should leave it up to professional trained security people and not up to the pilots
17127 those are the exact reasons on why i dont think they should carry guns because situations like that could happen
17128 there is always a risk of someone getting hold of a badge or identification its the same thing with a police officer i still think they need to protect the passenger on those planes
17129 solutions and services faces a hard time trying to meet its target for the full financial year having achieved an ebit margin of only 2 6 for the first nine months of the year
17130 given that the eu only yesterday reported a slump in its well respected indicator of the economic climate for the euro zone revenue growth in 4q for sis and indeed the rest of siemens whose business is still heavily reliant on europe will be an even tougher challenge
17131 introduced more far reaching changes that are bound to uproot the companys culture a culture which has been woven over 160 years
17132 as a result there are potentially millions of files containing sensitive or confidential data that may be accessible to a large number of airport employees and contractors
17133 i dont think any governor wants to be in this situation
17134 barack obama explorou o fator racial algo que divide negativo vergonhoso e errado
17135 barack obama n o acredita de forma alguma que a campanha de mccain esteja utilizando a ra a como um fator mas sim cr que est o utilizando os mesmos velhos truques pol ticos de sempre para distrair os eleitores dos verdadeiros assuntos nesta campanha
17136 n o se parece com todos os outros presidentes que aparecem nas notas de d lar

17173 well those are military men and my church is different
17174 the whole industry has been doing really quite well but it has grown so fast over the last couple of years that returns are starting to drop pretty sharply
17175 all of a sudden therell just be too many blueberries one year and they wont be worth anything
17176 weve had the best of both worlds increasing supply and increasing pricing really driven by the whole health interest in blueberries
17177 we have to continue to keep supply and demand in balance for the blueberry growers
17178 a lot of people who traditionally buy from growers theyre not committing and its creating a lot of uncertainty in the market
17179 this industry was due for a tremendous growing pain and i think this year is the first year of the effects of that its due to the success of the crop farmers do jump on each others bandwagons when theres a successful crop
17180 how long it will last will depend on whether the average consumer can continue to afford our crop
17181 in preparation for china coming on strong we want to try to keep their fruit in their own country
17182 its a backdoor way to do it but a necessary one we think

17191 in this case it led them right to a robbery
17192 youd be surprised how many criminals want to brag about what theyve done
17193 a robbery has just occurred at the starbucks so they knew what they had done
17194 the officers didnt actually see the robbery they just saw them enter and leave
17195 well this investigations ongoing as far as how many robberies theyve committed we know that theyre probably linked to a couple others
17196 all that leads to is us catching them thats all it is is just tips for us so thank you by the way we can thank them for doing that

17427 hes got a dog a doberman pinscher named belle every day he takes belle for a walk in the morning and nearly every morning his neighbor leans out her window or peeks out her door and yells at him shes convinced that his dog is pooping on her lawn now i know my son in law he may not be much of a husband but he takes better care of that dog than he does himself and he always has a plastic bag or three with him to pick up after her
17428 last weekend dave had just about had enough of his neighbor for one lifetime so he figures hes going to do something about it he gets up at about four a m and goes to the kitchen for a jar of skippy out he creeps onto her lawn and leaves a big dollop of peanut butter on the grass then goes back to bed
17429 at his usual time dave takes belle out for a walk and deliberately cuts across his neighbors lawn which brings her out on the front porch shouting at him that his dog left another mess in her yard
17430 dave says the neighbor hasnt so much as looked at him since
17431 fanfiction existed before the internet so its entirely possible nadia would be writing it even without the computer what she wouldnt have is the community that the internet brings
17432 the absolutely true diary of a part time indian was last years big ya book what i find so fascinating about that situation is that alexie published another book last year with a teenage main character a wonderful unique magical book called flight flight however was published as an adult book whats going on here
17433 even the most timorous teenage girl couldnt conceive of bella as intimidating its hard to imagine a person more insecure or a situation better set up to magnify her insecurities

17439 weve been able to come up with a java applet that for all intents and purposes is an image
17440 the attack is going to work best wherever you leave yourself logged in for long periods of time
17441 there will be other ways to do this with other technologies
17442 in the long term web applications are going to have to take control of the content
17443 its a web application issue the java attack that were currently using is just one vector

17447 there is a lot of anger and discontent among shareholders it will be lively tomorrow
17448 the meeting will be an opportunity for us to speak up and make our voices heard if youre in the bay area i encourage you to come out hopefully well have a lively set of questions posed to the yahoo board in a true direct fashion
17449 i dont think theyll be able to execute on all of them
17450 its a cool bold visionary project but it will be hard to do
17451 he certainly thought it was a worthwhile venture venture and that it was needed in the community and i felt very encouraged with the conversation that we had
17452 it is also close to a creek and any accidental releases of anything if they get into the creek weve got a problem there and it is very close to moranbah thats the other concern
17453 theres definitely been steady increase with tv sales plasmas and lcds
17454 i guess the prices of tvs have come down a little into a more affordable price range and i guess over the last 7 months since weve been open ive seen substantial growth in that area
17455 were ramping up to the busy time of the year leading into christmas weve got fathers day ahead of us
17456 household goods have been performing well there are other sectors that havent been
17457 we are alert to the fact that it can have some effect
17458 theyve chosen to move away from this particular site but it may be that there may be another site somewhere for example powranna that this group may entertain looking at
17459 obviously theyll have to go through all the environmental hoops and all the planning processes as this last proposal has done
17460 let us be silent that we may hear the whisper of god
17461 god loves you and thats all you need to remember now
17462 because i know on a plane im not in control
17463 you may not see it as easily now but this is the man i am
17464 we accept the verdict and respect the jurys decision and now well move on to the sentencing part of the case

17466 if you are not prepared to invest an additional five cents in road reconstruction bridge reconstruction then god help you you dont have a sense of the future
17467 i think all options should be on the table and im willing to at least consider a gas tax increase
17468 the dfl caucuses in minnesota took a bucket of tax increases and dumped it on the heads of minnesotans
17469 we need to step up take accountability for mistakes that have been made and show the people of minnesota their tax dollars will be represented by leaders
17470 this collapse should not be viewed as an isolated event it should be viewed as symptomatic of an aging infrastructure of our highway and bridge system
17471 safety is not just being able to drive across a bridge but its also about being able to drive under a bridge and not feel threatened
17472 i think the banks will be under huge pressure in the market place to act in response to official interest rate changes
17473 operating in the market these banks have a responsibility to act despite recent adjustments both by the nab and by anz in response to some bad decisions lending decisions made in the past
17474 look at the overall profitability levels of our banks they are huge therefore i believe they have got a responsibility to pass on
17475 people have said to me from the day that i took this job they said look its the worst job in australia in politics
17476 but if i listened to commentators instead of doing what i think is right then id be losing objectivity
17477 i am absolutely determined with everything ive ever done in my life to see it through and i will lead us through to the next election
17478 every new governor general has the right to decide who her or his official secretary should be
17479 we believe that when it comes to budget policy we have done the right thing it is the right course of action
17480 and as i said a 22 billion surplus is the best way you can position this economy going forward it gives you a buffer for the future
17481 the big challenge is as you know getting the balance right between not having an economy which is plagued by high levels of inflation forcing interest rates up over the long term while at the same time ensuring enough activity continues to be generated in the economy
17482 we have got our fiscal settings as right as we can but it is going to be tough tough in the sense of the impact on peoples family budgets
17483 look at the overall profitability levels of our banks they are huge therefore i believe they have got a responsibility to pass on
17484 we have had inflation running at 16 year highs as of when we came into office that then flows into interest rates and we have had 12 of those on the trot going up
17485 that then affects the level of activity in the economy and that in turn affects ultimately employment but when it comes to the statistics provided by the abs australian bureau of statistics it is not appropriate for politicians or prime ministers to speculate on future data
17486 the bottom line is we have an impact on the global economy flowing through to australia from the credit crisis coming out of the us sub prime
17487 we have had the further shock to the economy coming off the back of the global oil shock the biggest that weve seen since the 1970s
17488 the key challenge is that we have a course a pathway through this and thats got to be built on a strong approach to budget policy and a strong approach to long term economic reform so that we can come through this in better shape
17489 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
17490 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
17491 that doesnt sound like much but it is to our guys its huge
17492 the most amazing thing is these guys come here in crisis they have low self esteem and they are scared who wouldnt be and i see them grow and change its amazing
17493 the guys decided to give 25 percent of what they raise to the food bank
17494 its up to them what to spend the money on their doing things for the guys that will come after them thats great thats community
17495 sometimes they just need help finding a place to live or accessing employment opportunities
17496 were informal like a home we have an open door policy theres rules and structure but its like a family
17497 anything you write you never wrote before old stuff doesnt help you just have to trudge your little road
17498 will he admit he loves me being that were married and humping like bunnies
17499 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
17500 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
17501 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
17502 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
17503 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
17504 seriously guys no matter how dark my sense of humor is i can assure you that i will never post fucked up shit like dismembered baby feet to make you laugh because

17511 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
17512 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
17513 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
17514 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
17515 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
17516 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
17517 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
17518 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
17519 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
17520 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
17521 who are open to doing something on the production side
17522 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
17523 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
17524 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

17541 this years crop of peanuts has been in the ground for weeks and 2008 production contracts were signed months ago changing the loan differential formula after the peanut crop has been planted would have been detrimental for our growers domestic demand for peanuts and peanut products has increased and the federal government should allow growers to respond to this demand without interrupting current systems in place i applaud usda for recognizing the importance of maintaining the historically recognized practice of establishing loan differentials for the 2008 crop year
17542 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
17543 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
17544 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
17545 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
17546 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
17547 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
17548 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
17549 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
17550 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
17551 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
17552 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
17553 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
17554 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
17555 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
17556 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
17557 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
17558 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
17559 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
17560 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
17561 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
17562 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
17563 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
17564 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
17565 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
17566 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
17567 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
17568 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
17569 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
17570 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
17571 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
17572 one of the reasons i chose to write this piece for nr is that ive been immersed in foreign languages for much of my life have thought a lot about them cherish them i think ive studied five languages formally and maybe the same number informally im sort of a language junkie therefore i have some confidence in pushing back against the obama types
17573 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
17574 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
17575 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
17576 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
17577 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
17578 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
17579 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
17580 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
17581 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
17582 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
17583 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
17584 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
17585 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
17586 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
17587 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
17588 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
17589 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
17590 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
17591 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
17592 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
17593 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
17594 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
17595 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
17596 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
17597 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
17598 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
17599 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
17600 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
17601 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
17602 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
17603 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
17604 dont you give it back no matter what even if i beg and plead

17896 this reshuffle is the first opportunity to show fukuda colour
17897 the biggest question is whether he can clarify his policy objectives and create a set up to face the next general election
17898 this is an old charge that karadzic started in 1996
17899 such a deal would have been immoral and unethical it obviously didnt happen
17900 ambassador holbrooke and we have repeatedly made clear that no agreement was ever made in which radovan karadzic was provided immunity from prosecution or arrest
17901 and in order to explain this to his own people he put the story out then and he has embroidered it over 12 years but there is zero truth to it i have testified to that account
17902 if holbrooke still wants my death and regrets there is no death sentence at this court i want to know if his arm is long enough to reach me here
17903 what i said was that i know that the hague does not have a death penalty but if anybody deserves the death penalty its radovan karadzic because he was responsible directly or indirectly for 300 000 deaths
17904 in front of the anti doping prosecutor i took responsibility for my actions
17905 before the tour i made a mistake i took the substance that you all know about epo
17906 hopefully i will go out and shoot an even better round tomorrow
17907 it just seems that i cannot put 18 holes together
17908 its just so disappointing that i dont seem to be able to pull it together
17909 our very brand is based on people being safe accordingly your government will not tolerate any action that will tarnish our country
17910 to any small island developing state this figure is astronomically high these criminal deportees with skills developed and nurtured in the us and the uk are impacting tremendously on our society
17911 thats a big mistake in my opinion for the tour
17912 if you saw the players how many injuries the players have in the last months you have to consider if we are going in the good way a good direction or not
17913 not everyone has the same injuries but i see a lot of players with problems in the knees and the feet everybody is taped you have to tape its very tough this surface
17914 i played a lot of matches in the last months too many i think
17915 this year im playing my best season not on hard but on every surface im confident for that reason i feel a little bit of a better player
17916 the top management of atp are always thinking about playing more and more tournaments on this kind of surface i think its not a good way
17917 the story is set in a future where identity theft leads to victims having their minds erased and replaced by those of the elderly rich seeking a second youth or by criminals and terrorists with more sinister motives a team of special agents known as reapers are formed to track down and terminate those responsible
17918 its rare for us to sign up to a project based on just a proposal but the opportunity to work with proven talent like pat and clint from such an early stage on a project with so much potential was just too good to pass up

17991 weve been able to come up with a java applet that for all intents and purposes is an image
17992 the attack is going to work best wherever you leave yourself logged in for long periods of time
17993 there will be other ways to do this with other technologies
17994 in the long term web applications are going to have to take control of the content
17995 its a web application issue the java attack that were currently using is just one vector
17996 its that browser security is broken browser security is really an oxymoron
17997 as with any program there are tricks you can do to make programs run better
17998 the goal is to deliver improvements in performance and enable the thousands of facebook servers to deliver the greatest overall value and price performance
17999 when you look at what intel does with processors most deals and investments are with an eye to grow the market
18000 one of the things that has happened in the server business with the advent of a bigger internet mega datacenters have turned into a growth market for higher end server components

18005 you have good lawyers putting their time in on the case and in a policy sense they are achieving something says ann bartow an associate professor at the university of south carolina school of law
18006 but in a victim sense assuming you think of the women as victims its not clear what this is going to achieve
18007 we have never had such a way to lie and distort facts about people to spread lies and distortions in a way that is attached to them
18008 and you can game it to come up on the front page of google
18009 the internet isnt a radical free zone where you can hurt people but on the other hand we cant have everyone rushing to the court because the court is a blunt tool
18010 we need something to help shape norms there needs to be some kind of push back against the notion that the internet is a place where you can say what you want and screw the consequences thats not what free speech is about
18011 we dont have any middle ground dispute resolution processes in society anymore and courts arent a good way to vindicate these non monetary harms
18012 i think you run the risk of too much take down
18013 i think you need procedural hurdles in place since we are talking about a constitutional right
18014 as an attorney i found it really offensive that ciolli was being held hostage to these peoples demands on a third party
18015 part of reason people were so upset with anthony ciolli was that they believe he stuck to his guns and defended things on free speech grounds
18016 nobody understands me so why should i try to understand them

18022 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
18023 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
18024 the scientific community is really going to run with this
18025 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science

18035 there are always hot spots but they are always moving
18036 hot spots are dynamic entities you can predict the location by looking at climate and tectonics
18037 the areas that are most diverse are not the warmest areas

18049 we express our strong discontent and firm opposition to the resolution which linked such irrelevant issues as human rights religious freedom sudans darfur issue and the myanmar issue with the beijing olympics and criticized the chinese government groundlessly
18050 the passing of the resolution at this time has fully exposed the attempt of the very few anti china us lawmakers to politicize the olympics and their evil intention to disrupt and sabotage the beijing olympic games
18051 such a deed has violated the olympic spirit and aim and also violated the common wish of the world people including the us people
18052 we have the confidence and ability to make the beijing olympic games a world sports event with distinctive characteristics and a high level the attempt of the us congress anti china forces will gain no popularity and be doomed to failure

18076 their intention was to attack what the hebrew university stands for one of the most remarkable symbols of revival of the jewish people they tried to uproot the wonderful achievements of study and research they wanted to taint the atmosphere of this campus to weaken our commitment to development pluralism tolerance and aspiration for peace

18093 way to exit the vehicle you panzies sic yesterday when someone opened up shop with a 12 guauge sic shotgun in the pennsylvania he got rushed by multiple people as he was still firing shots
18094 37 people didnt have anything to throw at him 37 people couldnt have over powered one guy with a knife
18095 isnt this the same mentality that allowed 2 or 3 idiots with box cutters to take out the twin towers
18096 they all watched and the bus driver had to ask a trucker to help him keep the guy in the bus
18097 no handguns allowed in canada we know but no woman had a purse to bonk him on the head
18098 no one bothered to throw a can of diet coke at the guys head who was on the bus the old ladies home and gardening society
18099 winnipeg is only a few miles from the u s border
18100 the idea was to get as close to the u s as he could if not get into the u s then engage in the attack in front of a busload of people this was another act of radical islamic terrorism on north american soil

18103 it was a politically motivated action to disrupt anwar s political career
18104 any attempts to delay the by election which must be held within 60 days after the election commission is notified or to arrest him or charge him in court will be seen by his supporters as a form of victimisation
18105 also he is already scheduled to address the people in permatang pauh this saturday its a well thought plan to pre empt bns efforts to derail his political agenda
18106 im not surprised if anwar can increase the number for the constituents they know they are going to vote for a prime minister
18107 it will even be better than the recent general election we have received news that the local pas leaders will begin to mobilise their election machinery to help us even dap members are excited about this

18111 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging

18114 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass
18115 the music industry is a business like any other but at the helm of this industry is a pool of artists whose work often serves as a barometer to the social and environmental challenges our society faces
18116 its a bit patronizing for us 21 year olds to try to start to change the world
18117 especially when were using enough power for 10 houses just for stage lighting itd be a bit hypocritical
18118 ill be the first to admit that the music industry has some big unavoidable emissions associated with their business
18119 with upward of 60 vehicles getting seven miles per gallon for a single national tour the impact can be pretty staggering
18120 a majority of pollution and waste associated with music tours is actually an effect of the fans themselves driving to and from shows producing waste at the shows littering in parking lots and venues using one use plastic containers for all their food and drink etc
18121 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
18122 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
18123 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
18124 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
18125 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
18126 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
18127 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
18128 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
18129 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
18130 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
18131 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
18132 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
18133 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
18134 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
18135 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
18136 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
18137 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
18138 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
18139 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
18140 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
18141 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
18142 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
18143 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
18144 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
18145 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
18146 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
18147 in 10 to 12 years we will reach the tipping point
18148 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
18149 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
18150 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
18151 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
18152 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
18153 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
18154 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
18155 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
18156 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
18157 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
18158 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
18159 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
18160 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
18161 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
18162 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
18163 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
18164 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
18165 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
18166 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
18167 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
18168 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
18169 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
18170 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
18171 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
18172 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
18173 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
18174 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
18175 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
18176 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
18177 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
18178 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
18179 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
18180 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
18181 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
18182 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
18183 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
18184 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
18185 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
18186 you know life shouldnt be hard its all about connecting and finding a reason for it
18187 how many times has she gotten me involved in things even when ive said no im not doing it
18188 its just something about jaki she has a way of talking people into doing things without them even realizing it
18189 you cant help but get sucked in shes so approachable
18190 my business is my life and im ok with that
18191 i think she would love to have a significant other an equal whos really the key person in her life
18192 she needs someone to share it with because shes accumulated so much and i dont just mean wealth
18193 integrated into a mainstream investment process in a way that enhances profitability
18194 an inconvenient truth the planetary emergency of global warming and what we can do about it
18195 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
18196 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
18197 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
18198 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
18199 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
18200 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
18201 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
18202 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
18203 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
18204 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
18205 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
18206 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
18207 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
18208 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
18209 hes the only naked man that will ever be in my bedroom
18210 its t boone pickens different political party different persuasion than al saying weve got to move to renewables
18211 the democrats want to just do the renewable energy without additional production additional supply and chalk it up as a victory
18212 distorted t boone pickens words when he said we cant drill ourselves out of this problem
18213 he didnt mean we shouldnt be drilling and finding what we can
18214 he just said we need to do all these things
18215 it helps underscore why we believe gaining grass roots support for the pickens plan has been so successful and is such an integral part going forward
18216 we found that in fish that do have temperature dependent sex determination tsd a rise in water temperature of just 1 5 degrees celsius can change the male to female ratio from 1 1 to 3 1
18217 if climate change really does result in a rise of 4 degrees which is the maximum the ipcc predicts and if species cant adapt in time or migrate then in the most sensitive cases of tsd were looking at extinction
18218 we do not have the benefits of air conditioning it is important to understand the realities of living in various parts of the world
18219 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
18220 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
18221 if only al gore had stopped with the invention of the internet instead of going on to invent global warming
18222 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
18223 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
18224 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
18225 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
18226 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
18227 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
18228 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
18229 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
18230 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
18231 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
18232 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
18233 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
18234 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
18235 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
18236 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
18237 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
18238 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
18239 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
18240 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
18241 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
18242 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
18243 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
18244 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
18245 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
18246 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
18247 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
18248 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
18249 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
18250 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
18251 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
18252 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
18253 it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
18254 its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
18255 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
18256 we cannot do the job with renewables and energy efficiency alone
18257 we have to have a balanced energy portfolio that includes all those things in even higher percentages but also has to include nuclear and we frankly think that nuclear should be increased
18258 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
18259 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
18260 its a very aggressive bold comprehensive proposal and its great to challenge the politicians to go where they need to go
18261 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
18262 i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president
18263 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on
18264 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
18265 former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
18266 we cannot do the job with renewables and energy efficiency alone we have to have a balanced energy portfolio that includes all those things in even higher percentages but also has to include nuclear and we frankly think that nuclear should be increased
18267 the vice presidents main effort is to mobilize the american people behind meaningful action and less talk about global warming
18268 its a very aggressive bold comprehensive proposal and its great to challenge the politicians to go where they need to go
18269 none of us can walk away from this issue without agreeing with him that we do have a very serious problem and its only going to get worse unless we do something about it i hope to be a part of that and i would like to see the free market take the lead not the government
18270 it pointed out that the only way we have a chance to drive down oil prices is if we become free of the slavery of oil if we can give americans choices of electrical cars or biodiesel cars then and only then do we have a chance of dealing with this cost issue that is why 4 a gallon gas is not an enemy of action its an ally of action
18271 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
18272 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
18273 in oregon one boy died and another sustained permanent brain damage after the two played with a novelty lighter shaped like a dolphin a lighter shaped like a cell phone caused second degree burns to a young boy in north carolina in arkansas a two year old and 15 month old died in a fire they accidentally started by playing with a lighter shaped like a toy motorcycle
18274 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
18275 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
18276 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
18277 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
18278 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
18279 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
18280 the best use of talents and experience i have gained in my life is to expand the political space in which these members and politicians address the climate crisis
18281 an oil man reacting to the largest transfer of wealth in history
18282 mr gores focus is primarily on solar wind and geothermal energy his belief is that a dramatic wholesale transition to these abundant and renewable sources of energy is not just doable but essential
18283 for years rep jay inslee d wash has been frustrated with congress inability to devise a clean energy policy so he decided to do something about it without markups or bills or committees he decided to write a book center for american progress inslee depicts an economic shift necessary to ease america into a clean energy revolution in the book which was released by island press on oct 1 2007
18284 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
18285 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
18286 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
18287 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
18288 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
18289 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
18290 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
18291 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
18292 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
18293 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
18294 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
18295 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
18296 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
18297 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
18298 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
18299 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
18300 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
18301 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
18302 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
18303 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
18304 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
18305 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
18306 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
18307 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
18308 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
18309 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
18310 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
18311 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
18312 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
18313 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
18314 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
18315 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
18316 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
18317 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
18318 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
18319 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
18320 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
18321 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
18322 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
18323 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
18324 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
18325 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
18326 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
18327 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
18328 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
18329 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
18330 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
18331 two canaries in the coal mine the first one is in the arctic of course the arctic ocean has a floating ice cap greenland on its side there i say canary in the coal mine because the arctic is one part of the world that is experiencing faster impact from global warming this is the largest ice shelf in the arctic the ward hunt ice shelf it just cracked in half a year ago the scientists were astonished
18332 current coastal temperatures are about 1 c below their 1940 values
18333 at the summit of the greenland ice sheet the summer average temperature has decreased at the rate of 2 2 c per decade since the beginning of the measurements in 1987
18334 colors indicate ice sheet elevation change rate in cm year from satellite altimeter data 1992 2003 the spatially averaged increase is 5 4 0 2 cm year
18335 shut off would imply repeal of the law of conservation of angular momentum widely disseminated and grossly oversimplified pictures showing the ocean as a conveyor belt have misled people into thinking ocean circulation is driven by a sinking motion at high latitudes
18336 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
18337 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
18338 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
18339 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
18340 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
18341 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
18342 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
18343 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
18344 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy

18349 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
18350 the arctic ocean is warming up icebergs are growing scarcer in some places and the seals are finding the water too hot
18351 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
18352 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
18353 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
18354 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
18355 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
18356 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate

18366 the most exciting part of the conference was at the end when i was invited to the front by the chiefs they conducted a ceremony and gave me a traditional name kayonu toe which means peace hero
18367 when our children assess what we and our generation did here in this world as they look backward they will ask one of two questions theyll look back and either they will ask what were you thinking didnt you see the glaciers melting didnt you see the deserts growing and the droughts worsening and the crops drying up didnt you see the sea level rising didnt you see the floods didnt you pay attention to what was going on didnt you care what were you thinking
18368 one which i would much prefer them to ask i want them to look back on this time and ask how did you find the moral courage to successfully address the crisis that so many said was impossible to address and when they ask that question i want you to tell them that you saw it as a privilege
18369 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
18370 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time

18380 the 12 best kept beauty secrets of the real cougar woman
18381 this is a very old story and it seems very strange to me that it ended with a suspension for our athletes
18382 and its very symptomatic that it was announced just days before the games
18383 i think that such an attitude to our athletes appeared on political reasons as their high results exasperate some of their rivals and athletics federation officials
18384 how could the samples be substituted if the dope testing procedure was strictly regulated
18385 and if everything was all right when the samples were given and it was confirmed by the protocol i think that the wada officers but not the athletes should be questioned when it was discovered that the samples were different
18386 we still have no plan how we will defend ourselves i think we shall study all the conditions of the case before taking any steps but we will not just accept this decision it definitely appeared exclusively on political reasons
18387 the iaaf has provisionally suspended seven athletes from russia for doping offences a decision which has been acknowledged by the all russia athletics federation araf
18388 the athletes have been charged for a fraudulent substitution of urine which is both a prohibited method and also a form of tampering with the doping control process

18393 race will not have any role in my campaign nor is there any place for it im disappointed that hes used it

18395 youd think wed be having a serious debate but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with
18396 our politics is small when we need to be thinking big
18397 i admire his obamas campaign but what we are talking about here is substance and not style and what were talking about is who has an agenda for the future of america campaigns are tough but i am proud of the campaign that we have run
18398 yesterday he suggested that we put air in our tires to save on gas my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on middle eastern oil i dont think so
18399 the mccain campaign has very clearly decided that the only way to win this election is to become very personal and very negative we believe that people will see that as nothing more than the same old politics and the same old policies of the last eight years
18400 im not positive of the reasons behind this past years infestation but we have invaded their territory
18401 also the heat and very little rain have probably caused them to be more active in order to find food
18402 the counselor went to look again and didnt see the boy
18403 maybe well never know if a lifeguard would have saved this person or not but it wouldnt have hurt
18404 perhaps we should have had hearings before that decision was made
18405 we dont have to be a victim and only react when its too late
18406 the mission of peace is of utmost importance we want to bring peace to their home their block and make their community safer because with violence youre locked in

18413 my client feared for his life theres no doubt about it
18414 how many times do i have to answer that question
18415 i thought it was a gun i was scared and thats what happened
18416 it was the second time i held it and the first time i fired it
18417 this is a tragedy but not for both sides as some would say
18418 hes laying in the bed he made and tykeem law is laying in the ground he put him in

18422 medicare fraud wastes taxpayer dollars hurts legitimate businesses and shrinks the important resources that should be going to care for our seniors and disabled
18423 our bill will give cms and hhs the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred from pay and chase to detect and prevent
18424 each year roughly 30 to 60 billion a year in taxpayer dollars is wasted because of medicare fraud and abuse this hurts not only taxpayers but medicare recipients and legitimate providers as a result congress should do everything in its power to eliminate fraud and abuse this legislation we are introducing moves our efforts from a pay and chase model to one that takes proactive tangible steps to stop fraud before it begins i hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important effort to protect taxpayers and medicare recipients
18425 we are going to make a big big difference in the american marketplace
18426 we are ensuring that the products that come into america are safe for consumers and that the regulating agencies have what they need to do their job
18427 toxic chemicals like lead and phthalates have no business in our childrens toys
18428 safety testing and certification for such hazards as powerful magnets before products are sold a ban on lead and phthalates and more will helpfully put an end to the recalls of childrens products and the horror stories that lead to those recalls
18429 its been a big issue online but for the most part the response weve gotten has been very positive weve got petitions a few people on forums who are very loud but its really more of the squeaky wheel syndrome
18430 certainly internally theres no doubt i would tell people who dont like the art style that probably getting the art style was the hardest thing
18431 diablo is a game you play for hopefully hundreds of hours and one of the rewards is a variety of different looking environments
18432 people remember the act i dungeons but they kind of conveniently forget the green fields of act i and all of act ii and its palaces its bright deserts
18433 we had all kinds of problems with identification of units combat wasnt very good and the worlds got homogeneous very quickly as we played through it we didnt like it or think it was very much fun
18434 theres a philosophy that goes across all of our games and that philosophy stays true from game to game so it probably draws some comparisons
18435 one philosophy is that our artists feel like if theyre just using photorealism not creating a unique look for the game not stylizing so that its uniquely blizzard then theyre not doing their jobs
18436 if you do follow those rules theres going to be some similarities
18437 we dont say oh we dont want to do anything those games did its all blizzard were all a family wow pulled stuff from diablo ii if we think its a smart choice we try to pull stuff from them we dont really worry about whether its different what matters is does it make the gameplay better that always wins
18438 diablo can do a lot of things wow cant even do
18439 we cant do the level of violence that they can do in diablo iii we would lose our rating if we do the things that diablo iii does they have a much darker vibe
18440 if were actually making the game worse with no other reason than to be different from wow then its a bad choice we dont think when people play that theyll have any problem telling that its a different game
18441 we want to generate the feeling of everything getting worse its part of our narrative it makes the more gloomy part of the game a place where the stakes get higher
18442 once its up lets equip the neighbors and the other communities to paint it over lets get it off the street lets get it off the wall lets get it off the fences as soon as we can so these guys dont get the glory of having their names and their monikers up for a long time
18443 this is one of my long days im going home after clinic

18445 what why wouldnt you want to get a free dinner
18446 cmon shell never know just come out for a nice meal the talk will only be an hour and then well all go out for drinks why wouldnt you
18447 because i dont want to whore myself out for a piece of meat thats why

18458 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
18459 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
18460 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
18461 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
18462 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
18463 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
18464 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
18465 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
18466 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

18484 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
18485 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
18486 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
18487 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
18488 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
18489 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
18490 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
18491 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
18492 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
18493 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
18494 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight

18499 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba

18501 the regional fugitive task force is a program that works with local law enforcement to take the worst of the worst criminal offenders off the street florida is experiencing an increase in violent crime and this program is a priority
18502 this additional 10 million will help to expand the task forces presence in florida
18503 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
18504 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
18505 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
18506 people just make themselves easy targets and give would be thieves way too many opportunities to take their property
18507 if youre going to park downtown or anywhere and if somebodys going to charge you money make sure they have the authority to do so
18508 it makes it harder for us whenever people come in and we try to charge them the rates were trying to charge for a special event
18509 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
18510 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
18511 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
18512 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
18513 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
18514 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
18515 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
18516 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
18517 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
18518 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
18519 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
18520 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
18521 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
18522 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
18523 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
18524 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
18525 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
18526 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
18527 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
18528 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
18529 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
18530 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
18531 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
18532 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
18533 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
18534 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
18535 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
18536 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
18537 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
18538 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
18539 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
18540 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
18541 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

18561 in our private meetings between len oren and myself it was unanimously agreed that come july 1 there would be a bomb going off a nuclear bomb for player salaries and we better shop early and often fellas or were going to be left holding the bag in a market thats undersupplied and overdemanded
18562 we had to be aggressive we finished 30th last year
18563 but id go in for the interview and everybody kept saying youre a nontraditional candidate so were putting you in this category over here
18564 i dont think there are a lot of people who could work with oren and i were owner operators
18565 were very involved and brians got the personality and whole style to be a natural fit with us hes been a 10 out of 10 so far
18566 the reality is i never saw him when i was here
18567 i called him right away and said look jay i appreciate everything youve done youre a class act but lets talk in a few weeks
18568 we had nothing we had no assets i was just floored by it quite frankly
18569 there were the fireworks on the surface that everybody saw in the malones vrbatas re signing vinny but at the same time we had to add the brandon bochenskis wyatt smiths andrew hutchinsons zenon konopkas and janne niskalas because we had no assets in the organization
18570 weve done a years worth of work in the first couple weeks
18571 weve set the table for the players nicely and now its up to them our goal is to win the division and compete for the eastern conference
18572 this particular car is the gold standard of conversion we take the engine transmission and throw it away and we redesign a much more efficient and smaller engine this engine is only 1 3 the size of a conventional the transmission is much simpler and the weight we save in the engine and the transmission we put it into batteries so this car weight the same as a conventional car and since it weights the same we projected that the costs are the same than the original car
18573 if the car companies were to do this they could build a car that would cost no more than a conventional car but they have to build at least 100 000 to 500 000 units a year
18574 our technology is much more sophisticated than the volt because the volt has no transmission and this has one and this transmission technology is our unique patented technology
18575 initial media coverage from the recent canadian g8 launch event has been highly positive
18576 we expected the powerful gt model to be popular and that was definitely the case but were particularly pleased with the high praise for the fun yet fuel efficient v6 model which will represent the majority of our volume
18577 the pontiac g8 is currently the most powerful vehicle for the dollar in the us it is faster 0 60mph than a bmw 5 series and has greater horsepower this makes it a fantastic proposition for drivers looking for style and substance that isnt going to break the bank
18578 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
18579 im disappointed that sen obama would say the things hes saying
18580 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
18581 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
18582 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
18583 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
18584 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
18585 what we are talking about here is substance and not style
18586 campaigns are tough but im proud of the campaign we have run im proud of the issues we have tried to address with the american people all i can say is we are proud of that commercial
18587 we can most assuredly tell you that voters around the country do not think theres anything substantive about this latest ad do not think its something that john mccain should be proud of
18588 i respect and admire sen obama we just have stark differences
18589 while big oil is making record profits you are paying record prices at the pump and our economy is leaving working people behind
18590 4 billion each year to the oil companies including 1 2 billion for exxon mobil alone
18591 has failed the american people on energy and that failure has led directly to our current crisis
18592 i dont think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president
18593 theres a lot of controversies that i have eagerly leapt into in my time im not so dumb that im going to jump into that one
18594 its been up and down but i wouldnt trade it for anything in the world
18595 he said if i could do it all over i wouldnt change a single thing including coming here
18596 he said i was able to put on the same uniform my dad wore for nine years
18597 i think it would help us in that on the west side we seem to not have the best image i think they still talk about the gang problems we have here

18605 roofing may be fine for 20 years because you dont have a high wind event
18606 then all of a sudden you have a high wind event then find out they didnt attach the sheeting correctly or they didnt attach attach a roof frame to the wall
18607 i dont feel any pressure im pretty confident in who i am and who my parents are i know im going to do the best i possibly can

18621 in general the farms are much better run than they were 10 15 20 years ago
18622 they are environmental nightmares and they need to be addressed
18623 its just a very sad day that were moving in the opposite direction
18624 we are at great risk of these hog lagoons overflowing rupturing
18625 lagoon systems work very well when they are managed properly and the majority of them are
18626 the farmers out here are much more in tune to those lagoons in checking them and marking sure they get those lagoons down
18627 at this point its just not economically feasible to require farms to convert from the lagoon systems
18628 i wasnt going to bother you this year in fact i tried to get into seeing the wizard of oz to make my request but the munchkins are still kind of banning me
18629 hey ms arts amp entertainment editor of regional local newspaper i just read your piece on mr local studio artist who got a major state grant to open up a gallery for local artists and i really enjoyed it
18630 christian will examine these practices their effects and provide examples where such a grass roots approach helped convince management to support or pilot fully agile approaches
18631 agile practices emerge in a collaborative environment as the leader on several projects i saw the emergence of iterative development test first evolving functional specs pair programming minimal documentation and customer involvement at every step of the way successful tools to create this environment cover creating an open environment bringing the right experience skills and thinkers together how to stimulate and foster the free flow of ideas and letting people to decide what they want to do and by when self accountability tools to lead collaboration will also be introduced
18632 we believe that if teams dont stay in the moment look below the surface at the here and now and maintain openness and wonderment they will ultimately adopt a fake agile and fail in their adoption they will kill the whole intent of agile for software teams that is they will miss the maturation and growth born of team and self inspection and adaption without judgment and without adherence to pre conceived notions of some gross level agile practices
18633 research shows culture is the single most important factor in organizational success
18634 we will reveal and discuss the essential mindset shifts a project manager must undertake to become an effective agile coach we will talk about how that leads to changes in actions and changes in conversations and decision making both within your team and with the external world we will look at the latest thinking on highly collaborative and high performing teams and consider our own actions relative to fostering such teams
18635 there are two fundamental problems with the current state of agile adoption 1 companies suck less than we did before and that is acceptable 2 most companies are blind to the game changing benefits of pursuing excellence in agile organization
18636 which is all very well but how can we get around the brittleness that has plagued automated ui tests in the past a key is to address the form in which the tests are recorded how they identify what is being done with the gui once upon a time this was the screen mechanics click on pixel 124 21 and the tests broke as soon as you ran with different monitor settings now its usually the gui toolkit mechanics find this jtable and click in the third cell of the second row but what if we ended up recording intent instead of mechanics in a domain language
18637 we all know folks who seem to be naturally creative outrageously productive somehow able to do things we cant do
18638 this session is for any agile coach or leader who is facing challenges and looking for creative ways for facing them in this practical session we hope to do two things first mine some of the hardest real world problems that attending scrum masters and other agile leaders have faced within their teams
18639 i said no ill buy it from you whats it worth well pay it
18640 its looking like a negative development i dont see why the banking sector needs to be under the purview of the public sector
18641 the private sector does a much more efficient job of running that type of business
18642 the government sees logic in expanding its network of banks in the country and santander may benefit as it has a buyer and can exit

18650 these statistics as well as the fact that all of the key carmakers including the asian oems are either already represented in russia or will be establishing their presence there shortly prompted us to make this investment

18661 the turkish republic as a democratic secular state governed by the rule of law will continue without stopping on its path toward modernity that ataturk guided it on

18668 thank you for your cooperation the money has already been transferred to your bank account enjoy
18669 you see son theres all sorts of power in the world there is the power of knowledge it can help you notice or figure out things hell the right knowledge of a person can get you whatever you want from them there is the power of fear when people show fear that means that they know your superior to them that you can hurt them that they are weaker than you thus they are afraid to hurt you because you will hurt them worse there is physical power this is linked to the power of fear because they can hurt you more than you can hurt them there is the power of perception being able to read people to know their strengths and weaknesses finally there is the most risky and dangerous power of all the power of emotions they can fuel you to do amazing things but they are also a great weakness because if you want to hurt someone very badly you can after someone they care for a great deal power is freedom if you learn how to use the forms of power i told you about then you can do whatever you want to whomever you want

18702 i would like to say that several months ago in detroit we had an investigation at which over 150 honorably discharged veterans testified to war crimes committed in southeast asia they told stories that at times they had personally raped cut off ears cut off heads taped wires from portable telephones to human genitals and turned up the power cut off limbs blown up bodies randomly shot at civilians razed villages in a fashion reminiscent of genghis khan shot cattle and dogs for fun poisoned food stocks and generally ravaged the countryside of south vietnam in addition to the normal ravage of war and the normal and very particular ravaging which is done by the applied bombing power of this country
18703 he may be a crook but he is our crook
18704 we wanted everyone to feel one culture and one set of objectives
18705 because were so distributed we had to build a common social fabric virtually
18706 we needed an architecture for content to flow in automatically and rss seemed like the best way to do that
18707 we needed something self perpetuating that fed relevant corporate information in
18708 the state of affairs was such that people were doing great work and reading good content but didnt have ways to share it
18709 we chose people who understood the technology and who realized why it had value
18710 it sounds kind of like a hokey thing to do but it does really work when the browser pops open there it is
18711 we want to hold people accountable for using the tools every day and valuing content sharing and knowledge sharing
18712 ive got strollers coming out of my ears like 24 of them does anyone want one

18716 much like kick ass the response to war heroes has taken a lot of people by surprise
18717 stores all over are reporting sell outs and are reordering as many as possible even as the initial supply is exhausted those fans from ultimates are coming to war heroes in droves so were putting even more copies out there retailers are advised to order up as our initial printing had a substantial overprint and that clearly wasnt enough for the fans
18718 its not a secret that it was disappointing not only stats wise but even to my personal standards
18719 i did some evaluating and i think i made the necessary adjustments as far as conditioning and getting myself ready to come back this year and make improvements
18720 what i learned over these last six years that ive been here is that year to year its unpredictable what happens with players and contracts and those type of things
18721 im worried about playing football right now im not even really looking forward to next season or whats going to happen after that weve got to get focused on making it happen right now
18722 i played it in college i played it in high school the times i did play defense in high school the left handed stance is my natural stance the left hand is my strong hand there are a lot more moves and power available on that side
18723 barring anything unknown theres no reason he wont go out and set records i think
18724 i was only sick for two weeks i will say during that time i lost weight a little bit of strength and probably some explosiveness and things like that
18725 i feel a little stronger i feel more powerful faster a little bigger
18726 ive got a little more weight im pleased with what i did this offseason
18727 i have a contract to play football right now after this season its a different story
18728 the armys policy is that physical training cannot be given as a punishment although soldiers in detention are required to do physical training
18729 i still think that the fear factor of a child or an animal left in here not having any choices about being able to get out or if a young infant or a child was strapped in i just think it would be very horrifying for em right now to be going through this so they have the panic that i dont have because i know i can get out but yeah its real stuffy if i didnt have this little bit of crack i know id have been out of here a long time ago
18730 its morning many mclean county farmers werent looking forward to after last nights heavy rain strong wind and in some places tennis ball size hail many new there would be a lot of crop damage to assess
18731 i had a loss a couple years ago they adjusted at 75 and it wasnt nearly as bad as this im thinking this area of the field west of the yard here is probably at least 80 or better between 80 and 100 you know so
18732 thats the case with many fields in the max garrison area reports have been any where between 3 to 5 inches of rain and wind speeds above 50 miles an hour it has many wondering what to do now
18733 everybodys in a state of wonder they want to get out there and see what everything looks like the later crops the sunflower and some of the corn that maybe got more of the rain and less of the hail this round this is going to help a little over all the crops are hurting they just dont know where theyre at yet
18734 many farmers dont have to do too much wondering as long as they have one thing insurance
18735 this year i think a good chunk of them insured with the cost of inputs that we have to put in these crops these days they couldnt afford not to insure them and insurance was up quite a bit too probably by a third this year so i hope everybody did i think everybody had pretty good coverage
18736 the fair is such a valuable financial asset now because it contributes to state revenues and as such it needs to be protected and preserved and with that that requires investment and thats what this is

18740 todays destination lies just west of three affiliated tribes museum and reconstructed earth lodge village right now were going to go inside and talk to our friend marilyn whos going to tell us a little more
18741 the museum offers a lot of information artifacts bits of history of the history and culture of the three affiliated tribes and the three affiliated tribes are the mandan hidatsa and the arikara people
18742 as you know most museums have a reputation of being a rather old place were there are just dusty relics sitting on a shelf so we try to keep pace with the progression of our tribes as well
18743 they were constructed entirely by balance so its a system of balance in keeping this very large round structure in place for probably 10 15 years what you see at the new earth lodge village up there is certainly not going to be in any sense exactly a replica of those original villages theyre going to be like i say 21st century improved
18744 participants randomized to surgical therapy were more likely to achieve remission of type 2 diabetes through greater weight loss these results need to be confirmed in a larger more diverse population and have long term efficacy assessed
18745 t he study of 60 patients showed that 73 percent of those who had the gastric banding surgery had complete remissions of diabetes meaning all signs of the disease went away by contrast the remission rate was only 13 percent in those given conventional treatment which included intensive counseling on diet and exercise for weight loss and when needed diabetes medicines like insulin metformin and other drugs
18746 the operation used in the study adjustable gastric banding is performed through small slits and loops a band around the top of the stomach to cinch it into a small pouch so that people eat less and yet feel full
18747 we dont have the agility of gymnasts the power of a weightlifter or the endurance of a marathoner but we have more agility power and endurance than any gymnast weightlifter or marathoner we do your stuff almost as good as you you cant do our stuff at all and we do stuff neither of us does way better than you can

18750 you know your legs are going to take over 2 hours because they are really big

18757 i just want to let you know that angela just told me that your sister seemed to be
18758 listen i dont know your sister but it looks like she may have been crying
18759 i think one of my clients was upset during the procedure i think she might have got upset because i told her that it might take a little longer to do her legs then what was planned
18760 i feel like this woman just did not even want to work on me from the beginning because of my weight
18761 we dont have the agility of gymnasts the power of a weightlifter or the endurance of a marathoner but we have more agility power and endurance than any gymnast weightlifter or marathoner we do your stuff almost as good as you you cant do our stuff at all and we do stuff neither of us does way better than you can

18986 the timing of the fei ruling on one fall and out gave us little opportunity to carry out the necessary research consultation and consideration which would normally precede any such change in the national rules
18987 at the time the be sport committee reluctantly felt obliged to follow the fei position and implement the ruling from august whilst carrying out its own thorough investigation of fall data accumulated since 2001
18988 having pressed on with its analysis and following further discussion with medical advisers the sport committee concluded there was no strong evidence on which to base the proposed change and will leave the current rule unchanged in national competitions thus allowing a rider to continue after a fall at a cross country fence if safe to do so
18989 i am delighted with the decision by the sport committee and board to continue under the current ruling giving our members support as they progress with the training of their horses and education of the rider from intro classes upwards
18990 every five minutes an american horse is slaughtered to fill the demand of high end european and asian diners

18993 we must treat these magnificent animals with the respect and dignity they deserve

19007 were carrying the minimum required 12 man roster and only about six of them could make it on monday because theyre working and their parents are working and cant get them there
19008 last year we made the tournament and lost in two games 25 1 and 18 6 as one of 64 teams that qualified out of 335 and going farther than ever before i take this as a successful season unfortunately we could not return with 12 players
19009 justin gordon was one of the biggest surprises this summer with his hitting
19010 hes fundamentally sound defensively but matured as a hitter he was making great contact as was andrew nelson
19011 will be a key component of the team next season
19012 im in the bullpen right now and its alright but id like to throw in games more
19013 its good i like that we play every day and they evaluate the pitchers progress
19014 the pitching coach is good he spent some time in the majors im working out in the bullpen many days and its going pretty well there
19015 we hit well played well defensively but one miscue let in the go ahead run
19016 we kept fighting and were two hits from tying mount laurel
19017 if we keep winning its six games in four days but we started three pitchers and used five of them in pool play which is a plus having a large staff
19018 bear is a good hitting team and our pitching got a little thin in that game
19019 i told the players that now they control their own destiny
19020 if we win the likelihood is that well move on
19021 i dont know who you have sitting so quietly in the two back seats but im reasonably certain that those quiet adolescents do not belong to us

19026 i talked to seven or eight former players who read the book and they all felt the same way i did
19027 its an extremely accurate portrayal anyone who thought about looking back realized it helped us we remembered lessons we learned that molded us as human beings not only in hockey but in our lives i took seriously about being on time and stayed that way to today in the work i do
19028 i read it through two sittings i couldnt put it down
19029 it amazed me when i read it how could he remember all that stuff he made you feel proud to wear that brick jersey
19030 half the time i was smiling while i was reading it and half the time i was choking with a lump in my throat
19031 i ran into former players who said they couldnt put it down
19032 it brought me back it almost brought me to tears
19033 you can laugh on one page and cry on another
19034 each kid has his own uniqueness and its up to the coach to see the strong points to focus on and to bring out of them
19035 he was a character who had his own style of coaching much like mr jim blackburn who pat patterned himself after
19036 as a kid youre so impressionable and hed give these knute rockne speeches stuff that would get players in a frenzy in the locker room that they would translate onto the ice
19037 sean oleary was the kind of kid who made coaching fun because i knew he was having the time of his life
19038 its great pat is a brick guy at heart and the book shows that its not only about winning although thats an important part
19039 it shows that great things come out of a winning tradition
19040 i have been very fortunate to have had some great coaches guide me along the way
19041 people who had the patience to teach me about the game while all the time stressing that the emphasis was always to go out and have fun
19042 he was a firm believer that good or bad if you stick to the positives and do things the right way everything will work out
19043 outstanding hes a great coach who got along so well with the boys and they had a lot of fun and it shows in the book
19044 one time coach wolf said to me pat you have an attic full of memories
19045 the more i did it the more i got into doing it
19046 grown in office as an opinion writer but it would be anathema to your wild eyed liberal posse theyd storm your office
19047 in cold blood first appeared in serial form in the new yorker
19048 the politics of fear it shows obama in muslim attire his wife toting an assault rifle a picture of osama bin laden on the wall and a flag burning in the fireplace all in the oval office
19049 just dont get it that their house organ magazine was actually satirizing hopeless red state drones for fearing obama no you cant draw pictures like that they say because people might get the wrong idea the wrong idea is never a problem when a cartoon involves republicans
19050 please in the name of all thats holy will you all just shut up
19051 i know it was the new yorkers attempt at satire
19052 but you know what its a cartoon larry and thats why weve got the first amendment and i think the american people are probably spending a little more time worrying about whats happening with the banking system and the housing market and whats happening in iraq and afghanistan than a cartoon
19053 theyre definitely interested in bringing me back well talk again in the beginning of august
19054 we have a lot of things come across the desk but when we came across this one we felt we had to do something
19055 eles disseram que n o estavam interessados em vender e eu lhes disse que quero comprar e vou fazer isso
19056 que o vendam ao governo ao estado vamos recuperar o banco da venezuela nos faz muita falta um banco dessa magnitude
19057 all structures on all lots shall be limited to one story in height
19058 we have a lot of money tied up in our properties
19059 i believe i have a problem but not to the extent that its being portrayed
19060 your testimony seems all too defensive of the existing system
19061 i would be furious if i were you id be furious if i had to answer for this staggering incompetence
19062 she goes can you come over and help me because i found a baby
19063 shes got a beautiful face honestly and she was very tranquil usually babies are fussy she was not she was a little angel
19064 i dont know what her situation is i dont know what shes going through but at least she loved that baby enough to leave it in a safe place
19065 doing the best we can to do our part to take care of the environment
19066 at the same time we know that the deities want us to take care of ourselves to stand on our own two feet as individuals as families as a community as a nation
19067 epa is bending to the will of corporate financial and misguided political interests that will pollute new mexicos skies
19068 epas decision ignores its obligations to protect the health of residents and the environment in new mexico and the region we will not allow this ill advised decision to stand
19069 it is a devastating blow to tribal members who continually suffer from the large coal complex encroaching upon our land
19070 perch so ke subito dopo ke accade una cosa brutta ne accadr una bella
19071 in those two matches the crowd was obviously against me playing a canadian a home crowd favorite its not too easy to be in this kind of atmosphere
19072 but i tried my best i wanted to be focused on myself on my game on what i have to do in order to win im pleased you know how i handled the whole situation happy to get through this match
19073 from what i see from my experience wozniak goes for it a little bit more and tends to make a lot more unforced errors dubois is more of a consistent player she moves really well its hard to make a point on her you really have to earn it
19074 there were lots of portuguese people and i think i made some new fans here
19075 i think at the end of the day seattle didnt feel as comfortable maybe going forward to finish off the trade it was just something that didnt come to fruition both parties worked hard
19076 i think at the end of the day we may have been able to get the player but it would have been at a very very steep price and i dont know if that would have helped us going forward
19077 i think were in it were relatively within striking distance in the wild card and theres still two months to play
19078 weve got to play our best baseball in these last 54 games if we want to leap frog some people
19079 we might have to bring him along a little slower in spring training but everything looked good
19080 medically no one has any concerns about rolen long term continuing to play
19081 he just will need a couple of days here and there in the course of the middle of the summer
19082 his shoulder is as strong as it could possibly be its just that it gets a little fatigued from overwork
19083 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
19084 as part of an ongoing investigation were looking for illegal substances and evidence to support the investigation
19085 please go down with signs and friends to show your support

19088 medicinal marijuana might be for you come meet with our doctor and see if you qualify
19089 this is a huge win for medical marijuana patients not only in california but across the country
19090 this ruling makes clear the ability of states to pass medical marijuana laws with an expectation that those laws will be upheld by local and state if not federal officials
19091 we work only to pay for the fuel we are not making money
19092 we ask for more but clients cannot give us more because they have no money
19093 we want the government to increase the fares so that we can feed ourselves
19094 we all agree with the strike because life has become too expensive
19095 everything is getting expensive in abidjan but our salaries do not rise
19096 we cant even eat well and now the cost of transport is increasing
19097 this is killing us because when transport prices rise everything becomes more expensive
19098 in terms of the impact on the price of transportation it means the price of goods imported and exported increases and many of the goods imported are primarily food related so thats an extra cost especially to the poor
19099 everything increases our profit decreases its exhausting but this is happening worldwide we cant do anything about it
19100 the government became aware that it had become impossible for sonabhy to continue working if the price freeze was maintained
19101 we have seen successful attempts at smuggling on the increase in guinea conakry i understand its 27 000 leones a gallon so fuel is smuggled out
19102 i have a responsibility to make sure our state has enough money to pay its bills
19103 california is not a movie set and gridlock is not acceptable
19104 this is real life this is about real people and californians who are hurting they have mortgages to pay they have kids to feed they have work to do and a stunt like a pay cut to 6 55 and hour doesnt solve the problems that californians faces
19105 he has a long set of contacts in sacramento but the 2010 gubernatorial is going to be about folks who are fresh and new on the scene as much as those who cut their teeth working in sacramento
19106 if wed have done what senator obama wanted wed have lost
19107 it will certainly be a list that no college or university president will want to be on
19108 however if they are on it my guess is they will have very good explanations for why for example big budget cuts for state appropriations
19109 recognizes the remarkable power of sunshine and transparency to empower consumers

19114 activisions point of view is theres a lot of trust in blizzard and what we do activisions just trying to figure out how we work and try to learn from us

19131 we are going to make a big big difference in the american marketplace
19132 we are ensuring that the products that come into america are safe for consumers and that the regulating agencies have what they need to do their job
19133 toxic chemicals like lead and phthalates have no business in our childrens toys
19134 safety testing and certification for such hazards as powerful magnets before products are sold a ban on lead and phthalates and more will helpfully put an end to the recalls of childrens products and the horror stories that lead to those recalls
19135 i can go tanning if i want to and i want to
19136 that said these statistics are still teaching us things and we need to constantly be looking at how we use force
19137 i am pleasantly surprised at the low number of times the officers used force
19138 we need to remember that the chief is doing this so he can see if there are areas to improve in
19139 he is doing that on his own initiative and i appreciate that
19140 this is the police department making its own best case and it is self serving and one sided as one would expect
19141 if i were chief of police in san jose and i heard my officers never used deadly force once it would be a headline
19142 since all the votes have been cast before the meeting all thats really left is the theater
19143 i want to hold this board and management team accountable for the last year
19144 it will not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose
19145 i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
19146 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
19147 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
19148 not only did we play the race card we dealt it from the bottom of the deck
19149 if all your friends though jumping off a bridge was cool would you do it too
19150 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 percent on the same period last year
19151 greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
19152 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
19153 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
19154 this year there have been over 84 such incidents including 21 in june more than in any other month in the last six years
19155 so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
19156 increasing and spreading insecurity is jeopardising the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to these people and threatening their lives and livelihoods
19157 i see the temperature between india and pakistan intensifying rather than cooling

19160 daniel x is just your average fifteen year old but only if your average fifteen year old is a bona fide alien hunter
19161 this is a historic step forward in the fight for equal rights for women
19162 some will have you believe that the wage gap for women is a myth that we already have laws in place to make pay discrimination on the basis of gender illegal
19163 but just because something is illegal does not mean that it does not continue to happen
19164 isnt needed to protect women from wage discrimination such protection is already found in the law
19165 at the end of the day this bill will invite more lawyers to file more lawsuits because it offers them a bigger payday
19166 the bill before the house treats pay discrimination as systemic
19167 this bill does little more than dole out favors to the democrats trial lawyer allies with no new benefit to protect workers
19168 more difficult and error prone and invite a surge of litigation
19169 for too many years libya has refused to accept responsibility for its horrific acts of terrorism against american victims but after the pressure we applied libya can finally be held accountable for these devastating events
19170 now these victims and their families can get the long overdue justice they deserve
19171 it will allow them the fair and just compensation that theyve been seeking in an expeditious manner
19172 allow the united states and libya to finally close the book on a contentious period in our relationship and to look to the future
19173 a critical step in our fight for justice for our loved ones
19174 any settlements by other victims should not be at the expense of those who have fought and won in the courts
19175 i believe i have a problem but not to the extent that its being portrayed
19176 your testimony seems all too defensive of the existing system
19177 i would be furious if i were you id be furious if i had to answer for this staggering incompetence
19178 some of these measures require additional work but the agency will come back to these and others each year
19179 we are working hard to improve quality and efficiency but simply not paying for complications or conditions that while regrettable are not entirely preventable is not the way to do it
19180 what matters is helping people not who gets the credit
19181 its more desperation in an attempt to distract from his record of supporting george bush 90 percent of the time
19182 is trying to fool oregon voters into thinking he is something that he is not hes not bipartisan its a myth
19183 partisan gridlock is not the answer to the real hardships facing oregon families gordon smith recognizes that and has shown a better way reaching across the aisle to find answers on the housing crisis gas mileage and health care
19184 gordon smith is my friend but the problem is that when its come time to vote in the senate hes been a much better friend of george bush
19185 voting with george bush 90 percent of the time just isnt good for the people and issues ive fought for over a lifetime
19186 its not personal its about whats best for our country the inescapable fact is that electing jeff merkley is the only way we can win a senate majority that gets things done for people again
19187 tea has not met its obligation to remedy the language deficiencies of texas students
19188 the failure of secondary lep students under every metric clearly and convincingly demonstrates student failure and accordingly the failure of the esl secondary program in texas
19189 these students have long been ignored and it all starts with the state
19190 not anybody in their right mind that would say these are good scores
19191 you can do practically anything to satisfy an esl program
19192 hier soll eine omin se geldvermehrung in gang gesetzt werden die so nicht funktionieren kann
19193 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
19194 weve worked for decades yet our monthly living allowance has never gone up
19195 when workers in government departments get laid off they continue to get their salary until retirement but we were not treated like this by our bosses they did not care they dumped us on the scrapheap giving us a pitiful subsidy of 200 yuan to 300 yuan per month
19196 the more they laid off workers the worse it got until the company finally went bankrupt in july 2006
19197 they didnt care they told us we could either quit or we could get castrated
19198 we said it was not legal it was unfair but they didnt solve our problems
19199 we wouldnt take it lying down we sought out the government one two hundred of us rose up and appealed then they released our representatives
19200 the government doesnt care we need to rely on relatives and friends to make ends meet
19201 i have a child at university tuition and living expenses there come to 15 000 a year
19202 we have to fight for our rights if we dont fight for what is lawfully ours the government wont simply give it to us its not just our factory anymore now were liaising with several textile mills if everyone is united and cooperates then we can finally gain our lawful rights
19203 the government wants to grind us down but so long as breath lasts we laid off workers wont give up we already have nothing so what is there to fear
19204 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
19205 more and more people are becoming practitioners even under such persecution it is becoming a strong moral force that the cpc will not be able to stop one day soon
19206 there is an enormous vacuum in every chinese persons heart no belief no moral standards and in this situation when they meet a falun gong person or read a falun gong book which teaches them how to be a good person and gives moral guidelines for living they are really awakened and shaken
19207 many people like me have really risked our lives including in jail to try and let the world know what is happening and that is enough in my opinion
19208 the problem is that the powers that be are using the games to persecute people
19209 were not trying to overthrow the government were just trying to help people understand the cpcs evil nature and that they can break free
19210 how can i overthrow the government i dont have a weapon and i have to be careful all the time
19211 great art comes from deep in the depths of ones imagination this exhibition is about showcasing those deep thoughts as they are sketched out on paper before becoming a final work

19214 i mean if its presumptuous to limit god to opening and closing doors then what would be a better way to figure out what he wants when you have to make a big decision
19215 i like you too but you didnt answer my question
19216 youre right i didnt do you really want to hear my opnion

19219 right i did then i said so thats it but you didnt hear me the first time i said it and you wanted an answer from me right you wanted to hear what i had to say so you followed me
19220 thats what i think its like wht god if you want to know what he has to say you just follow him yolu stay close you ask and keep asking and you listen hell make it clear the closer you are to him the easier it wis to hear what he is saying
19221 have you ever thought about the way christ led the disciples around during the theree or so years they were together
19222 whats the common thread between me and all of my prior encounters
19223 what am i doing to inspire the behavior that i dont want to see in my relationships
19224 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
19225 we hope to be able to answer the question of whether this was a habitable zone on mars it will be for future missions to find if anyone is home on this environment
19226 move from looking for water to seeing whether there were habitats for life
19227 we are moving towards understanding whether there were or could be places on mars that are habitable
19228 shiro get your ass in here and help me get this house ready

19250 speak oh wise one what you wish for and i will gladly present it to you
19251 i would like to have rolls of yellow cloth to donate to the poor the destitute and children

19255 it was like something between a dog howling and a baby crying i guess you could say
19256 i dont think it will leave me for a while
19257 this boxed set tells the story of the 70s better than any history yet written

19263 me send you an email you should be begging for my email address
19264 unless the pixels are in the middle of the screen and theres more than four dead ones per million we arent replacing it
19265 we cannot reconcile these brand addicted airheads with their cultured forebears
19266 its the democrats turn hes about change we need hope
19267 i knew i couldnt go to the local police for protection because they would be the first men that merril jessop would contact to hunt me down
19268 they could use the fact that my car was not licensed as a legal reason to arrest me
19269 we have found documentary evidence where members of the marshal staff have said we will follow jeffs and not the law
19270 the federal state and local prosecuting and investigating agencies have a proven and effective working relationship but we can do a better job
19271 we believe that our data add to those from previous studies showing a causal relationship between h pylori infection and gastric cancer and also support the use of h pylori eradication to prevent the development of gastric cancer
19272 preventing gastric cancer by eradicating h pylori in high risk regions should be a priority
19273 this result adds to our understanding of the relationship between h pylori and stomach cancer and to the debate on how we should treat people with this infection
19274 you do that too i think its so you dont have to say something you can just recommend a book and be done with it
19275 i will come back for her one day i love her
19276 do you have the fourth book in the dolphin diaries series

19279 mens golf coach o d vincent announced to the team that he was unilaterally canceling andrews eligibility to participate in the universitys athletics program immediately and indefinitely andrew and his teammates were shocked andrew had no prior notice of what was about to happen at no time was andrew ever given an opportunity to defend himself instead he was summarily dismissed
19280 flipped his putter a few feet to his golf bag
19281 im sure theyre going to make a great decision on the vp nominee
19282 i work with lobbyists and folks in pacs all the time in virginia and theyre not bad but i think theres a sense sometimes in washington that they kinda have a veto power over policy initiatives its not a matter of having a seat at the table they should often they have great expertise but sometimes you feel like government is what lobbyists allow to happen rather than what a president or congress decide to focus on as key policies
19283 virginias a very independent state its traditionally been kind of a red state the only way we make things happen is by after election day setting aside the party labels and coming together to really get results for people
19284 it really does have to be about coming together in a bitterly divided time very tough issues very divided its a time for people who want to roll up their sleeves and get results and im a guy who really says results ought to come first its not legislative wins and losses or whos in today and out tomorrow its results that can be measured in peoples lives
19285 like barack i lived in a foreign country at a formative time in my life it made a huge impression on me i think americas been this fantastic force for good and that we need to continue to be that force for good but i think we need to be a force for good that is every bit as much about example as it is about force
19286 i think this president the next president of the united states will walk into the most difficult situation since fdr in 1933
19287 i think success and effort is fundamentally a question of character it is willingness to make tough decisions it is willingness to say look were going in the wrong direction we need to go in another direction
19288 i am going to uphold the laws even the laws i have some discomfort with what i found in 2005 was that was just fine with people they want a thinking feeling believing human being even if some of their views may be different than theirs ive taken some positions that arent completely popular as governor but voters have been willing to support me on them
19289 on abortion i dont know of a single american who doesnt think that we should have fewer abortions ive supported restrictions on abortion ive supported health care access for women better education of youngsters theres a moral gravity to abortion as an issue that has to be respected but i dont think the right strategy to reduce abortion is to criminalize the health care decisions that women and their doctors make i think using the criminal law as a weapon or bludgeon to make these decisions is the wrong way to go about it

19318 engine noises may upset some take the dog on the boat while its docked and start the engine as an introduction
19319 let him walk on and off the boat from the dock let him stay in the boat a little and get used to the motion
19320 most animals wont get seasick but like people some do
19321 just like we would do for rides in a car we can pre medicate them

19323 clean up after your dog there and at the beach or marina

19416 if youre at risk of alzheimers because your mother had the disease you need to make sure that you take special care of your health
19417 if you had a baseline brain scan and then a follow up five years later and it showed that your glucose utilization was falling off rapidly and in a pattern consistent with alzheimers disease that would be of concern
19418 its certainly plausible that if one inherits faulty mitochondria that might put you at increased risk for alzheimers
19419 it may be that decreased glucose utilization doesnt necessarily mean youre going to get alzheimers disease but that in conjunction with the wrong type of environment or some other genes that might give you a slight risk would combine to give it to you
19420 but in a lot of people it probably is just another insult another hit in a biological boxing match

19429 it was sad at the end of montreals race last year because i thought that i probably would never race in nascar again if you would have told me that i would be racing sprint cup and have a pole position i would have laughed it just happened so fast
19430 when i started last year it was like driving a semi truck in major traffic at 200 mph
19431 i was struggling just to keep my head above water i had to eat sleep and dream racing 24 hours a day
19432 i have so much passion for this type of racing ive never done something in racing that ive enjoyed so much i think thats what is helping me succeed
19433 sometimes the drivers take it for granted the 200 000 people crowds and the show that they have we are really fortunate

19436 hazel wants to stay within sports and explore other opportunities
19437 well move everybody into nfl coverage and really tee them up for whats happening in the nfl that day
19438 i just wasnt seeing the production and when you get in a situation where you dont see the production and youve got a young group of receivers that are emerging i just felt like it was in our best interests to let him go at this point
19439 youve got to do whats right for the team i guess its the right move for the team hopefully it is
19440 its a whole different design of a park so its going to be a new experience
19441 i think the most challenging will be the jamming with the five guys competing for 12 minutes there used to be breaks or commercials now its back to back with live scoring so its going to be harder because youre going to need more tricks than usual
19442 i just have to adapt my style of riding to this course
19443 you have to be very quick to act on direction changes
19444 it takes a couple of practice sessions just to get used to it and to figure out a map of where youll be going theres no elements to vert so i have to completely reconfigure the way i ride for me its about getting used to the course finding a rhythm and just using my own style of riding to try to benefit me
19445 i think its good because ill get to compete against people ive never competed against before
19446 ill be with all of my friends and im looking forward to enjoying the weekend

19448 i kind of reassure him the same way i did when i first met him that everything is within his power
19449 i think we can win a super bowl with aaron rodgers
19450 but if brett came back and stepped on that practice field it would test my emotions
19451 he never misses a game sure he retired early he made a mistake he wants to play we went through 20 something years of different quarterbacks before brett rodgers looks good but all quarterbacks look good until they play a bunch of games
19452 i think bretts got another 20 games in him last year we were this close to the super bowl its hard to start over with a young quarterback
19453 if this were his first year thinking of retirement it would have been a different story
19454 but this is the fourth season and he went a lot further this past spring im sure youve seen the video of brett crying we all felt happy that he was going out on a high note now hes changed his mind again they had to move forward for not just this season but for the future
19455 a lot of people feel he may be thinking its the brett favre packers and not the green bay packers but no matter who you are theres no status like that the coach and gm have to go on with their plans
19456 ive watched him play and hes made some terrible decisions
19457 thinking he can get away with throwing off his back foot or into double and triple coverage as a 17 year veteran you should know better than that the gunslinger thing that means to me that hes lost the ability to control things
19458 most people like brett and think he gives us the best chance to win
19459 but theyre sick of hearing about it because the media has been beating them up with it for five years

19467 this law suit is ridiculous and riddled with lie upon lie from verne troyer and his camp it is in our opinion a transparent attempt to secure as much publicity as he can from his less then average career in the wake of his most recent failure in the love guru
19468 i havent done anything except stay in my house the fact that i could be close to somebody and for them to do this is the biggest thing that gets me

19480 basically the cost of things china produces for home depot and wal mart are going up

19490 the acma report is based on a laboratory trial of isp filtering technologies within a network that would be used by a small isp
19491 it is therefore necessary that the government proceed with a real world live pilot to test how these filtering products work with isps of different sizes and network configurations
19492 it is important to note that the tests did not specifically test filtering of a black list independent of over blocking and under blocking
19493 the governments policy is to filter only a black list of illegal content maintained by the acma
19494 while its probably true to say that filtering software doesnt present noticeable performance degradation when youve already artificially constrained the offered traffic rate to below dial up speeds its difficult to see the relevance of that conclusion in a world where the minister wants everyone in australia to connect over 500 times faster
19495 i believe that the reported level of degradation is unlikely to be acceptable even to government
19496 just before the competition i realized that i had gained 10 pounds
19497 i remember watching that medal ceremony watching people up there i knew i should be jumping better than and listening to the russian national anthem
19498 i was so touched by the olympic spirit i remember setting a goal right then i would be back in the 1968 olympics and id be on that podium
19499 for so many of us it was a childhood dream to compete in the olympics for ed it was a double whammy because hed been before gotten a taste and he wanted to go and shine
19500 we were like a union negotiating about whether we should go except without any violence
19501 id worked four years and given up a lot to get back to the olympics
19502 i thought hmm thats an interesting way to make a statement but i really didnt think much more about it than that at the time
19503 the only black socks id brought with me were a nylon kind of material when i went to jump my foot would kind of slide so i didnt wear any socks
19504 i thought he was nuts a real goofball when i first saw him jump that way
19505 but i gained more respect leading up to the olympics when he started having success with it
19506 when i was up on that podium i thought back to four years earlier and when i set out to get back to the olympics and get up on that stand
19507 as i listened to the star spangled banner i was proud id made it
19508 it made me think of all the abilities id been given and how hard they students had to try to make just a little progress
19509 it was both frustrating and incredibly rewarding to be part of
19510 he came back from the olympic qualifying event this year saying i cant believe how many people asked for my autograph he just doesnt think of himself in that way

19515 miller is a fine writer who sharply addresses the details of the arguments about intelligent design creationism when tackling old chestnuts such as the only a theory complaint or michael behes argument for a maximum limit for the number of genetic mutations or william dembskis rehash of william paleys watchmaker argument for complexity miller discusses the contemporary biological explanations while refuting the errors
19516 religious leanings give him insight into both sides of the struggle
19517 opposes them uncompromisingly miller does not confuse sympathy for the intent of creationists with sympathy for its effects the conflict has wider consequences than the teaching of one discipline in us public schools the creationists aim to revise what science means discarding rationalism naturalism materialism and other enlightenment values to incorporate the supernatural and loosen the rigour of all sciences
19518 we were very afraid for the kids we were scared and im very happy
19519 i was stunned because i see the two little boys that are upstairs sleeping on the news missing
19520 i said what happened to the dogs and they said no we couldnt get any help from anybody
19521 if dogs would have come at least i would have known that they were not in the woods and a little creek i was afraid they might have gone to the park and get attacked by a dog maybe
19522 its something that im looking at you know in a situation like that every resource that we have is available to any member of this department
19523 all of the law enforcement people in our county put all of their efforts and were as concerned about his child as they would be any child thats missing in prince georges county
19524 i felt very little like no value like it was not worth like your boys werent important yeah
19525 china would never take to hegemonism and expansionism and posed no threat to any other country liang said
19526 through gestures and reactions through the whole dynamism of tension and enjoyment whose direct source is the body in its masculinity and femininity the body in its action and interaction through all this man the person speaks precisely on the level of this language of the body man and woman reciprocally express themselves in the fullest and most profound way made possible for them by their masculinity and femininity
19527 no one takes my life from me i lay it down of my own accord
19528 have you come here freely and without reservation to give yourselves to each other in marriage do you promise to be faithful until death do you promise to receive children lovingly from god
19529 in fact the words themselves i take you as my wife as my husband
19530 we pass to the reality that corresponds to these words
19531 im very disappointed and race will not have any role in my campaign nor is there any place for it im disappointed that hes used race
19532 its very clear what his comments imply anyone who looks at those and previous comments that he has made i think its very clear that he has im very disappointed and i repeat it wont be part of our campaign
19533 senator obama has continuously attacked me but the point is that were drawing differences between our two campaigns what we stand for and believe in that is clearly what the ad was all about it it was about energy and it was about taxes
19534 hes run negative ads on me continuously and i might point out for the record that he was the first i think it was an ad that points out the differences between our two plans of action that we for america
19535 upon its completion of the longest continuous deployment of any united states ground combat military unit in operation iraqi freedom
19536 the ap has done a number of serial narratives in the past
19537 some of those have been fairly sweeping however weve done nothing of this length before and nothing this comprehensive before
19538 at first i wasnt quite sure what i wanted to do with this story
19539 i realized it would have to be a more in depth examination not just a story of the battlefield
19540 we made a very long list of different types of people we wanted to talk to people with kids for example so we wound up with a broad scope and a broad array of people to talk to
19541 these were national guard units so they werent full time soldiers
19542 these were people who knew each other one of the soldiers was a national guard recruiter who was serving with his brother there were real ties there to their families their neighbors and their community
19543 what helped me in the reporting was the candor of the soldiers and their families
19544 they were very open and honest in discussing traumatic moments in their lives and the adjustments they made when they came home they didnt sugarcoat anything they answered every question and were patient in describing in detail everything from their memories of getting wounded to the struggles in starting over these people were amazingly courageous resilient and very positive they went through rehab and hospitalization and showed a lot of grit and determination
19545 ive read this story many times over and there are still parts of the story that make me tear up
19546 i mean thats just being human these people have lived really interesting lives before during and after the war and seeing them makes you even more certain that you have to do your job
19547 myself and my deputy chris sullivan functioned as cheerleaders as a sounding booth for sharon while i was asking myself how can i put all this together
19548 it was just a matter of getting her to do it in such large terms it wasnt as if we gave her instructions this was very much her story
19549 the war is not just a story thats being played out in iraq its played out every day here on the home front
19550 it smells like there was a dead body in the damn car
19551 the evidence of decomposition would lead you to believe would it not that there is the possibility that this child is no longer alive
19552 how do you deal with what theyre saying about in the trunk of the car
19553 there was a bag of pizza for like 12 days in the trunk of the car full of maggots it stunk so bad you know how hot its been
19554 about every other day ive taken a look at it the first day or two you open the trunk and you have the smell of pizza but after that nothing
19555 there was a bag of pizza for like 12 days in the trunk of the car full of maggots it stunk so bad you know how hot its been
19556 in essence obama has declared the war in iraq all but over
19557 there is rebuilding people are getting jobs a year ago i couldnt go to university because militias would check your id
19558 i personally believe that there is a real possibility of some additional drawdowns as we look forward
19559 some level of durability i think is one that fits
19560 but its still not irreversible we havent gotten to that point
19561 then we clearly are looking at afghanistan where results are mixed
19562 the challenges are certainly significant and wed like to get additional troops there as soon as we could
19563 i almost registered as a democrat to be rebellious but i registered as an independent instead
19564 i think its time to reinvent the republican party and i think my dad can do it
19565 the wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes so is everyone who is born of the spirit
19566 all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
19567 this administration is planning a right wing assault on values and ideals
19568 what should be a no damage bump turns into a thousand dollar repair job
19569 theres something wrong with the way the system is set up
19570 the hard part of getting water to split is not the hydrogen platinum as a catalyst works fine for the hydrogen but platinum works very poorly for oxygen making you use much more energy
19571 what we have done is made a catalyst work for the oxygen part without any extra energy in fact with our catalyst almost 100 percent of the current used for electrolysis goes into making oxygen and hydrogen
19572 nickel oxide cant be used around anything else in the environment because of corrosion even the carbon dioxide in the air will react with it to make carbonates
19573 but our catalyst uses abundant materials that dont react with environment
19574 because our catalyst is green the machines that perform electrolysis can be much less expensive than they are today since they dont need to be protected from environmental contaminants
19575 solar cell makers can add super cheap electrolyzers to their system so that they work 24 7 during the day making hydrogen and oxygen then at night recombining it in fuel cells to generate electricity
19576 there are always crane accidents occurring the issue is you dont hear about them
19577 theyre usually local news unless you lose an entire crane in manhattan they are highly visible then it becomes something everybody is aware of
19578 after a while it will quiet down and itll go back to being local news again
19579 there are always crane accidents occurring the issue is you dont hear about them
19580 theyre usually local news unless you lose an entire crane in manhattan
19581 in the days leading up to and following my testimony my friends told me amazing and poetic basketball stories about their fathers sons and jump shots these were love stories
19582 we now have cells in culture that are genetically the same as in those with the disease
19583 decode the pathways through which mutations cause damage to motor neurons
19584 whether immature neurons really reflect the inherited damage that follows only after decades in the human
19585 we have laid the groundwork for the types of assay that we should do with these cells and now were going to do it
19586 in the days leading up to and following my testimony my friends told me amazing and poetic basketball stories about their fathers sons and jump shots these were love stories
19587 what we wanted to do and i think something that we were equipped to do was to provide a forum that is really meant to be uplifting to servicemembers
19588 when we went to vegas we thought we ought to get some shows
19589 weve got star trek jersey boys stomp and the chippendales next week is kind of vegas week on moment of thanks
19590 from the very beginning when we started this we reached out to soldiers angels which was incredibly responsive because our mission so clearly meshed with their mission to do anything to support the troops
19591 theyve been helping make introductions to people and helping to spread the word within their organization
19592 in the days leading up to and following my testimony my friends told me amazing and poetic basketball stories about their fathers sons and jump shots these were love stories
19593 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
19594 they only care about power and pushing forward their communist agenda
19595 in the days leading up to and following my testimony my friends told me amazing and poetic basketball stories about their fathers sons and jump shots these were love stories
19596 we now need to take account of the decision of a significant number of anglican bishops not to attend this lambeth conference
19597 in such a scenario who will our dialogue partner be should we and how can we appropriately and honestly engage in conversations also with those who share catholic perspectives on the points currently in dispute and who disagree with some developments within the anglican communion or particular anglican provinces
19598 were it not for romes strong insistence upon christ as the only saviour of the world upon the catholic faith the nature of the triune god the divinity of christ the importance of sacred scripture and of the objectivity of christian morality then the life of other christian churches would have been so much more difficult certainly for us here in the west
19599 among those in which catholic traditions and institutions in part continue to exist the anglican communion occupies a special place
19600 as the roman catholic church and the constituent churches of the anglican communion have sought to grow in mutual understanding and christian love they have come to recognize to value and to give thanks for a common faith in god our father in our lord jesus christ and in the holy spirit our common baptism into christ our sharing of the holy scriptures of the apostles and nicene creeds the chalcedonian definition and the teaching of the fathers our common christian inheritance for many centuries with its living traditions of liturgy theology spirituality and mission
19601 to the achievement of points of convergence and even of agreement which many would not have thought possible before the commission began its work
19602 as our dialogue has developed many catholics and anglicans have found in each other a love for christ which invites us into practical co operation and service this fellowship in the service of christ experienced by many of our communities around the world adds a further impetus to our relationship
19603 the questions and problems of our friends are also our questions and problems
19604 since this mississauga meeting however the churches of the anglican communion have entered into a period of dispute occasioned by the episcopal ordination of a person living in an openly acknowledged committed same sex relationship and the authorisation of public rites of blessing for same sex unions these matters have intensified reflection on the nature of the relationship between the churches of the communion in addition ecumenical relationships have become more complicated as proposals within the church of england have focussed attention on the issue of the ordination of women to the episcopate which is an established part of ministry in some anglican provinces
19605 quam unitatem tenere firmiter et vindicare debemus maxime episcopi qui in ecclesia praesidimus ut episcopatum quoque ipsum unum atque indivisum probemus
19606 episcopatus unus est cuius a singulis in solidum pars tenetur
19607 united and held together by the glue of the mutual cohesion of the bishops
19608 for the nurture and growth of this communion christ the lord has provided a ministry of oversight the fullness of which is entrusted to the episcopate which has the responsibility of maintaining and expressing the unity of the churches cf 33 amp 39 final report ministry and ordination by shepherding teaching and the celebration of the sacraments especially the eucharist this ministry holds believers together in the communion of the local church and in the wider communion of all the churches cf 39 this ministry of oversight has both collegial and primatial dimensions it is grounded in the life of the community and is open to the communitys participation in the discovery of gods will it is exercised so that unity and communion are expressed preserved and fostered at every level locally regionally and universally
19609 intended to assure each community that its faith is indeed the apostolic faith received and transmitted from apostolic times
19610 there are two dimensions to communion in the apostolic tradition diachronic and synchronic the process of tradition clearly entails the transmission of the gospel from one generation to another diachronic if the church is to remain united in the truth it must also entail the communion of the churches in all places in that one gospel synchronic both are necessary for the catholicity of the church 26
19611 both a voice for the local church and one through whom the local church learns from other churches
19612 the mutual interdependence of all the churches is integral to the reality of the church as god wills it to be no local church that participates in the living tradition can regard itself as self sufficient the ministry of the bishop is crucial for his ministry serves communion within and among local churches their communion with each other is expressed through the incorporation of each bishop into a college of bishops bishops are both personally and collegially at the service of the communion
19613 n otwithstanding the substantial ecclesiological issues still dividing us which will continue to need our attention this approach is fundamentally in line with the communion ecclesiology of the second vatican council the consequences which the report draws from this ecclesiological base are also constructive especially the interpretation of provincial autonomy in terms of interdependence thus subject to limits generated by the commitments of communion windsor n 79 related to this is the reports thrust towards strengthening the supra provincial authority of the archbishop of canterbury nn 109 110 and the proposal of an anglican covenant which would make explicit and forceful the loyalty and bonds of affection which govern the relationships between the churches of the communion n 118
19614 w hile the report stresses that anglican provinces have a responsibility towards each other and towards the maintenance of communion a communion rooted in the scriptures considerably little attention is given to the importance of being in communion with the faith of the church through the ages
19615 has important ecumenical ramifications since we share a common tradition of one and a half millennia this common patrimony what pope paul vi and archbishop michael ramsey called our ancient common traditions is worth being appealed to and preserved
19616 it is our overwhelming desire that the anglican communion stays together rooted in the historic faith which our dialogue and relations over four decades have led us to believe that we share to a large degree
19617 in the discussions on human sexuality within the anglican communion and between it and the catholic church stand anthropological and biblical hermeneutical questions which need to be addressed
19618 priestly ordination in the catholic church from the beginning has always been reserved to men alone
19619 this tradition has also been faithfully maintained by the oriental churches
19620 i declare that the church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the churchs faithful
19621 lead to that unity in truth for which christ prayed
19622 a restoration of complete communion of faith and sacramental life
19623 belonging to the church of christ are forces impelling toward catholic unity
19624 in the days leading up to and following my testimony my friends told me amazing and poetic basketball stories about their fathers sons and jump shots these were love stories
19625 that must be a shadow oh my god its not thats what i really look like
19626 in the days leading up to and following my testimony my friends told me amazing and poetic basketball stories about their fathers sons and jump shots these were love stories
19627 in the days leading up to and following my testimony my friends told me amazing and poetic basketball stories about their fathers sons and jump shots these were love stories
19628 either have the people move out or lift up the houses above flood level
19629 the quality of life has gone up the inconvenience of storms has gone down
19630 its one of the most dangerous things that an officer or trooper will be involved in when they engaged in a pursuit
19631 im sure most citizens think troopers or other law enforcement officers enjoy these types of speed pursuits because of how tv has sensationalized it most of them will tell you they dont
19632 we want everyone to reduce their dependency on bottled water
19633 we did ask gbb to go back to the court and ask them for mulching machines because they mayors are constantly clearing the sides of the road for safety and whatever reason and our residents dont
19634 right now people are actually going to the extent of chopping the hose which you would fill your gas at the gas station where the gas runs in
19635 i absolutely love the manga adaptation of cirque du freak
19636 takahiro arai brings freshness and vitality to the story that sweeps readers along in a happy blur this is more than a worthy companion piece to the books its a great piece of story telling in its own right its shantastic
19637 this has been a great opportunity for us to publish a manga edition of cirque du freak not only in japan but also in the united states
19638 we are honored that our manga editions will help readers discover the wonderful story of cirque du freak we put our heart and soul into making this book enjoy
19639 yen press is thrilled to bring shogakukans manga adaptation of darren shans bestselling series to north america arais take on the story is sure to attract both manga fans and long time fans of the novels alike 2009 is definitely shaping up to be the year of the freak
19640 youre really good at that you should be an artist when you grow up
19641 i just wasnt seeing the production and when you get in a situation where you dont see the production and youve got a young group of receivers that are emerging i just felt like it was in our best interests to let him go at this point
19642 youve got to do whats right for the team i guess its the right move for the team hopefully it is
19643 for me its a celebration of the start of it all
19644 it was sad at the end of montreals race last year because i thought that i probably would never race in nascar again if you would have told me that i would be racing sprint cup and have a pole position i would have laughed it just happened so fast
19645 when i started last year it was like driving a semi truck in major traffic at 200 mph
19646 i was struggling just to keep my head above water i had to eat sleep and dream racing 24 hours a day
19647 i have so much passion for this type of racing ive never done something in racing that ive enjoyed so much i think thats what is helping me succeed
19648 sometimes the drivers take it for granted the 200 000 people crowds and the show that they have we are really fortunate
19649 to qualify the car and do one quick lap is one thing
19650 but to hold that speed for 60 to 80 laps is really hard thats what these guys are masters at
19651 with lacrosse even though all you may have initially is a die hard group it spreads very quickly
19652 it really combines the field strategy of soccer with the offense and defense of basketball the physical contact of ice hockey and open field excitement of football
19653 a lot of the athletic directors in the county didnt like the way he implemented it but you have to give him credit
19654 my former ad fought it but when he finally let us on campus we came in right behind basketball in revenue the first year on campus i have 70 kids come out for the team every year and we keep about 30
19655 i have dvds on lacrosse stacked to the ceiling in the house
19656 i just study the game brad connett one of my assistant coaches had played at north carolina and really helped us with the fundamentals i was very knowledgable about basketball and the two sports coincide very well ive become good friends with college coaches and i pick their brains all the time
19657 i never even played a sport when i was in school i got a book and the girls and i learned out of a book
19658 weve also had a lot of people who have come out of the woodwork to help out of the five years ive only had two girls who had played before if you can run i can teach you how to play
19659 i think we can win a super bowl with aaron rodgers
19660 but if brett came back and stepped on that practice field it would test my emotions
19661 he never misses a game sure he retired early he made a mistake he wants to play we went through 20 something years of different quarterbacks before brett rodgers looks good but all quarterbacks look good until they play a bunch of games
19662 i think bretts got another 20 games in him last year we were this close to the super bowl its hard to start over with a young quarterback
19663 if this were his first year thinking of retirement it would have been a different story
19664 but this is the fourth season and he went a lot further this past spring im sure youve seen the video of brett crying we all felt happy that he was going out on a high note now hes changed his mind again they had to move forward for not just this season but for the future
19665 a lot of people feel he may be thinking its the brett favre packers and not the green bay packers but no matter who you are theres no status like that the coach and gm have to go on with their plans
19666 ive watched him play and hes made some terrible decisions
19667 thinking he can get away with throwing off his back foot or into double and triple coverage as a 17 year veteran you should know better than that the gunslinger thing that means to me that hes lost the ability to control things
19668 most people like brett and think he gives us the best chance to win
19669 but theyre sick of hearing about it because the media has been beating them up with it for five years
19670 its a whole different design of a park so its going to be a new experience
19671 i think the most challenging will be the jamming with the five guys competing for 12 minutes there used to be breaks or commercials now its back to back with live scoring so its going to be harder because youre going to need more tricks than usual
19672 i just have to adapt my style of riding to this course
19673 you have to be very quick to act on direction changes
19674 it takes a couple of practice sessions just to get used to it and to figure out a map of where youll be going theres no elements to vert so i have to completely reconfigure the way i ride for me its about getting used to the course finding a rhythm and just using my own style of riding to try to benefit me
19675 i think its good because ill get to compete against people ive never competed against before
19676 ill be with all of my friends and im looking forward to enjoying the weekend
19677 im just pretty proud that he kind of looks to me for advice even though hes at the top of his game
19678 i kind of reassure him the same way i did when i first met him that everything is within his power
19679 hazel wants to stay within sports and explore other opportunities
19680 well move everybody into nfl coverage and really tee them up for whats happening in the nfl that day
19681 it was a hard decision i know im doing it for the right reasons
19682 blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted
19683 i dont mind being punished for something i did not for something i didnt do
19684 a national teen magazine book series and website devoted entirely to teenage writing and art
19685 producers are convinced that the role of the riddler is perfect for depp johnnys a pro hell be able to take direction from director chris nolan and still make the character his own
19686 its sad this is our last time doing a movie together and we love each other so much we really grew up together we can be free when were around one another and the amount of fun we have is ridiculous
19687 i like putting things together that you would not expect its always me
19688 i dont want to do something that messes me up mentally i think people just dont realize that sometimes actors can really take it in and become that person
19689 it was great to hear one of my favorite writers talk honestly about his work
19690 this cat does extensive research i mean he puts in the kind of research that like james lipton would have his crew do on largehearted boy
19691 i was interviewed by a very bright and engaging fellow
19692 wow do i tell him things i wouldnt expect to say in an interview hes that good its the closest ive come to being on pamela ribon
19693 very seldom do i get to say all these things because im not asked about them and i appreciate your asking
19694 hes a funny smart guy and asked a lot of good questions
19695 one of the great literary interviewers of our time listen for how often his subjects are struck by his discovery of an unknown to them pattern of imagery or tic of diction
19696 that should have been my first warning when you first said ill give you a softball question like theres going to be a hardball but what
19697 i know who you are i know exactly what you do
19698 while i had listened to several of the bats casts over the last year it is only when you consume one sometimes two a day over the course of a week that you really begin to get the wow factor of all the bat has time to do i mean the intros alone are sort of other worldly
19699 bat segundo is clearly a nutcase i would advise anyone against paying him any credence
19700 what could quite possibly be the coolest radio show in the history of ever
19701 i cannot believe she would question the importance of the bat segundo show
19702 really a matt segundo who is vamping it up with a vampire accent
19703 an interweb sideshow of great distinction and absolutely spiffing podcasts
19704 a terrific literary podcast that boasts some absolutely stellar author interviews
19705 since all the votes have been cast before the meeting all thats really left is the theater
19706 i want to hold this board and management team accountable for the last year
19707 it will not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose
19708 i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
19709 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
19710 this is idaho and country music reigns despite my point of view judging by alabamas extreme popularity and longevity im sure the coeur dalene casino will be packed to the walls tonight at 7 p m for owens solo appearance the scents of tanned leather and old spice mingling to create a heavy pong in the air
19711 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

19714 we are committed to ensuring that the products that come into america are safe for consumers and that the regulating agencies have what they need in order to do their job
19715 law governing an acceptable filming distance from an unwilling subject to keep everybody safe and misbehaviour accountable
19716 i dont sit before you today to ask that you ban the paparazzi im asking you to regulate it officialise it tax it legitimise it
19717 i dont want to beg the city of los angeles to give me 1987 back i love being a famous musician in 2008 this is about safety
19718 thats definitely been the rumour and its been coming from their west and obamas camp i hear that its his obamas birthday that weekend so he might be in town
19719 but these guys youre never going to know anything until the last minute anyway thats what ive been told ive heard those same rumours and that would be really cool right
19720 my brothers tumour for the time being is in limbo its not growing for the time being which is good news
19721 a government big enough to give you everything you want is strong enough to take everything you have
19722 you know she wasnt the kind that played with dolls and then all of the sudden she has all of these children
19723 britney started wearing clothes and lindsay lohan has gone gay
19724 if the ones that attract the paparazzi behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 per cent of the problem the rest we can deal with
19725 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
19726 i just moved my mom out to atlanta with me i bought her a townhouse so i dont have to go too far shes my closest companion

19730 we didnt lose anything today im delighted with the dismissal we won and in essence our lawsuit against gibson remains totally intact
19731 increasingly people have a lack of cooking skills or time to cook and that is significant for the food industry they want to get something for dinner tonight get it quickly and get home
19732 it is a shift that is happening now 50 of our current business is between 3pm and 6pm that is basically mum picking up the kids on the way home from work and we are responding to that
19733 the model is designed not to be as shopping centre dependent
19734 in the last five years shopping centre rent increases have been significant so we hope this will allow us to open stores in lower rent environments
19735 we will need to broaden out customer perceptions and help people understand what were doing
19736 our research suggests people associate lenards with quality and trust and we think they trust lenards meat products
19737 lens still very actively involved hes been a driver of all this so it is not a challenge to him he is very pro it
19738 the great strength of the franchising model is the dedicated owner in the store even when you can find an employee in current times they tend to want to clock on and off but an owner will always work to drive the business forward because they are motivated by profit
19739 more capital investment is required but clearly you get more margin out of company owned stores
19740 we have been very open and honest and we know our moral and legal obligations to our franchises theyve got licences over territory and we will make sure they will not in any way conflict with the new businesses
19741 the economic benefits of it literacy in emerging markets are currently driving the push for the 100 pc but there are many open questions that remain
19742 these include determining the relevant hardware specifications power availability availability and cost of internet connection as well as providing adequate finance and payment options for emerging markets where funds may well be extremely limited
19743 sort of main road which is off of the equally sort of main road that is off the real main road
19744 i know exactly what you are talking about i have worked for my company for nine years and for our 10th year of service we are flown to tokyo for a trip to head office and to be honoured for our service
19745 in the past we have had about 3 staff turnover a year we got a new boss last year and one of the first things he did to cut costs was to take away this perk i was so close to getting my trip you cannot believe how mad i am not only that since he changed the rule our staff turn over has escalated to 18 and the boss wonders why
19746 you are quite right naomi i tell anyone and everyone who will listen about how stingy my employer has got and that i missed out just one year before i was due
19747 at our office we still have a them and us attitude the executives get chocolate biscuits we get family assorted they get a tea lady we get make your own tea

19755 our economic woes are so severe that i wanted to talk to you personally
19756 the damage on wall street is infecting all of our communities and its effects on our new york state finances are devastating
19757 we can only assume your ill timed and poorly conceived pursuit of republic is designed to disrupt what you perceive as a competitive threat to your position in the market
19758 an acquisition of republic will most certainly burden the company with excessive debt distract your management result in significant regulatory burdens and thereby reduce shareholder value
19759 we encourage you to act with the best interests of your shareholders in mind in a responsible and prudent manner and to abandon this acquisition
19760 we already knew the economy was weak and now you have both a negative growth number coupled with job losses
19761 its not as good as wed like it to be but i want to remind you a few months ago there were predictions and that the economy would shrink this quarter not grow
19762 clearly the tax rebates did give some oomph to the economy
19763 in an environment where the global economy is clearly slowing youre not being able to get that export growth in future quarters
19764 this reflects sheer panic by retailers about what the next christmas buying season is going to look like
19765 it shows theres a shortage of liquidity in the system
19766 what that tells you is that theres an increasing number of banks that the fed is classifying as unsound or inadequately capitalized
19767 i am sure there are troubled banks trying to tap the window
19768 more and more banks are trying to take advantage of the pure economic advantage of borrowing at a cheap rate and you are seeing a gradual fading away of the stigma of using the discount window
19769 we maintain the big transport clients who are the ones contracting the drivers to do their work they are basically holding out on paying these drivers a fair rate of pay
19770 coles and woolies and the big retailers they have the power to do that
19771 if you drive on drugs youre out of your mind
19772 this campaign specifically targets the high number of young men putting themselves and others at risk when driving on drugs
19773 basic preparations include clearing overhanging branches from their roofs and cleaning gutters
19774 i wouldnt have a clue i mean its been a while since petes called me for some advice
19775 the problem with the libs is not personality or even structure its policy
19776 when i look back at peters career hes never had the balls to challenge or make a move or actually move to get the job in circumstances where he could have got it
19777 i dont think youll have to worry about pushing brendan
19778 blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted
19779 i dont mind being punished for something i did not for something i didnt do
19780 we do look for acquisitions and we will continue to do so
19781 in this industry many times majority controlling stakes are actually not available
19782 some of the developing countries have fairly restrictive policies regarding ownership of airlines for instance in india
19783 are you suggesting that we wipe or clean up the city huh

19790 autorizaram o uso de armamento letal nos fatos de sucre
19791 it is regrettable we have had to take the difficult decision to restructure our glasgow office but falling demand for passports means ips must make decisions to maintain our high standards across the business
19792 customers will still receive the same first rate service when applying for passports and glasgows public counter will remain open to provide assistance including issuing urgent and emergency passports
19793 i am very disappointed and fear this is the nail in the coffin for the future of passport services in scotland
19794 this is a very serious situation with nearly 50 per cent of the posts going it is a huge blow
19795 when the government is attempting to talk up its border security credentials it is nonsensical for them to be making swingeing cuts to the last remaining passport office in scotland
19796 the passport office is a vital public service and people across glasgow will be affected by the decision to axe over 100 staff
19797 im not going to rest until i get some kind of justice
19798 we will be the first people to apply for a transport and works order under legislation passed last december
19799 these proposals will not only improve the steps but make this entrance suitable for a range of users who are currently unable to access the station from princes street
19800 there is an economic downturn affecting the whole of the uk edinburgh is no exception
19801 there is a common misconception that edinburgh in august is fully booked and were trying to spread the message that there is still plenty of opportunity for people to enjoy the citys fabulous festivals
19802 ive certainly never heard of visitscotland doing anything like this in august before
19803 i know bookings are well down although the industry is pretty confident it will recover through last minute bookings
19804 its pretty unheard of for so much accommodation to be available and theres no denying things have been slow
19805 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
19806 pop goes the church should the church engage pop culture

19826 praise be a moderate poverty for he who possesses less is so much the less possessed
19827 what was i thinking that i could write this book
19828 unless a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die it remains alone by itself
19829 gains in saving lives by preventing new infections and providing treatment to people living with hiv must be sustained over the long term short term gains should serve as a platform for reinvigorating combination hiv prevention and treatment efforts and not spur complacency
19830 substantial increases in hiv prevention efforts producing results but not enough to turn back the epidemic
19831 the intensity of the epidemic means were far away from realising our goal for universal access by 2010
19832 for every person put on treatment more get infected we cannot sustain a successful response if we do not get on top of prevention
19833 where theres clear and strong commitment and a mobilisation of national and international resources african states can demonstrate world leadership in their response around aids
19834 unless we can reverse these trends unless we can empower women and recognise womens human rights and deal with gender based violence we are unlikely to make significant progress in the fight against hiv and aids
19835 i think the time has come for us to say yes culture is what defines us but if culture is killing us then we need to be bold enough to say that
19836 respoinding to aids is an important millennium development goal which also has a direct impact on meeting the other goals by 2015
19837 the progress we make in addressing aids will contribute to our efforts to reducing poverty and child mortality and to improving nutrition and maternal health at the same time progress towards the other goals such as tackling gender inequality and promoting education is required if we are to halt and reverse the spread of aids
19838 im not sure we will ever get to a point where we can say this is not a public health problem
19839 he in no way appears disabled hes been through hell and has come out a better stronger guy hes matured he knows whats important in his life

19844 if i testify about myself my testimony is not true

19850 things more excellent than every image are expressed through images
19851 belonging as they eloquent words do to the essence of man s personality and partaking of the qualities of the creator they are of spiritual significance
19852 for poetry was all written before time was and whenever we are so finely organized that we can penetrate into that region wehre the air is music we hear those primal warblins and attempt to write them down but we lose ever and anon a word or a verse and substitute something of our own and thus miswrite the poem
19853 nature offers all her creatures to him as a picture language
19854 it is nature the symbol nature certifying the supernatural body overflowed by life which he the poet worships with coarse but sincere rites
19855 science always goes abreast with the just elevation of the man keeping step with religion and metaphysics or the state of science is an index of our self knowledge
19856 we are children of the fire made of it and only the same divinity transmuted and at two or three removes when we know least about it
19857 the thought and form are equal in the order of time but in the order of genesis the thought is prior to the form
19858 god has not made some beautiful things but beauty is the creator of the universe
19859 a true believer in the world dealing with men and matters as if they were divine in idea and real in fact
19860 this suggests two influencing factors social and intellectual stimulation and trauma
19861 in practice it shows how important it is to put resources into helping people who have undergone a crisis if our interpretation will hold such an intervention strategy could also be profitable for society considering the costs for dementia care
19862 its not that im in favor of the ordiance its just im between a rock and hard spot the elections are here
19863 britney has made clear to everyone that she does not want to be further harassed or contacted in any way by osama sam lutfi now or at anytime in the future
19864 is that the fishbowl in the picture where you did your interviews
19865 a lot of times these cars are stolen for parts and as cars get older they need replacement parts more often and then also older cars dont have the security devices newer cars have
19866 the honda accord is a very popular car to purchase and so there are going to be more of them needing parts
19867 the most popular cars to buy are not always but more often the most popular cars to be stolen so its a matter of popularity
19868 its mostly older models cars anywhere from 1990 to the mid 80s
19869 they stole it we found it and returned it and they stole it again
19870 thats their choice right now theyre not trying to get something fancy just something to joy ride in
19871 from my experience they want to take them to transport things that were stolen and then we find them parked on the side of the road somewhere
19872 my dad is a pilot so when you hear about a plane crash it hits home
19873 my heart goes out to all the family relatives and friends of the victims

19881 a crowd had gathered all of a sudden from out of nowhere and this white detective runs in and bam
19882 it was almost a race riot so the police got scared and hurried up and got my ass out of there and took me to the 54th precinct where they took pictures of me bleeding and shit
19883 modern games are about coddling the player so they have fun
19884 these steps would send the worst possible signal to cubas dictators there is no need to undertake fundamental reforms they can simply wait for a unilateral change in u s policy
19885 i know that his naivete and lack of experience is on display when he talks about sitting down opposite hugo chavez or raul castro or ahmadinejad

19919 part of the midwestern psyche is you do the work and that should speak for itself
19920 design has an equal place at the creative table as anything else here
19921 we wanted to create a place that was more about the ideas and less about fiefdoms and trying to incorporate more disciplines together into the creative process
19922 therefore a typical creative team at mono includes an interactive specialist and a designer in addition to the traditional copywriter art director pair
19923 our model is that the more of those different approaches we can bring to a problem earlier on the more interesting the solutions are going to be

19940 mike kinsellas first album under the moniker owen 2001s owen was a welcome and surprising change considering he was always the drummer in various arty chicago bands with his brother tim including capn jazz and joan of arc as singer songwriter albums flooded the college radio airwaves just after the turn of the century kinsella took that stagnated formula and tweaked it just slightly letting his pretty soft tunes linger and drone creating the aural equivalent of warm sunshine through a window in the dead of winter

19942 i am a 40 something white male living in the midwest i just watched your interview about the pakistani american father in georgia who allegedly killed his daughter out of honor i was impressed by your very clear and concise explanation of the reason this man feels he is not guilty perhaps more important was your explanation of how his thinking in this matter is culturally based and not religious in nature adding even more to your credibility is that you stated in this country this is murder even if it is not considered so in other countries in only a few minutes your information gave me a clearer understanding of islam than i have ever had and actually left me wanting to understand more as in so many instances fear of something is often a result of lacking knowledge i think in the united states that could not be more true as it relates to islam or for that matter some other religions too i thank you for presenting a clearer picture for me and all those watching
19943 i think youve hit the nail on the head with ijtihad every 10th grader should know the cradle of civilization is at the tigris and euphrates rivers the fertile crescent every 10th grader should know that if it wasnt for the libraries in moorish spain the knowledge of the greeks romans egyptians and the other ancients would have been lost forever at the hands of the roman church muslims seem to be in their own dark ages no thought no opinion just submission thats what it was like in medieval europe zillions of serfs were ordered to keep tilling the land pay your taxes and do what youre told the big pay off was in the next life where the first shall be last and the last shall be first today thats called the mushroom theory you know keep em in the dark and feed em bullshit ijtihad youll be saving zillions over the next thousand years from an impotent dreary lifeless existence thanks for your efforts from a member of the planet
