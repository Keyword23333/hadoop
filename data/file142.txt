1420014 people think of alcohol as being a diuretic but if you are already hydrated a small amount of beer could be a way of getting the fluid in if you are dehydrated to start with following exercise a beer as opposed to a spirit probably does not have a high enough concentration of alcohol to induce a diuretic increased urination effect

1420022 a different population of detainees a different group of interrogators and for different intelligence needs
1420023 torture is counterproductive on all fronts it produces bad intelligence it ruins the subject makes them useless for further interrogation and it damages our credibility around the world

1420164 to provide the magic wand to make it happen properly
1420165 generally every firm has at least one or two attorney champions they rely upon to handle edd matters they are extremely valuable and rare
1420166 being forced to run their law departments as business units
1420167 what i like most is working directly with other attorneys and our clients to develop reasonable and defensible approaches to edd issues
1420168 as litigation support efforts within the firm developed i evolved into an interface role between the litigation support group and the attorneys
1420169 in addition to document productions and other e discovery aspects of litigation the group gets involved in counseling clients on document management and document retention policies and hiring and working with vendors
1420170 when people feel like they are part of something that is growing and is cutting edge they tend to stick around
1420171 has been a good source of revenue for the firm as a whole
1420172 we have had lawyers more commonly paralegals leave the firm and take jobs with our vendors
1420173 we havent viewed this as poaching but as part of natural career development
1420174 some of the technical and project management aspects of the job are very unfamiliar
1420175 there are some differences that have to be worked through especially as the attorneys take on roles concentrating on nuts and bolts discovery services and project management
1420176 if an attorney has five plus years experience is involved in groups like edd thinktank the sedona conference www thesedonaconference com and has a solid reputation the number can creep into 225 250k
1420177 a huge surge in corporations and law firms hiring attorneys as edd specialists right or wrong attorneys are often hired into this position because they are seen as having more credibility than paralegals or traditional non attorney litigation support professionals
1420178 no longer are our clients simply looking to us to assemble a review team
1420179 a number of our staff attorneys have become associates based on consistently excellent performance
1420180 tomorrow the work will go to india or parts similar because those positions there are well paying wellregarded career track positions rarely if ever is that the case here
1420181 does cause friction the litigation support staffers are all about getting work done the attorneys seem more interested in writing memos
1420182 a much more accepted career path for a lawyer than it was in the past
1420183 expected to be experts in e discovery or at a minimum have the ability to coordinate activities with vendors as well as educate attorneys on best practices
1420184 far more involvement in the front end of a matter especially as a project consultant
1420185 the more a paralegal gains expertise in the use of technology the more valuable he or she becomes for the organization
1420186 paralegals can no longer expect to be hired or promoted without technical skills database knowledge or a general comfort level navigating computers and new software
1420187 the grass isnt always greener but when there are so many options these professionals are choosing to find out for themselves
1420188 has been a massive challenge once on board keeping them is even harder the market keeps bidding the salary higher and higher most firms dont market adjust quickly enough
1420189 we have no poaching allowed signs on all the doors its not working
1420190 hiring recruiting retaining has become expensive going for five to six digit salaries in some cases the nature of litigation practice at loeb five years ago was very different from what it is today
1420191 the recruiters and competing vendors vultures and poachers are contacting employees
1420192 in todays market incompetent employees can bounce from job to job while increasing their compensation and title
1420193 for generation xs a career in a law firm was respectable and could be your end destination
1420194 an experience or a place to visit on their life journey rather than their end destination
1420195 the ability for a law firm to milk feed young or new staff on the smaller or less complex tasks is being compromised by the very nature of edd and transaction support the risk factor for law firms has never been higher when dealing with corporate information
1420196 there simply are not enough qualified edd personnel to go around
1420197 finding or teaching that balance between technology and the law it is critical that litigation support staff be able to convey often complicated technology issues to attorneys and their clients in easy to understand terms
1420198 increasingly relying on both litigation support professionals and tech savvy paralegals to help bridge the gap between it and legal
1420199 there is still a powerful echelon who think this will either go away or pass them by
1420200 lawyers are delegating too much substantive legal impact to junior lawyers paraprofessionals and vendors who end up dancing around blurred lines because the lawyers refuse to admit what they dont understand or expend the requisite effort to learn it this stuff isnt that hard but ive never seen anything that caused lawyers to get impatient grasp for half assed shortcuts and tune out quicker

1420220 because of this oraquick test way more people accept hiv testing than otherwise might
1420221 but if in fact there are more false positives than anticipated we need to be prepared
1420222 if were going to start widely testing in a population where there hasnt been wide testing before were going to have to be really careful to have accurate and robust testing
1420223 there are now a number of companies that are getting close to introducing a new generation of rapid tests
1420224 an internist may be the ideal person to initiate the hiv testing encounter and handle any potential false positive results but many people under the current health care system dont have that kind of provider
1420225 if we screen people and dont get them into care weve done little to help the patients
1420226 i have signed a decision to name a prosecutor for crimes in darfur from 2003 until now
1420227 i have given him the authority to investigate these crimes and go to a judge if he finds cases
1420228 this is too little too late no prosecutor or committee can do anything unless the sudan legal system is reformed
1420229 there is no mention in sudanese law of crimes such as genocide ethnic cleansing or war crimes so announcing this prosecutor or committee is just a media stunt

1420254 after hamas january 25 2006 electoral victory israel targeted gaza oppressively all outside aid was cut off sanctions and an economic embargo were imposed and the democratically elected government was falsely called a terrorist organization and isolated stepped up repression followed along with repeated idf incursions attacks killings targeted assassinations arrests destruction of property and more in a pattern all too familiar to palestinians for over six decades gazans are imprisoned in their own land and have been traumatized for months in june 2007 things got worse after israel placed the territory under siege described by some as medieval because of its extreme harshness
1420255 we want to break the siege of gaza we want to raise international awareness about the prison like closure of the gaza strip and pressure the international community to review its sanctions policy and end its support for continued israeli occupation we want to uphold palestines right to welcome internationals as visitors human rights observers humanitarian aid workers journalists or otherwise who are we we are these human rights observers aid workers and journalists we have years of experience volunteering in gaza and the west bank at the invitation of palestinians but now because of the increasing stranglehold of israels illegal occupation of palestine many of us find it almost impossible to enter gaza and an increasing number have been refused entry to israel and the west bank as well despite the great need for our work the israeli government will not allow us in to do it we are of all ages and backgrounds back home we are teachers medics musicians secretaries parents grandparents lawyers students activists actors playwrights politicians singer songwriters web designers international training consultants and even a former hollywood film industry worker and an aviator we are south african australian american english israeli palestinian and more

1420262 having a camera thats significantly lighter than other professional cameras makes a substantial difference at the end of a 12 hour shift we also needed cameras that are extremely rugged and reliable since we travel a lot with the roloffs
1420263 we spent two days testing all the top manufacturers cameras we recreated every situation that we imagined would happen in little people big world to really put these cameras to the test
1420264 we shoot in a variety of lighting conditions both day and night and encounter a lot of situations where were in a very high contrast or low light a lot of shooting takes places at night so we really looked for every opportunity to push each camera to see how they handled contrast and low light and to see how mobile each camera was
1420265 jvcs outstanding image quality and integration into our existing post production system were the deciding factors of all the cameras that we tested jvc produced the smoothest and sharpest image quality its a joy to use a true shoulder mount camera with an iris ring and interchangeable lens
1420266 the crew is constantly moving around quickly to stay in front of the family they spend a lot of time shooting on their knees to capture the roloffs at eye level and with the conditions we shoot in it really helps to have cameras that are physically manageable
1420267 we take between 15 40 cases of equipment at a time so the cameras are constantly getting broken down and set back up weve even put the cameras in extreme weather for a shoot we did in iowa in minus 20 degree temperatures so weve shot in both hot and cold temperatures and that hasnt caused any problem with the cameras
1420268 the combination of the fujinon wide angles lens and the focus enhancements firestore drive counterbalances the camera perfectly ive shot a variety of shows and documentary films and have used many different cameras jvcs camera in terms of hand held shooting is fantastic both in balance and operation but most importantly is its weight because at the end of the day when you have a camera thats fully loaded with batteries and drives at 12 13 pounds versus a camera coming in at 24 pounds your physical stamina isnt completely spent so your creative energy can be called on
1420269 through all the conditions and traveling we do jvcs cameras still produce a beautiful image the color reproduction is rich and the frame rate has very little strobing with motion unlike other professional cameras that weve used in the past its a pleasure to shoot with a real professional camera that has interchangeable lenses and allows you to have a surprising amount of control over the blacks and gamma settings

1420290 part of the coming out process is figuring out who you like and what that means and how to act on it
1420291 i couldnt just go to some bar and walk in and ask someone out on a date

1420294 im a big proponent of monogamous relationships regardless of sexuality and im proud of how the nation is steering toward that
1420295 well yes i think it is i come from a moral background and i can see the power of the show and imagine my old school teachers cringing or my grandparents thinking oh my god when they see me say having sex on a barstool but you have to remember this is not a reality show its supposed to be pure entertainment
1420296 making an instruction manual telling teens how to drink and do drugs or have sex were just laying out how it is
1420297 my character is very conflicted and even in the episodes where hes having sex then dumping girls theres often regret
1420298 you know there are repercussions to certain sorts of behavior that come full circle
1420299 i never actually said i disliked having my top off it was just that on that occasion it didnt make sense

1420303 i guess some people assume theres a seed of truth to it people think where theres smoke theres fire
1420304 weight on my conscience and why his former schoolteachers and grandparents could get uncomfortable watching him on gossip girl and that chace sometimes draws the limit about taking his clothes off but hes right you have to choose your battles etc

1420324 we receive thousands of phone calls each year about cms at the american cancer society acs national cancer information center and our web pages on cm are among the most popular on our website
1420325 the very large number of randomly chosen volunteers in the acs studies of cancer survivors and the availability of personal medical and psychological information provided an opportunity to study this topic in very precise detail and in some new ways
1420326 one result we find especially interesting is the substantial differences in use of cms by gender and type of cancer
1420327 although the consequences of infant and childhood excess body weight may seem to manifest in later years this perception is inaccurate
1420328 our findings indicate a need to intervene during these critical years by adopting proper eating habits and active lifestyles
1420329 the study has underlined the potential effect of the timing at exposure of sexual and body growth variables on the risk of prostate cancer
1420330 thus it is uncertain whether all study subjects had truly unexplained pain

1420355 it is one of the most difficult things in all the world for people who are not familiar with the ministry of healing to comprehend that the spirit of god is tangible actual a living quantity just as real as electricity just as real as any other native force yea and a great deal more so the life principle that stands behind all manifestations of life everywhere
1420356 benjamin franklin believed he could bottle electricity he had a conception that it was real and tangible and could be handled he believed that the lightning was the same as electricity so he made a kite and attached a key to the string with his hand he drew a spark from the key the result of this experiment revolutionized the world men began to study the laws of electricity and to apply them jesus christ came to reveal the laws of the spirit and to apply them in the heart of god there is a dynamic a power which is great enough to save every man in the world to heal every sick person in the world to heal them of anything of any degree of sin or any degree of sickness to raise the dead bless god
1420357 so through his life through his death through his resurrection from the dead step by step he went to the throne of god and presented himself and received from the father the gift of the holy ghost

1420420 but if a horse does have thumps there is usually an underlying cause that needs to be treated
1420421 typically these patients are dehydrated and have low blood calcium levels
1420422 but once you treat the underlying problem the thumps usually disappear on their own

1420424 one of the biggest challenges in the fight against influenza is producing new vaccines every year

1420432 for good reasons many pension schemes still have significant investments in equities but their volatility creates considerable uncertainty for their sponsoring companies

1420434 we appreciate each members willingness to serve on the leadership committee
1420435 they represent a broad spectrum of k staters around the country and their willingness to share their time talents and resources are essential for a successful campaign

1420441 service providers use goods to perform operations on a particular client such as haircuts or eye exams or on his property or possessions such as lawn care or computer repair
1420442 manufacturers almost always give away these services to enhance selling their goods
1420443 while commodities are fungible goods tangible and services intangible experiences are memorable
1420444 manufactures must focus on the experience customers have while using their goods
1420445 we live here games third places and the information architecture of the future
1420446 these developments make life much more convenient and in some ways much better we all seek to reduce our exposure to uninvited noise and many of us like to read opinions we find congenial
1420447 if they want to isolate themselves and speak only with like minded others that is feasible too
1420448 providing context through a shared information source is important because without it people lack a common reference point with which to engage in discussion

1420497 after consultations with senior women leaders he decided to assign important responsibilities to bakhtawar
1420498 mr zardari will make announcement about bakhtawar s participation in the politics soon

1420528 given what we have learned in the intervening years the use of work teams has become even more prevalent
1420529 consider a surgical team where one role performs the surgical procedures another assists the surgeon and yet another provides and monitors anesthesia though the assistant and anesthetist are important to the teams success it is the surgeon who has the central role
1420530 our contention is that the structure of a team consists of different roles and that some are more important than others
1420531 while other positional players especially the hitters who produce runs are important to the teams success they are not considered core role holders
1420532 teaming is very much a staffing question but it starts with determining roles to be filled and then selecting the right people to perform those roles and that is managements responsibility
1420533 we suggest that when creating a team organizations shift the focus onto core roles rather than the individual composition of the team
1420534 what we often see is a lack of understanding of what produces a successful team
1420535 it is hard to diagnose the anemia of chronic disease
1420536 having an assay for hepcidin would make it much easier and it would also help in diagnosing iron overload diseases
1420537 the assay can be used to easily measure hepcidin in the blood of all vertebrates
1420538 unexpressed concerns can keep patients from accepting recommended surgeries that may be very beneficial for them
1420539 if patients dont bring up concerns with their orthopaedic surgeon then the opportunity to help is missed for example if a patients unexpressed concern is based on incorrect information a surgeon will be hard pressed to help
1420540 our study also found that many patients do not mention worries about their capacity to meet the demands of surgery especially in the post operative period likely thinking that the surgeon cannot help but orthopaedic surgeons may be able to direct patients to social workers and other professional staff who can
1420541 patients are individuals not the left shoulder in room 2 but sometimes orthopaedic surgeons become so technically focused that we forget to develop that necessary personal relationship
1420542 about 20 to 30 percent of patients who undergo a knee or hip replacement end up having someone else do the surgery because they didnt feel a personal connection was established in that first meeting with the orthopaedic surgeon
1420543 improved communication skills can be learned and even small changes can make a big difference
1420544 this research strongly supports our programs emphasis on specific techniques that allow us to be more empathetic with our patients since the average orthopaedic surgeon sees 160 000 patients during his or her career aaos communicaton skills workshops can have a significant impact on patient care
1420545 is there something else you want to talk about today
1420546 there are potential therapeutic benefits associated with simply allowing for the expression of these concerns
1420547 listening to our patients demonstrates a willingness on the part of the surgeon to engage in a dialogue with patients that supports their decision making
1420548 simply offering some empathy and reassurance can go a long way in easing a patients concerns about surgery
1420549 stood a step above in terms of originality material and quality congrats to the 1 000 grand prize winner
1420550 no matter how much stone ground whole grain bread a person eats nothing compares to a slice of gummy white bread oozing peanut butter and dripping jelly

1420560 this was particularly important when stating facts about a recent historic event such as the wars of the former republic of yugoslavia which were a matter of political controversy
1420561 the comment on the destruction of the mostar bridge in which it was stated that there was no reason for the destruction was inaccurate
1420562 could have done more to have highlighted serbias role in the conflict

1420573 the content industry in suing cablevision once again overreached in its goal to limit the personal uses of increasingly popular technology
1420574 we hope this case will be another signal to hollywood to scale back its attacks on consumer friendly technologies
1420575 cablevision has no control over what programs are made available on individual channels or when those programs will air if at all
1420576 in this respect cablevision possesses far less control over recordable content than it does in the vod context where it actively selects and makes available beforehand the individual programs available for viewing
1420577 the cable companies have done just about all they can to damage tivo by keeping them outside the fraternity
1420578 people who are buying tivo are doing it despite all the obstacles the cable tv companies are putting in front of them and i dont think this will much change that

1420633 la ley de procedimiento administrativo fija un plazo de seis meses para resolver este tipo de concursos y se ala que transcurrido ese plazo podr n interpretar el silencio administrativo como la desestimaci n de las peticiones la consejer a entiende que en este caso excepcional no se puede considerar que exista ese silencio puesto que tanto el consejero del rea como el resto de cargos p blicos del gobierno auton mico con responsabilidades en la materia se han referido en numerosas ocasiones y de forma p blica a las dificultades en la revisi n de tan cuantiosos expedientes y a la firme decisi n del gobierno de resolver dicho concurso a la mayor brevedad posible
1420634 ante el esfuerzo que est realizando el personal responsable de la tramitaci n del concurso la consejer a no puede m s que considerar inaceptable e irresponsable la actitud del partido socialista canario que una vez m s emplea la pol tica sesgada para tratar de dar una imagen de incompetencia y de falta de seriedad de los responsables del gobierno auton mico y los funcionarios de la administraci n p blica canaria
1420635 que los dirigentes del partido socialista sigan insinuando que el primer concurso de asignaci n de potencia e lica se anul por presuntas corruptelas cuando es un hecho p blico y f cilmente comprensible para cualquier jurista que la anulaci n de dicho concurso se debi a una tramitaci n err nea del decreto que lo sustentaba al entender el gobierno de aquel entonces que no era necesario el informe previo del consejo consultivo de canarias

1420638 the pain was not allowing him to be effective in our eyes nor his
1420639 we gave him monday off to sort through it as you kind of build up to what you expect to happen in a year then it doesnt necessarily go like that

1420659 september 11 has become the catch all excuse for virtually every proposed expansion of government power
1420660 one example is a national identification card and data base long desired by some in government and which was mandated by legislation passed by the congress in 2005 with the support of both senators mccain and obama although i was no longer in the congress when this bad legislation was passed i had vigorously opposed it in the years since it became law just as i led the successful effort to rescind a previous mandate for a national id card
1420661 the real id act establishes a new and privacy invasive national id card program by forcing states to standardize their drivers licenses and creating a vast national data base of private information on the citizenry the law establishes through the back door something americans would never have accepted directly a national identification card
1420662 there was no open and honest vote on real id the mandate was slipped into a supplemental appropriations bill discouraging any real debate over the issue
1420663 creating anything close to a national id card threatens americans basic civil liberties and privacy while doing little or nothing to make us more secure
1420664 means higher fees longer lines and greater inconvenience for americans getting a drivers license the burden on states which have to redesign and remake state licenses and include all manner of information on citizens applying for new drivers licenses would be extremely high and immensely costly since they would have to restructure computer databases security systems verification measures and more
1420665 tougher government reforms than any other candidate in this race reforms that would eliminate the kind of no bid contracts that this administration has given to blackwater
1420666 most contractors act as if the law doesnt apply to them under my plan if contractors break the law they will be prosecuted
1420667 we have to crack down on private contractors like blackwater because i dont believe they should be able to run amok and put our own troops in danger and get paid three or four times or ten times what our soldiers are getting paid
1420668 we just end up seeing it on a billboard somewhere
1420669 but i think that its smart and its fine and its cool
1420670 everybody keeps saying theyre so racy of course theyre racy but you say theyre smart
1420671 i say bass hole i say something else but its all chuck bass related
1420672 in the event that i am reincarnated i would like to return as a deadly virus in order to contribute something to solve overpopulation

1420674 a total world population of 250 300 million people a 95 decline from present levels would be ideal
1420675 in order to stabilize world population it is necessary to eliminate 350 000 people a day it is a horrible thing to say but its just as bad not to say it
1420676 investing in contraception would help in the fight against climate change doctors should help to bring family size into the arena of environmental ethics

1420691 nunca se hab an registrado tantos desembarcos en lampedusa como hasta ahora
1420692 quiz alquien pensaba que bastaba exhibir los m sculos y lanzar amenazas de nuevos delitos como el de la inmigraci n clandestina para resolver el problema
1420693 lo que se pone de manifiesto en relaci n con los modelos ling sticos es que hay un tripartido enfrentado y dividido
1420694 mecanismos para que todo lo que hace referencia a cuestiones tan importantes como la educaci n se haga desde el m ximo consenso y acuerdo no s lo en el seno del tripartito sino como ven amos reclamando los socialistas con un consenso m s amplio y transversal con los principales grupos de la oposici n
1420695 lo primero que tenemos que conseguir es una buena educaci n par nuestros ni os y educarlos en conocimiento pero tambi n en valores ticos y democr ticos
1420696 como instrumento de adoctrinamiento de determinadas ideolog as en este caso de la ideolog a nacionalista
1420697 las reclamaciones que estamos haciendo los socialistas desde hace tiempo en relaci n con lo que hay que hacer en nuestro modelo educativo tambi n ahora el propio pnv entiende que hay que buscar no s lo la flexibilidad como dice sino tambi n acuerdos amplios
1420698 cada vez que se ha abordado una reforma sobre nuestro modelo educativo gobernara quien gobernara siempre se ha intentado hacer desde el m ximo consenso y acuerdo
1420699 esta vez nosotros vamos a seguir reclamando que no se instrumentalice la educaci n y que todas las mejoras o cambios que se tengan que hacer en nuestro modelo educativo se hagan desde el m ximo acuerdo y consenso
1420700 llevan desde hace tiempo planificando toda su actividad en el horizonte de las pr ximas elecciones auton micas
1420701 lo que tendr a que hacer el gobierno es ocuparse de los principales problemas del pa s y de buscar los consensos en aquellas cuestiones b sicas para construir pa s desde el entendimiento y el acuerdo
1420702 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1420703 made time to go the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops seems the pentagon wouldnt allow him to bring cameras
1420704 the strategy behind all this isnt hard to discern drive up obamas negatives and render him unacceptable to pivotal voting blocs thus the depiction of him as too young too feckless and too pampered to be president the portrayal of him as precious self infatuated and effete and the emphasis on obamas rock star persona designed to engender envy and contempt among the swath of middle america for which hipness is no virtue but a sign of pretension
1420705 as peter hart a democrat who conducts the wall street journal poll with republican neil newhouse puts it
1420706 to many americans obama is still a stranger an exotic and mysterious stranger with an odd name a dark face a weird pastor a cheeky wife and a brief past
1420707 in the short term they have to try to define him barack obama as someone who thinks hes above everyone else
1420708 there has been a very intentional effort to paint him as somebody outside the mainstream other hes not one of us
1420709 i think the mccain campaign has been scrupulous about not directly saying it but its the subtext of this campaign
1420710 been struck by how many people he has spoken to over the past few weeks candidates councillors and activists alike who appear to be either demoralised or disenchanted with cleggs leadership
1420711 i didnt even know a majority of these places existed and i grew up in this town
1420712 hang your wet suit and towel on the deck rail

1420714 in a time of hype telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
1420715 but rather despoiled landscapes where industry and the wild overlap
1420716 shows how the human body is meant to be a participant in these grand constructions
1420717 esto denota una falta de coordinaci n entre los diferentes actores responsables del manejo de la descontaminaci n del r o bogot as como del dise o de una pol tica clara que ha permitido el despilfarro de los dineros p blicos
1420718 the axis brazil argentina venezuela is the vertebral column of south america it is the triangle that articulates the region geopolitically which does not mean that it is the most important one
1420719 there is not a better way to fight against it than with a real integration integration in every aspect geopolitical financial food geo energy that is the only way we can guarantee the greater amount of happiness to our people
1420720 the accelerated dynamic resulting from the commitment of be united makes us to keep holding strategic meetings to carry out concrete actions
1420721 i am sure that we will walk towards a lasting relation

1420726 no memoirist who has more skillfully used journalistic tools to reconstruct his own life

1420730 there was an idea that it would be really cool to have an all led venue
1420731 it was a cool idea but its just not extremely practical
1420732 we are using the strip lights as a backwash on the brick wall at the southern its a scenic element a little cool a little different we also brought in two moving lights and are running it on a moving light board
1420733 the fringe is different because it is unlike any other experience youre going to have in the theatre

1420735 in a time of hype telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
1420736 in a time of hype telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
1420737 twenty years ago 21 of oil contracts were purchased by speculators who trade oil on paper with no intention of ever taking delivery today oil speculators purchase 66 of all oil futures contracts and that reflects just the transactions that are known speculators buy up large amounts of oil and then sell it to each other again and again a barrel of oil may trade 20 plus times before it is delivered and used the price goes up with each trade and consumers pick up the final tab some market experts estimate that current prices reflect as much as 30 to 60 per barrel in unnecessary speculative costs
1420738 in a time of hype telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
1420739 we will hit those points in a few years and that will help in many ways
1420740 we just have to survive through this part of the cycle
1420741 more delinquencies look like they are on the horizon because so few of them have reset

1420743 when mr bush took office he predicted that federal debt held by the public the amount borrowed by the government to pay for past deficits would shrink to just 8 percent of the gross domestic product in 2009 he now estimates that it will amount to 40 percent
1420744 this is going to make it extraordinarily difficult for whoevers going to become president
1420745 i dont care who the president is when they come and meet with their secretary of the treasury the federal reserve chairman their top economists it will be a sobering moment
1420746 its hard to see how we could spend less on the military in the near term
1420747 there were some irresponsible decisions that were made on wall street and in washington in the past few years i think we learned an essential truth that in the long run we cant have a thriving wall street if we dont have a thriving main street
1420748 no estamos contentos con el nivel de progresos alcanzados tenemos que hacer que los gobiernos y los donantes rindan m s cuentas de lo que hacen y dicen
1420749 no hemos tenido xito en politizar el cond n femenino

1420772 jorge es una de las personas m s comprometidas con las que he trabajado estoy profundamente impresionado por su firme decisi n de marcar la diferencia en la lucha contra el sida
1420773 a las personas que piensan eso les digo que miren los n meros de la epidemia en m xico
1420774 desde hace alg n tiempo sabemos que la expansi n del tratamiento puede ayudar a disminuir las infecciones por vih sin embargo nos sorprende el elevado n mero de nuevos casos que se podr an evitar
1420775 a pesar de que se ha incrementado enormemente el n mero de opciones para el tratamiento del vih en todo el mundo a n no nos hemos librado de la epidemia necesitamos utilizar todas las opciones de prevenci n que tengamos al alcance y de una vez para siempre unir la terapia con la prevenci n y no pensar en ambas por separado esto es esencial para lograr el m ximo beneficio de la comunidad en el cuidado del vih
1420776 los resultados de este estudio deber an ayudar a reactivar y mantener la expansi n de los programas antirretrovirales en todo el mundo
1420777 de acuerdo con las experiencias pasadas el aumento de los programas de tratamiento ser un reto importante y dif cil de llevar a cabo
1420778 todav a hay millones de personas que necesitan los f rmacos tenemos dos a os para lograr el acceso universal este trabajo muestra por qu debemos trabajar m s para lograr esta meta el tratamiento como herramienta de prevenci n representa una oportunidad nica pero debemos tener en cuenta que la terapia necesita ser parte de un enfoque integral no tiene sentido tener un programa de tratamiento antirretroviral efectivo en comunidades africanas por ejemplo si no se han atendido al mismo tiempo los problemas de nutrici n y seguridad alimenticia
1420779 many people are worried about biofuels contributing to deforestation and air pollution in the name of protecting the planet

1420789 habr a una gran reducci n en la distribuci n de las lluvias que produce la amazonia en varias regiones de am rica del sur
1420790 efectivamente lo m s r pido que se debe hacer para evitar ese escenario es parar la deforestaci n
1420791 ser a necesario un conjunto de pol ticas p blicas que claramente el gobierno solo este gobierno el gobierno anterior ser a incapaz de tomar
1420792 para eso se necesita aumentar el presupuesto del ministerio de medio ambiente del ibama instituto brasile o de medio ambiente y del instituto chico mendes
1420793 sin financiamiento de ilegalidades en la amazonia ya se asegura una buena parte del problema
1420794 sin ese mecanismo va a ser muy dif cil que consigamos evitar procesos de cambios dr sticos en la vegetaci n amaz nica

1420815 neither taught nor knew of anything like what these heretics rave about
1420816 the ecclesiastical tradition from the apostles and the preaching of the truth have come down to us and this is the most abundant proof that there is one and the same vivifying faith which has been preserved in the church from the apostles until now and handed down in truth

1420836 in the ancient world christianity was even more diverse than it was today
1420837 i suspect the gospel of judas was not one of the close calls in this process
1420838 beliefs prevalent in the two or three centuries after the death of jesus said the rev donald senior of the catholic theological union in chicago who was an adviser to the restoration team
1420839 the publication team appears to have done everything possible to authenticate the gospel as an ancient work
1420840 there seems to be little doubt that it is indeed a late third or early fourth century work and not a modern forgery
1420841 the gospel of judas is an astonishing discovery that along with dozens of similar texts have in recent years have transformed our understanding of early christianity
1420842 it is clear for example that judas did not write this work
1420843 he chose damnation rather than accepting gods forgiveness and that is our fate if we are so proud we think our sins are beyond gods reach
1420844 the view of judas as this evil jewish person who turned jesus in fed the flames of anti semitism

1420882 implements a new holiday to accommodate the muslim workers at the plant
1420883 the five year contract creates an additional paid holiday iidal fitil a muslim holiday that occurs toward the end of ramadan
1420884 the new contract includes eight paid holidays which is the same number provided in the old contract
1420885 however the union leadership did request and receive eid al fitr which is apparently spelled various ways including id al fitr and eid ul fitr as a paid holiday in place of labor day
1420886 since all team members will still have eight paid holidays the change will not affect production
1420887 is distinguished by the performance of communal prayer salat at daybreak on its first day it is a time of official receptions and private visits when friends greet one another presents are given new clothes are worn and the graves of relatives are visited
1420888 eid al fitr is one of eight paid holidays for all team members covered by the contract while labor day is not a paid holiday
1420889 based on the contract the other paid holidays include the team members birthday new years day martin luther king jr day memorial day independence day thanksgiving day and christmas day
1420890 implementing this holiday was a challenge since it falls on a different day every year and is declared on fairly short notice
1420891 but the negotiating committee felt this was extremely crucial since this holiday is as important to muslims as christmas is to christians
1420892 the date for this holiday eid al fitr is not the same each year
1420893 all team members who have completed their probationary period are eligible for all eight paid holidays including eid al fitr
1420894 two prayer rooms have been created to allow muslim workers to pray twice a day and return to work without leaving the plant
1420895 does have a prayer room to accommodate the needs of muslim team members
1420896 in addition to regular non paid breaks all team members are allotted a seven minute paid break

1420912 he turned to dick cheney and he told cheney go take care of this and cheney proceeded to meet with renewable energy groups once and met with the oil companies 40 times
1420913 john mccain has taken a page out of the bush cheney playbook hes offering a plan with no significant investments in alternative energy
1420914 while sen mccains plan wont save you at the pump any time soon i have to say this it sure has raised him a lot of campaign dollars
1420915 sen mccain raised more than 1 million from the oil industry just last month just last month most of which came after he announced his plan for offshore drilling to a roomful of oil executives
1420916 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1420917 solving our national energy crisis requires an all of the above approach
1420918 that will require aggressive development of alternative energies like wind solar tidal and bio fuels it also requires expanding traditional sources of energy like offshore drilling clean coal and nuclear power like the power produced at this plant here in michigan
1420919 it is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option however before an expansion of nuclear power is considered obama thinks key issues must be addressed including security of nuclear fuel and waste waste storage and proliferation
1420920 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
1420921 only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties

1420924 the message delivered today is not irans response to the six countries
1420925 what was given to solana was the telephone conversation transcript and not a response to the proposed package
1420926 if we are not going to receive a clear response a clear message from them we are going to have no choice but to pursue additional measures
1420927 so first we will see what happens with the rest of the day that is left in europe and then they will have their call tomorrow we will see where we go from there

1420932 after one president in the pocket of the oil companies we cant afford another
1420933 unfortunately in this election senator mccain has proposed an energy plan thats nothing but four years more of the same
1420934 hes offering a plan with no significant investments in alternative energy
1420935 a company that last quarter made the same amount of money in 30 seconds that a typical ohio worker makes in a year
1420936 and while senator mccains plan wont save you at the pump anytime soon it sure has done a lot to raise campaign dollars
1420937 because after one president in the pocket of the oil companies we cant afford another for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet we must end the age of oil in our time
1420938 but if we seize this moment and meet the challenge we can open to door to a new economy for the 21st century that will bring new energy new jobs and new hope to youngstown and communities across ohio and this nation
1420939 mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1420940 our economy is in turmoil i dont have to tell the people of youngstown
1420941 people here have known some hard knocks and hard times
1420942 i love his policies and his passion hes an example to my sons to not be afraid be willing to take a risk and to do it with respect for god and people
1420943 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet we must end the age of oil in our time
1420944 right now oil companies have access to 68 million acres where they arent drilling so we should start by giving them a choice use it or lose it use the land you have or give up your leases to someone who will
1420945 two and a half times what it cost when president bush took office
1420946 problem was it was the oil company plan it was the gas company plan we need a people plan and thats why im running for president
1420947 john mccain wants to talk about britney spears and paris hilton
1420948 thats his idea of a really relevant campaign but i dont have time to deal with that mess because americas facing some serious problems americas facing some serious challenges
1420949 instead of offering a real plan to lower gas prices the only energy plan that hes really promoting is more drilling
1420950 thats what he talked about yesterday i want to drill here i want to drill now i dont know where he was standing
1420951 the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1420952 four years more of oil companies calling the shots while hard working families are struggling
1420953 if you think about the midwest think about right here what weve got is all kind of towns that we could connect
1420954 all of these cities are they basically take in the air about 45 minutes to an hour to fly
1420955 take off your shoes get to the terminal realize that your flights been delayed two hours go pay 10 for a cup of coffee and a sandwich for another 10 come back you get on the plane youre sitting on the tarmac for another 25 minutes you finally take off youre circling above the city for another half hour when you land they cant find your luggage and then you get to where youre going by the time its all done its a five hour trip amp so the time is right now for us to start thinking about high speed rail as an alternative to air transportation connecting all these cities and think about what a great project that would be in terms of rebuilding america
1420956 when john mccains campaign goes out there and starts saying things like id rather lose a war to win an election or when he says that somehow i didnt want to visit the troops in germany even though every reporter says thats not true well youre not trying to solve problems
1420957 all youre trying to do is divide people so you can win an election thats nothing to be proud of lets have a real honest debate about policies that are going to make a difference in peoples lives
1420958 its not are you paranoid it is are you paranoid enough

1420988 american apparel is a cutting edge brand and its online advertising strategy clearly reflects that
1420989 using social media as the primary vehicle to drive its provocative ad campaigns has helped it build a strong presence among its core audience of young adults
1420990 apparel is one of the largest u s e commerce categories accounting for roughly 15 of total online retail sales
1420991 however some of the biggest retailers in the category are significantly underrepresented in the online display ad market

1420994 i am excited about our internet growth opportunities and i am confident our management team will continue to outperform the market
1420995 it is very difficult to speculate on what will happen to house prices over the next year or so
1420996 but it is perfectly true that our economy along with every other economy in the world is going to slow down and that slowdown is pretty dramatic in many places in relation to the housing market there is no doubt that a combination of peoples general mood and outlook and the fact that mortgage finance has been constrained is pushing prices down
1420997 i am looking at a number of measures and i am not going to be drawn on that today because we have not concluded what exactly we need to do it is helping people that is important i want to look at a range of options that will help people
1420998 it is a welcome initiative and shows that ministers appreciate the problems the current housing market situation is causing people looking to buy and sell properties and the impact it is having on the wider economy
1420999 the government shouldnt be trying to bribe people into buying houses in a falling market
1421000 with the economy grinding to a halt we are already likely to see a shortfall in taxation suspending stamp duty even on a temporary basis will only make this situation worse
1421001 this doesnt say much however as the reliability of the test results has always been too low to provide accurate comparisons between schools
1421002 while the reliability of the key stage 2 results has to be treated with a massive pinch of salt there is no evidence of a decline in standards despite this years chaos primary schools are doing well
1421003 should have taken the opportunity to ask lord sutherland to conduct a fundamental review of the entire flawed testing system
1421004 at the moment it is in the grass at the end of the runway at the far end away from the terminal near dinnington road
1421005 dinnington road is shut because of the radiation threat from the jets flare planes coming in have been diverted to durham tees valley or manchester airports

1421011 we have a close connection to them we learnt about them as children we see them in zoos we see them in films we see them in the wild if we go out to look at them

1421022 we get to go to a different place to make music for a month and that place happens to be the napa valley a working vacation hardly even captures the wonderful opportunity for us
1421023 if you look at the schedule of any orchestra it carves out an enormous chunk of ones time
1421024 youre always working a couple weeks ahead preparing music the learning curve of each weeks programs is so steep and so fast that by the end of a season theres a potential for burnout so to play under totally different ground rules is very liberating believe it or not its joyful work
1421025 i made decision that i wont go to any airports no traveling because i have to do it so much during the season
1421026 i have taken out my bicycle my motorcycle ive been jogging reading and didnt think about music at all for three weeks i was totally free of music and i feel really good right now
1421027 i love the freedom and i love the smells in the air
1421028 it lets me air my brain out its hard to explain but its a really nice feeling
1421029 ive done this since 1972 and ive never had a period of my life when i didnt have a motorcycle or one sort or another i just like to ride
1421030 although it takes a lot of energy strength and concentration its a different kind
1421031 and so then when i go back to rehearsals im refreshed

1421034 its pretty small definitely the smallest in the world in space for sure
1421035 i would tend to feel that a culinary background might actually inhibit things like chocolate manufacture because its sort of a different side of the business
1421036 youre dealing more as a mechanic or a factory worker than as a cook
1421037 theres people that have come back for more now more people are asking for it by name
1421038 my analysis on this is its tough to forecast what consumers will do
1421039 but there is always the possibility that customers will change and once they change habits its tough to bring them back

1421064 they tell us that the landscape has changed very little in 14 1 million years and that at the time the fossils lived the climate in this sector of antarctica was similar to that of southern south america today the organisms died out suddenly by 13 9 million years ago and since that time interior antarctica has been in a perpetual deep freeze with most of the interior ice remaining relatively stable and frozen the exact cause of this dramatic climatic shift one of the most significant over the last 65 million years remains unknown
1421065 mid miocene cooling and the extinction of tundra in continental antarctica
1421066 in addition to fossils of organisms that inhabited the lake we have recovered pollen and spores and a few macroscopic remains of plants and insects that inhabited the lake regions
1421067 everything about the fossil site from its geology to the fossils themselves tells us the climate shift was abrupt major and enduring its legacy continues to this day

1421078 na das mit unserer kleinen trauergesellschaft sie wollen uns ja wohl nicht in die gro e trauerhalle setzen oder
1421079 wir werden unser bestes tun ich melde mich deswegen noch bei ihnen
1421080 warum denn nicht gibt es den kleinen raum nicht mehr
1421081 schon abba datt war mal voll die schnapsidee von irgennem sesselfurzer man kommt mittem sarch nich umme ecke nich richtich wenigstens un gezz stehta ger mpel drin abba bis unterkante oberkiefer
1421082 das war doch eine idee von eurem leitenden verwaltungsdirektor abteilung friedhofswesen herrn m gel pers nlich
1421083 nein nein das brauchen sie nicht ich habe schon mit herrn verwaltungsdirektor m gel gesprochen und der hat mir was ganz phantastisches angeboten warum bieten sie mir denn den kleinen raum auf dem friedhof nicht an der ist doch extra vor einiger zeit f r kleine trauerfamilien errichtet worden herr m gel war auch ganz erstaunt hat mir dann aber gesagt da die gewerblichen bestatter sich da nicht so auskennen
1421084 sie kurze info f r sie es kommt doch noch eine abordnung von der bruderschaft meines mannes und auch aus der familie m tterlicherseits kommen noch einige wir werden so an die 75 personen sein es k nnen aber auch weitaus mehr werden man wei ja nie wer da alles kommt wir hatten ja eine ganzseitige anzeige in der zeitung und die seite daneben war ja voll die uni das institut die h here gesellschaft von 1871 und noch viele andere hochgestellte institutionen sie machen das nicht wahr
1421085 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1421086 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1421087 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1421088 as it turns out big oils most successful speculating wasnt in the oil fields it was in washington where they invested millions in john mccain and got their moneys worth
1421089 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1421090 barack obamas latest negative attack ad shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy
1421091 huge crowds and mostly favourable press reviews of obamas overseas trip have been trumped by mccains attacks on obama
1421092 loss of support for obama among young voters may also be due to his perceived reversals on issues they care about such as the war and government eavesdropping

1421094 at first we had no idea what it was it could have been in our solar system or at the edge of the universe
1421095 we think that in the recent past the galaxy ic 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar
1421096 because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the voorwerp light from that past still lights up the nearby voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100 000 years and the galaxys black hole itself has gone quiet
1421097 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
1421098 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
1421099 the strange hannys voorwerp looks like it could be the nearest example of a luminous quasar
1421100 ic 2497 is so close that if the quasar was still shining today on a good night you could probably see it with a small telescope
1421101 the nearest active quasar called 3c 273 is 1 7 billion light years further away
1421102 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
1421103 hannys attentiveness alerted us not only to a peculiar object but to a window into the cosmic past which might have eluded us for a long time otherwise trying to understand the processes operating here has proven to be a fascinating challenge involving a whole range of astrophysical techniques and instruments around the world and beyond this has also been some of the most rewarding astronomy ive done in years
1421104 when we launched galaxy zoo we were overwhelmed as was the internet portal initially with the outpouring of public interest and volunteer input
1421105 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
1421106 it was a fantastic present to find out on my 25th birthday that we will get observational time on the hubble space telescope to follow up this discovery
1421107 this study demonstrates how remedial instruction can use the plasticity of the human brain to gain an educational improvement
1421108 focused instruction can help underperforming brain areas to increase their proficiency
1421109 any kind of education is a matter of training the brain when poor readers are learning to read a particular brain area is not performing as well as it might and remedial instruction helps to shape that area up
1421110 this finding shows that poor readers can be helped to develop buff brains a similar approach should apply to other skills
1421111 we are at the beginning of a new era of neuro education
1421112 the last 10 to 15 years have seen particularly dangerous declines in rainfall in sensitive ecosystems in east africa such as somalia and eastern ethiopia
1421113 we wanted to know if the trend would continue or if it would start getting wetter
1421114 we can be quite certain that the decline in rainfall has been substantial and will continue to be
1421115 this 15 percent decrease every 20 25 years is likely to continue
1421116 it sounds good to tom so its ok with me
1421117 while adolescent african american females remain a high risk group for stds little research has examined their marijuana use sexual behaviors and incidence of std infection
1421118 although no differences in condom use were identified between marijuana users and non users results suggest that marijuana users are engaging in sexual acts with riskier partners and under riskier circumstances and had higher rates of stds
1421119 our long term goal should be to alter our lifestyle accordingly beginning in infancy or early childhood
1421120 instituting a low saturated fat low cholesterol diet in infancy 7 months is perfectly safe without adverse effects
1421121 our review of the literature convinces us that more aggressive and earlier intervention will probably prevent considerably more than 30 of coronary heart disease
1421122 studies show that fatty streak lesions in the arteries that are a precursor to atherosclerosis and heart disease begin in childhood and advanced lesions are not uncommon by age 30 why not nip things in the bud
1421123 the weapons for those wars education and behavior modification are the same as those needed for a war on coronary heart disease
1421124 the mandarins american foreign policy brought to you by china
1421125 one of the reasons im going is because i want to show respect to the chinese people and this is a proud moment for china
1421126 who in the world could have felt offended while seeing tiepolos nude depicting truth its sheer folly
1421127 its so sad one cannot hide truth a subject which has been portrayed in the nude for centuries
1421128 the entire history of renaissance art and the period that followed is full of nudes
1421129 its not funny when one thinks of what is aired on canale 5
1421130 this years class reveals an empowered group of consumers from their purchasing decisions and media consumption to their pull at the polls this college consumer is clearly in control and showing their strength in numbers
1421131 perception of social responsibility remains critical to garnering college students brand loyalty in current collegiate environment it is very cool to be good brands who sic enable college students to reflect their own social responsibility by association have an advantage
1421132 the digital revolution on campus shows no signs of slowing students have come to expect 24 7 connectedness and mobility now flexibility and ease of function to socialize communicate and be entertained is what theyre demanding
1421133 with college students quickly and easily adopting new technologies enabling a constant desire to engage and connect the study gives marketers more than just a glimpse into students media behaviors but also an essential view into finding their way in
1421134 the equipment and the house it was in was protected by kyrgyz authorities
1421135 this is an unfortunate situation that we hope will be rectified soon
1421136 je ne veux pas parler de cela ce dossier est clos termin termin termin il jouera ici la saison prochaine vous pouvez me croire
1421137 est la premi re recrue de cette ann e et s rement la seule
1421138 est ansioso por que se le d el alta lo antes posible

1421140 m s apasionada que el cine habitual de allen por varios grados
1421141 quiero que la gente vea el romance y quer a algunas risas
1421142 quer a ver a dos mujeres j venes que van a barcelona y las cosas gradualmente comienzan a desintegrarse
1421143 it wouldnt be how we understand the operation functioning no doubt we can clear up the matter quickly
1421144 my face was pushed into the ground my arm was twisted and i was hit two or three times in the face
1421145 this is utterly unacceptable any time its particularly reprehensible just days before the olympics at a time when china has promised complete media freedom
1421146 fulfill its olympic bid commitments to increase access to information and expand freedom of the press
1421147 the japanese reporters violated the rules of china by forcing their way into a military area the act was not well justified and they should accept the consequences
1421148 i however apologize to the reporters as the top regional public security official for the clash they had with the border policemen
1421149 a set of clear and rigorous principles such that restrictive governments would be unable to ignore or reject these best practices on freedom of expression and the protection of individual privacy
1421150 this code of conduct would be one important step toward our shared goals of promoting freedom of expression and protecting the privacy of internet users around the world
1421151 any sensitive personal information regarding american athletes journalists and tourists who use the internet while they are in china during the olympics other than required by united states law
1421152 nobody does seedy better than americans and i mean that in a good way

1421164 these songs and their catchy ass hooks have been stuck in my mind for the better part of the last decade and a half
1421165 and the kids have even broadened their interests to include the production of films and their own
1421166 printed on it and acted similar to a hip hop hype man or
1421167 or threatening to deliver something along the lines of an
1421168 the next song they performed was a song from the album
1421169 around this point everything started to gel for me as a much larger picture
1421170 transformed into a very meaningful and powerful awareness and it snuck up on me
1421171 life without the cow in much the same way that
1421172 i can agree with these statements but i do believe that there is even more to it
1421173 profound messages are woven in their dialogue and mannerism relating to relationships egotism and how we treat one another
1421174 and have their own accomplishments that are equally amazing as anyone else
1421175 of widney high but they are growing and have become adults in their own right who do things that other adults enjoy
1421176 well probably see a break for a couple of hours through the late morning and early afternoon
1421177 they woke up this morning and saw the chairs in the pool so that was pretty interesting
1421178 he said wed be ok once the storm passed over
1421179 but when we got here and saw people boarding up the windows my wife got a little nervous
1421180 long time readers of this weblog will recall i have always been a
1421181 this is what kentucky proud is all about forging partnerships and helping kentucky producers find markets for their products
1421182 this partnership will help many kentucky farmers make a living on the farm
1421183 you let the musician play a great while before you throw him down money because you love to hear this music
1421184 well i dont know i guess were gonna have to talk about that
1421185 i was told that playing in green bay was not an option i do want to play football again yes i do now where i want to play it is a different question not in green bay if they dont want me to play here then give me my release and let me play somewhere else
1421186 oh my bad of course you can come back and play brett i dont know what we were thinking
1421187 im very pleased that duke energys core operations continue to perform well despite challenging conditions caused by volatile fuel prices and economic uncertainty
1421188 despite this difficult environment with our focus on executing our plans we are positioned for continued success
1421189 es grave que integrantes de las fuerzas armadas filtren noticias de manera clandestina y sin coordinaci n con sus superiores adem s es grave que en las primeras investigaciones sobre la operaci n no haya salido a relucir toda la verdad
1421190 la necesidad de permitir que todos los medios de comunicaci n tengan igual y
1421191 en alusi n a las cr ticas por la entrega del material a un canal televisivo en concreto
1421192 de la cruz roja se al el ministro en san jos del guaviare capital del departamento del guaviare en el sur del pa s el ministro de defensa record que el d a de la operaci n las fuerzas militares hab an asegurado que
1421193 esa fue la verdad que se nos dijo el v deo de ayer demuestra que la realidad era diferente el logo del cicr se utiliz desde el comienzo de la operaci n lamentamos mucho que eso haya sucedido
1421194 no hay mejor garant a para la libertad que la seguridad
1421195 el deber de los gobiernos es garantizar la seguridad de los ciudadanos es muy importante que todos apoyen esa lucha para combatir la delincuencia

1421215 the statute requires the candidates to demonstrate judgment integrity and objectivity
1421216 these are qualities that these nominees have demonstrated during their professional careers
1421217 well i really dont need to drive to the store right now
1421218 i know that somehow theres a release that suggests there was a stall but we havent come to any of those conclusions
1421219 our investigators have been on the site and well be trying to get the wreckage off the hillside today
1421220 we know the weather was suitable for the flight to depart
1421221 however i believe we have the engines and propeller pieces that well be able to examine more closely
1421222 we can tell already that there was power at least in one of the engines and we have to look closer to determine the level of power in the other engine
1421223 initially we were receiving text messages from rcc the rescue centre in victoria from bob on the ground
1421224 it was a very big part of us having a successful mission
1421225 hes getting a bit stiffer and sorer as would be expected given the nature of the accident that he had but hes doing fine
1421226 you hope above hope that its going to be your family member
1421227 we were pretty ecstatic when we found out bob was still alive
1421228 and what happens is if you drive in the city you actually clean the air usually in the downtown of the city the air is a little more polluted
1421229 the car is so exclusive that the bmw representative couldnt even give us a price
1421230 only hydrogen fuel won from renewable sources such as sun wind water and biomass can provide a reduction in total co2 emissions and meet our energy needs in a sustainable way
1421231 after working an entire workday on the friday of the rotation mr walsh was required to remain on call twenty four hours a day from friday evening until monday morning when he would report to the employers work site for his regular workday without compensation
1421232 the smaller the number and the more specific the better
1421233 981 ideas updates and pieces youll reach for all season
1421234 two went in saturday and so there was no more rehearsals and today sunday all the rehearsals were called off
1421235 the kids are completely dehydrated two of them im sure theyre doing a lot of blood work to see if theres anything else
1421236 the other two could not rehearse as well and so hopefully everybody is going to be in the same boat hopefully everybody will be refreshed by having a full day off
1421237 happy to be in the midst of so many asian babes
1421238 in fact im happy that the podium covers me from the waist down
1421239 like a dress on a beautiful woman long enough to cover the important parts and short enough to keep your interest like my colleague jujus
1421240 upon reflection it was a tasteless remark that i now bitterly regret
1421241 i dont walk out of the house thinking man i hope somebody thinks this looks cool theres some stuff i wear that people think is not cool
1421242 with every piece i have to ask myself would i wear it and then i have to ask myself would a million other people wear it
1421243 queremos mostrar o ltimo adeus ao povo da terra em que ele nasceu
1421244 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1421245 consumers companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information
1421246 the ad comes after democratic rival sen barack obama made a point of including images of mccain with bush in his last two ads hitting the republican on his energy policy
1421247 these constituents have the intelligence and they should have the free will to do this there are three candidates vying for the opportunity to serve but with this resolution this body is taking it upon itself to personally eliminate one of these candidates
1421248 this is absolutely everything for me but the arbat will lose more what is this place without the people who bring it to life
1421249 they dont have receipts and they fake their prices it really surprises me they lasted this long
1421250 it didnt need doing and the new stuff is very similar
1421251 we understand that the european court has today ordered that abu hamzas extradition should be stayed while it considers his appeal against extradition to the u s
1421252 the decision is a matter for the european court the u k cannot extradite hamza while the court has ordered his extradition to be stayed
1421253 and the gold medal for the marathon goes to the turtle
1421254 we both fear and love the idea that somehow our genomes are us that everything about us is defined by this long sequence of as cs gs and ts you know its just not true for most of us the events that have happened during our lifetimes our parents efforts for us the friends weve made the jobs weve had the good and bad luck weve had thats more important in who we are than what genes were born with and thats really important to remember
1421255 thats why genetic tests wont be able to tell us if are going to get a disease all they can tell us again with some rare exceptions is whether or not statistically we are slightly more or slightly less likely to get a disease than the average person
1421256 you are more likely than average to get lung cancer if you keep smoking
1421257 intelligence is partly hereditary a meta analysis by bernie devlin of the university of pittsburgh found that genes account for about 48 percent of the differences in i q scores
1421258 there are no genetic factors that can be studied independently of the environment and there are no environmental factors that function independently of the genome phenotype emerges only from the interaction of gene and environment the search for main effects is a fools errand in the context of modem molecular biology it is a quest that is without credibility
1421259 everything we have learned about molecular biology has shown that gene activity is regulated by the intracellular environment the intracellular environment is a function of the genetic make up of the cell and the extracellular environment which is also influenced by the environment of the individual
1421260 its not a guaranteed recipe to create exactly the individual capabilities we desire but it is a plan to nudge all of humanity in the right direction
1421261 the it the greatness is something you acquire not something you are given or are not given
1421262 your older sibling really is smarter study says more time with adults a likely factor some say
1421263 frank sulloway a uc berkeley professor and birth order expert who wrote an accompanying commentary for science noted that the difference in iq between the oldest child and siblings was a measly 2 3 points
1421264 the myth that we are all born with a certain intelligence intelligence
1421265 replacing our old recycled pillows and blankets with this state of the art high quality take home kit is an eco conscious health conscious and customer conscious decision
1421266 the notion that immigrants should adapt to america is being destroyed one aclu approved muslim foot washing bath at a time
1421267 regarding the issue of the burgeoning rate of muslim immigrants to canada weinstein declares that some kind of form must be signed that prohibits entry into canada of people that believe in the muslim brotherhood ideology
1421268 its important to point out that music doesnt cause these behaviours its more a case of teenagers who may have a mental illness or are involved in these antisocial behaviours being drawn to certain types of music
1421269 fears of communism and greater teen independence in the 1950s anti war movements in the late 1960s and early 1970s concerns with lyrics and formation of the parents music resource center in the mid 1980s or the emergence of rap and hip hop music today
1421270 if you look carefully at those moments youll find that we are not dealing with the real issues
1421271 we are displacing a lot of nervousness insecurity or anxiety onto rock n roll it becomes a scapegoat for bigger issues and bigger problems
1421272 what else are you going to put in your 15 000 birkin bag not the latest free phone from verizon thats for sure
1421273 the restriction on reimbursement means every penny in health care is spent twice
1421274 even though the technology is there the hospitals cant afford to deploy the technology to save lives
1421275 its one person at a time its one incident at a time
1421276 i have no hard feelings and i mean that truly
1421277 all of those people should go on the no fly list
1421278 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1421279 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1421280 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1421281 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1421282 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1421283 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1421284 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1421285 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1421286 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1421287 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1421288 the memo stresses that dia shall not be designated as a law enforcement activity and shall not perform any law enforcement functions previously assigned to dod cifa
1421289 this seems like an attempt to differentiate and distance the new organization from the controversies that dogged the old one
1421290 the realignment of cifas functions and resources into dia strengthens the close historical and operational relationship between counterintelligence and humint
1421291 integration under one organization will result in greater collaboration in operational and support areas where both disciplines overlap
1421292 wont simply be defending against foreign spies i e defensive counterintelligence they will be actively attempting to infiltrate derail and defeat foreign intelligence operations
1421293 thats a tricky dangerous line of work but also potentially an enormously productive one
1421294 no secret deal or accommodation kept us out of the city
1421295 as 90 percent of the attacks were against us we thought if we moved out we would remove the source of the problem
1421296 but actually the jaish al mahdi the mahdi army had been fighting us because we were the only obstacle to their total control
1421297 there was no structure in place in the city for units to go back in and start mentoring the iraqi troops
1421298 when the action was launched british forces provided a raft of military support including armor artillery airpower medical and logistic support
1421299 what happened in basra nasiriyah amarah and other areas falls on the shoulders of the british forces
1421300 basra is considered the economic capital of iraq but the british let the militias do what they wanted
1421301 various landmarks in the united states including new york city
1421302 chemical substances in gel and liquid form that were sealed in bottles and glass jars
1421303 i believe shes become a terrible embarrassment to them but shes not a terrorist
1421304 when the truth comes out people will see she did nothing wrong
1421305 the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
1421306 you can make the argument that the inflation risks are a little less than in june and the growth outlook a little worse
1421307 we are starting to see signs that consumers are pulling back even faster than we expected
1421308 as a high luxury brand we are representing europe to the world
1421309 but we dont want the rules to disproportionately disadvantage small volume and niche manufacturers many of which are in the u k
1421310 we dont believe the intention is to make us extinct
1421311 we are committed to reduce co2 emissions heavily in the next years so we are doing whatever is possible without destroying the dna of the brand to bring them down to a much better level than today

1421318 the taliban are now mounting a hit and run war against their enemies
1421319 it doesnt need much money or weapons compared to what the foreign troops are spending
1421320 the goal of terrorism is to terrify and to intimidate
1421321 it is not to take and hold territory it is not to dominate institutions it is not to win the allegiance of the populace it is to terrify and the tactics of the taliban are more terroristic even than at the end of the last fighting season
1421322 the increasing use of very public attacks has had a striking effect on morale far beyond the immediate victims
1421323 now they are on the brink of humiliation thats the aim of our fight

1421328 since your historic victory in the primary there have been troubling signs that you are moving away from the core commitments shared by many who have supported your campaign toward a more cautious and centrist stance including most notably your vote for the fisa legislation granting telecom companies immunity from prosecution for illegal wiretapping which angered and dismayed so many of your supporters they list a few of the issues where the presumptive democratic nominee has changed his views since the primary campaign while the are essential to sustaining

1421351 when we analyzed the human trafficking cases we found that 64 are missing 17 are escapees on the way to enslavement 4 were sold as housemaids and to the entertainment industry and 37 were sold as wives to foreigner husbands
1421352 we can certainly say their law is ineffective to curb this problem because most of the victims are denied protection by the concerned authority when they arrive back on the border and urged the authorities to provide protection moreover they were expelled from their offices with abusive words
1421353 the number of victims is rising the human trafficking law will be meaningless under the ruling junta which is systematically violating human rights moreover the current policy of the government is forcing the people to migrate
1421354 we would like to urge the international community to study human trafficking cases they should not be misled by the bogus anti human trafficking campaign of the junta and in fact their campaign worsens the human right situation in burma and encourages more human right violations there must be a short term solution for this problem and also there must be political change in burma for a long term solution
1421355 china is uniquely positioned to address burmas problems and to facilitate democratic reform
1421356 this is why international demands for change must be matched with action including an arms embargo and targeted financial sanctions
1421357 un must give a time limit to the burmese government to implement political reforms otherwise there will be no changes
1421358 china must stop protecting burma at the un security council
1421359 their china and russia support is heightening the sufferings of the people of burma and is causing a threat not only to the security of the country but also to the region
1421360 chinas pledge to improve its own human rights record should extend to its foreign policy especially to burma where human rights abuses are rampant
1421361 with just a few days remaining before the olympics we hope that the chinese government realizes that another torch must be carried the torch of freedom and democracy for the people of burma
1421362 we had a long chat his health is good but he is a little thinner
1421363 we are glad to see him again after two months because some are only allowed to meet their families after three or four months he was calm and stable when he met his daughter who came along
1421364 we heard that there are at least six cases against them we will know the details after seven days
1421365 many of the victims are denied protection by the authority even when they seek after escaping and arriving back at the border officers often swear at them and turn them away
1421366 besides the juntas policies are the major driving force for the people to migrate
1421367 i n fact their campaign worsens human right situation in burma and encourages more human right violations there must be a short term solution for this problem and also there must be political change in burma for a long term solution

1421371 the more companies that support asacp and its child protection mission the more effective asacp can make its reporting hotline and its advocacy work in washington d c
1421372 we are proud to be associated with asacp and all the fine work they do in protecting the interests of children worldwide their hotline is a valuable online tool that has simplified the process of reporting offending content and websites giving us all a much safer internet we encourage everyone in the adult industry to join us in supporting asacp

1421383 considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes the rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused french politicians and military officials to justice

1421385 ive had a three week break and i feel fresh coming out im always happy to come back to malaysia as ive won the malaysian open twice previously in 2004 and 2005
1421386 my doctor has given me the go ahead to play but i need to continuously strengthen my back and go through stretching exercises to keep it in shape however i cannot do much gym work or running as before due to my back
1421387 however im hitting it nicely with some slight adjustments but i need to putt better which has held me back the first six months of the year was tough but thats in the past now i know i have to keep my body strong and start playing well again
1421388 my last win was the volvo masters of asia in 2006 so its been a while i also want a win to get into the hsbc champions later this year
1421389 itll be good to get the ball rolling again in the past three or four weeks ive put a lot of work into the game with a new coach ive been trying a few things to see if it works hopefully itll be a good second half for me
1421390 the course has never been this firm before and it makes the course narrower and shorter being on the fairway will be a premium this week
1421391 its always good to come back to a course where you know where the bounces are going to come from
1421392 its a big thing for the local players itll be good to play against better players on a very good golf course a lot of malaysian players are thankful for this most of them are nervous as theyve been playing against themselves for long but will now face international and better players this week
1421393 ive played only eight rounds of golf in the past six weeks
1421394 ive been doing a lot of house work and spending time with the kids but i have missed being competitive and playing against these guys
1421395 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1421396 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1421397 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate there are some things we need to go through
1421398 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1421399 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be
1421400 our research shows that the rough has become less of a challenge for the highly skilled professional and that driving accuracy is now less of a key factor for success
1421401 we believe that these changes will increase the challenge of the game at the tour level while having a very small effect on the play of most golfers
1421402 the pga tour supports the decision of the united states golf association and the r amp a regarding new groove specifications and we plan to implement the rule change as a condition of competition for our events across the three tours beginning january 1 2010
1421403 we do so with full confidence that the testing and analytical procedure was extensive and thorough including significant data provided by the tours shotlink scoring system and the support from our members for various types of field testing
1421404 the scientific research on the effect of grooves on spin and the ability of highly skilled professional golfers to control shots from the rough was very compelling
1421405 the usga and the r amp a took additional time to consider fully the potential ramifications for all levels of golfers
1421406 in particular we took care to minimize the impact on amateurs who actively compete in club and local competitions as well as other golfers who do not want to replace recently purchased clubs
1421407 ultimately we came to the conclusion that the path forward was to get the top level professional tours under the new groove regulations as soon as possible and to phase in the next level of amateur competition four years later in 2014
1421408 this means that clubs you own today will still be conforming for top level amateur competition for another 5 1 2 years and for other competitions conforming until at least 2024 if not indefinitely

1421417 the law punishes teenage boys who tie up and abuse a stray cat so why allow industrialists to run factory farms that keep pigs almost all their lives in tiny pens that are barely bigger than they are

1421420 now there may be good solutions in this world for example a sensible monaletheist could point out that superposition and conjunction are very different things that mathematically superposition is represented by linear combination and that this sort of linear combination might not in fact make true the conjunction of the a statement describing one of these states and its negation surely however the beginning of wisdom would be the recognition that a language without the expressive resources to discuss cats would simply be a bad medium in which to discuss this thorny problem

1421426 fallout from a weaker u s economy accelerated during june with consumer confidence dropping unemployment rates moving sharply higher and home prices declining at the fastest rate in decades
1421427 consumer spending slowed during the latter part of the quarter and credit indicators deteriorated beyond our expectations
1421428 in light of the weakening economy we are no longer tracking to our prior forecast of 4 6 percent earnings per share growth that outlook was based on business and economic conditions in line with or moderately worse than january 2008 the environment has weakened significantly since then particularly during the month of june

1421455 the aba submits that such an appearance of impropriety may be created where as in the present case a judicial officer denies a recusal motion and continues to sit on a case where one of the parties has made significant contributions to the judges election campaign
1421456 it has long been recognized that there is a presumption of honesty and integrity in those serving as adjudicators
1421457 due process therefore requires recusal only in those rare cases wherein a judge or justice has a direct personal substantial or pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case
1421458 benjamin created an appearance of bias that would diminish the integrity of the judicial process in the eyes of any reasonable person
1421459 we are obviously pleased that so many distinguished institutions have chosen to speak out about the undue influence of money upon the elected judiciary
1421460 a line needs to be drawn somewhere to prevent a judge from hearing cases involving a person who has made massive campaign contributions to benefit the judge

1421523 a new book by the author ron suskind claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein
1421524 the letters existence has been reported before and it had been written about as if it were genuine it was passed in baghdad to a reporter for the london sunday telegraph who wrote about it on the front page of dec 14 2003 under the headline
1421525 the telegraph story by con coughlin which coincidentally ran the day hussein was captured in his spider hole was touted in the u s media by supporters of the war and he was interviewed on nbcs
1421526 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 suskind writes
1421527 suskind writes in his new book that the order to create the letter was written on creamy white house stationery the book suggests that the letter was subsequently created by the cia and delivered to iraq but does not say how
1421528 the author claims that such an operation part of false pretenses for war would apparently constitute illegal white house use of the cia to influence a domestic audience an arguably impeachable offense
1421529 t he heart of the controversy is whether senior presidential aides are absolutely immune from compelled congressional process
1421530 the supreme court has reserved absolute immunity for very narrow circumstances involving the presidents personal exposure to suits for money damages based on his official conduct or concerning matters of national security or foreign affairs the executives current claim of absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without any support in the case law
1421531 it is important to note that the decision today is very limited to be sure most of this lengthy opinion addresses and ultimately rejects the executives several reasons why the court should not entertain the committees lawsuit but on the merits of the committees present claims the court only resolves and again rejects the claim by the executive to absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides the specific claims of executive privilege that ms miers and mr bolten may assert are not addressed and the court expresses no view on such claims nor should this decision discourage the process of negotiation and accommodation that most often leads to resolution of disputes between the political branches
1421532 t his inquiry does not involve the sensitive topics of national security or foreign affairs congress moreover is acting pursuant to a legitimate use of its investigative authority notwithstanding its best efforts the committee has been unable to discover the underlying causes of the forced terminations of the u s attorneys the committee has legitimate reasons to believe that ms mierss testimony can remedy that deficiency there is no evidence that the committee is merely seeking to harass ms miers by calling her to testify importantly moreover ms miers remains able to assert privilege in response to any specific question or subject matter
1421533 the executive presents a litany of reasons why the court should decline to decide this case but the crux of the executives position is that the federal judiciary should not enter into this dispute between the political branches
1421534 there is some force to the executives position but the court is not persuaded to begin with whatever way this court decides the issues before it may impact the balance between the political branches in this and future settings as the court has already noted quoting himself in oral arguments this is one of the difficulties i have because both sides have that same point whatever i do whether i rule for the executive branch or rule for the legislative branch that somehow i am going to disrupt the balance that has existed hence a decision to foreclose access to the courts as the executive urges would tilt the balance in favor of the executive here the very mischief the executive purports to fear moreover the executive is mistaken in the contention that judicial intervention in this arena at the request of congress would be unprecedented in the nations history the 1974 decision by the supreme court in united states v nixon adjusted this balance by clarifying that the judiciary must be available to resolve executive privilege claims
1421535 was light on new details but heavy on rhetorical disputes with members of a house judiciary subcommittee
1421536 addington who has been widely described as one of the key forces behind the bush administrations most aggressive counterterrorism policies said some reports of his involvement were overstated
1421537 addington also said he was more deeply involved in the cias interrogation program than the one used by the pentagon at the military detention facility in guantanamo bay cuba
1421538 much of the hearing was consumed by semantic or legalistic disputes and the only two republicans who attended complained that the democrats were hectoring the witnesses yoo frequently said he could not discuss internal deliberations citing instructions from the justice department
1421539 there he sat hunched and scowling at the witness table in front of the house judiciary committee the bearded burly form of the chief of staff and alter ego to the vice president cheneys cheney if you will and the man most responsible for building president bushs notion of an imperial presidency
1421540 could the president ever be justified in breaking the law
1421541 think of addington as the id of the bush white house though his hidden hand is often merely suspected in signing statements torture policy and other brazen assertions of executive power addingtons unbridled hostility was live and unfiltered yesterday
1421542 the presidents comments on iran essentially restated administration policy but they came as the region has seen a confusing succession of warnings threats and just this week signs of a suddenly more conciliatory tone emanating from some iranian officials
1421543 then on wednesday the commander of united states naval forces in the persian gulf said the united states navy and its regional allies would stop any such iranian action
1421544 asked about a flurry of reports suggesting the u s or israel may attack iran by the end of the year the president did little to discourage the talk
1421545 the doldrums of the fourth of july recess have been enlivened by fresh talk of another war is it a diplomatic bluff or a serious possibility
1421546 the administration for its part seems eager to convince iran that president bush is crazy enough to sanction an attack
1421547 abcs martha raddatz invited bush to strongly discourage israel from such an activity the president declined i have made it very clear to all parties that the first option ought to be to solve this problem diplomatically he said
1421548 an insular and secretive white house that he said lied about the leaking of a cia officers name and overstated intelligence in the rush to war in iraq
1421549 said bush squandered the publics trust by not following through on promises to fire those involved in disclosing the identity of cia officer valerie plame wilson and to publicly divulge details about the case
1421550 the continuing cloud of suspicion over the white house is not something i can remove because i know only one part of the story mcclellan said during several hours of testimony before the house judiciary committee
1421551 former bush press secretary scott mcclellan told congress under oath friday what he never said from the white house lectern that top officials misled the country about iraq and are still concealing the truth about leaking a cia operatives name
1421552 the vice president has information that has not been shared publicly mr
1421553 at long last the most significant issues in the case of one time cia officer valerie plame wilson are emerging under congressional scrutiny
1421554 five years into the plame scandal that remains the most salient question not only for cheney but for bush too what did they tell special counsel patrick j fitzgerald when he and his investigators interviewed them about the leak of plames identity and the attempted coverup
1421555 most americans have long since discarded any illusions about the integrity of this administration especially in matters surrounding the war in iraq
1421556 i am concerned about the subpoenas impact on white house cooperation with future justice department criminal investigations
1421557 there is a cloud over the vice president and that cloud remains because this defendant obstructed justice
1421558 i hope you will not accede to the white house objections
1421559 during the clinton administration your predecessor janet reno made an independent judgment and provided numerous fbi interview reports to the committee including reports of interviews with president clinton vice president gore and three white house chiefs of staff i have been informed that attorney general reno neither sought nor obtained white house consent before providing these interview records to the committee i believe the justice department should exercise the same independence in this case

1421576 senator obamas stance on offshore oil drilling has been mischaracterized he has not changed his position he has continually campaigned against additional drilling calling the policy a gimmick saying it was a scheme and ridiculing those who support it with his steadfast opposition to john mccains all of the above approach to our energy crisis americans should know that barack obama remains opposed to additional domestic oil drilling speaker pelosi moveon org and the sierra club can take comfort from the fact that barack obama still opposes additional domestic oil drilling meanwhile the american people can be sure that john mccain will do what is necessary to reduce this countrys dependence on middle east oil and bring down prices at the pump

1421607 i didnt really no what to expect i had a lot of pressure on me i was just trying to figure everything out

1421633 since friday the republicans in congress have been playing to the television cameras with theatrical stunts because speaker pelosi blocked their offshore drilling plan the republican plan will not lower gas prices but it will line the pockets of big oil executives the same people donating millions of dollars to republicans

1421635 get things done instead of doing things he would rather do
1421636 this is a major message to america and america is listening
1421637 i dont think it is hard to imagine that the past four weeks which generally have not been great for obama would have been very different if well funded 527s like vote vets and progressive media usa were flooding the airwaves and appearing on news programs with attacks on mccain as it is obamas relative reluctance to go on the attack combined with severely weakened progressive advocacy organizations is the main reason why mccain has been able to dominate the terms of the debate lately
1421638 obamas numbers havent dropped and are actually on a slight uptick instead mccains have risen quite dramatically gaining 3 2 in just one week his new identity based lines of attack appear to be consolidating some undecided in his favor rather than peeling off obama supporters it isnt about gas prices or drilling coverage of that issue has been dwarfed by the identity based attacks
1421639 ive had a bad feeling about the direction of the campaign for the past couple weeks weve been saying for months that mccain and the gop would go negative very negative no surprise that is whats happening
1421640 the negative attacks have already started and they seem to have eroded obamas lead in the national polls fortunately the state by state polls still look excellent but there is cause for concern
1421641 i dont think it is hard to imagine that the past four weeks which generally have not been great for obama would have been very different if well funded 527s like vote vets and progressive media usa were flooding the airwaves and appearing on news programs with attacks on mccain as it is obamas relative reluctance to go on the attack combined with severely weakened progressive advocacy organizations is the main reason why mccain has been able to dominate the terms of the debate lately of course we are losing debates we through away our best weapons if obama loses this campaign it will be just as much his fault for de funding the 527s as it will be for the media buying into mccains attacks in fact the entire reason you fund the former is because by now all democrats should expect the latter
1421642 obama is out organizing mccain dramatically in field both in terms of small dollar donations and in terms of putting real resources into states
1421643 obama seems pretty much on his own in facing down mccains increasingly nasty attacks yes we have the blogs but the blogs arent enough by themselves see my discussion of this further down the conventional wisdom is that the best way to respond to these kind of attacks is to respond in kind and blow them out of the water note how mccain responded to obamas race comment and note how it threw the obama people off balance also note what mccain did to wesley clark you do that with the candidate himself sometimes if you feel a need to show that the candidate can get angry if necessary i e has balls but more often you use outside groups and surrogate members of congress and other third parties like the blogs talk radio etc but in this case our outside groups were shut down a few months ago so theyre gone and many of their staff some of the top political people in town arent even working on the election at all now as for democratic senators and house members theyve been oddly silent over the past week or two and at least dont seem part of any larger public and coordinated strategy to counterattack and yes finally the blogs are still here but as ive argued many a time see the samuel alito filubuster fiasco the blogs cant act in a vacuum a proper political marketing strategy requires multiple layers multiple actors each complementing the others work the others message the others attacks
1421644 given the adulatory media coverage to date this suggests significant weakness on obamas part
1421645 these trends look very troubling not just for obama but for the entire democratic party it looks like both have run out of gas in this electoral cycle and that may not just be a metaphor if the democrats and obama offer nothing but populist platitudes and obstructionism on developing american oil production and american jobs this summer swoon may only get worse in november
1421646 no one from the mccain campaign is going to start measuring drapes they are well aware of the fact that the conditions favor a democratic victory but barack obamas inability to make the sale complete is rapidly becoming an unshakably bad trait
1421647 how did this possibly happen ive got a few theories im of the opinion that the more people learn about barack obama the worse it is for him obama is charismatic and highly likable so his first impression is very positive but the more people learn about his positions and background the harder it will be for him to be all things to all people in short his support is tenuous and superficial mccain won the week last week because for the first time this cycle the mccain campaign had a consistent message and was able to begin crafting a negative narrative to define obama as out of touch mccain strategist steve schmidt has been at the helm for less than a month but he was able to turn obamas trip into a positive for mccain or at least make it a wash not bad at all it is also likely that there has been a backlash to obamas trip aside from the fact that speaking to 200 000 berliners isnt necessarily going to play well in peoria failing to visit the wounded troops plays into the stereotype about democrats not caring for the troops
1421648 its interesting that obama has responded to the political circumstances of the day by giving this major address he rightly lamented that it took 30 years of government inaction to get to this crisis point and mentioned that john mccain had been part of the government for 26 of those years touche still he avoids mentioning the areas where government has done the most harm namely its jihad against nuclear power and its various prohibitions on fully exploiting our indigenous resources why does he avoid mentioning such things because those are policies hell perpetuate whats more obama has been a senator for almost four years and running for president for almost two years i dont recall energy being a preoccupation of either senator obama or candidate obama until this past week
1421649 yesterdays energy speech by obama was a perfect example of the almost astonishing emptiness of the obama platform on this and other crucial issues obama declared that as president he would direct 15 billion a year into an effort that would end our import of oil from the middle east and venezuela while creating 5 million new jobs over 10 years no specifics were provided details to follow i guess this is the sort of stuff that high school debaters wouldnt dare try as even a sleepy judge would flunk them for offering up magic machines that work on sugar as the answer to our energy problems obama dares not offer any specifics on any element of his plan because none are possible or even capable of passing the laugh test
1421650 this is of course another policy reversal on obamas part until now he has opposed selling gasoline from the reserve now i have no problem with a politician changing his mind when conditions change but obamas opposition to selling petroleum from the reserve is not some relic of the days of cheap oil it was reiterated on july 7 in st louis on july 7 oil and gas prices were higher than they are today not lower so obamas explanation that he changed his mind because americans are suffering is transparently false what has really happened is that obama has been reading the polls as always john mccain has caught up with him and poll respondents now say that they trust mccain more on energy hence the new policies that obama unveiled today
1421651 a month ago barack obama righteously not to mention correctly opposed tapping the strategic oil reserve back then obama said that we should only tap the reserve in the event of an emergency since then oil prices have plummeted by 25 barrel or more than 16 and yet now inexplicably the emergency according to obama has grown since his last pronouncement on the subject and we must now tap the strategic reserves
1421652 obamas plan to release 70 million barrels from the reserve is as insulting as it is cynical according to the energy information agency the united states uses about 20 million barrels of oil a day obama called for 70 million barrels of oil to be released from the spr to help lower prices furthermore he dressed up his proposal by specifically calling for light crude to be released on the theory that it could be more easily refined into gasoline and thus have the greatest impact on prices 70 million divided by 20 million is 3 5 so obamas answer to high gasoline prices is to release three and a half days worth of oil from the nations emergency reserves
1421653 thats not change america needs thats a legacy senator going along with the washington thinking and failed establishment policies the democratic party selected barack obama as our nominee for the express purpose of moving our party and our country away from these failed policies dont choose a fellow whose career is defined by these policies senator obama its the most important decision you will make before your inauguration and you can do better sir as you must
1421654 on paper bayh seems like a good veep candidate but ugh
1421655 the selection of bayh would be met by stony silence at best within the progressive movement many would be outraged and consider it a betrayal of trust for my part id be bitterly disappointed but i wouldnt read it as anything more or less than a strategic calculation
1421656 i cant say that id be thrilled with the selection of evan bayh as barack obamas vp nominee but this has more to do with personality factors my feeling that bayh is a little dull and drab and that obama may underestimate the importance of maintaining high levels of excitement among the democratic base than anything having to do with his voting record bayh gets a bad rap in the liberal blogopshere because he is perceived as a centrist there is a grain of truth in that he certainly isnt vt sen bernie sanders but he also isnt from vermont hes from indiana and i would argue that bayh is about as liberal a senator as indiana is likely to elect
1421657 my hunch now is that itll be evan bayh if for no other reason than evan bayh is the single whitest man in america and i have a feeling that the obama campaign wants americas whitest man in some pictures these days ks gov kathleen sebelius was always something of a gamble a doubling down on the sort of politics that obama was pursuing but as the obama campaign has lost its message a bit and watched the new politics get kicked in the teeth a couple times by the old politics its becoming less likely that theyll make a particularly innovative veep choice bayh is conservative hawkish and elevating him to veep will deprive obama of a crucial vote in the senate but hes a known quantity in the midwest and and for the media and the obama campaign is being reminded of the need for a known quantity every time they turn on the television
1421658 ten senior hess corporation executives and or members of the hess family each gave 28 500 to the joint rnc mccain fundraising committee just days after mccain reversed himself to favor offshore drilling according to federal election commission reports these hess contributions will give more ammo to those arguing that mccain is being rewarded by campaign contributions in exchange for pro industry positions
1421659 a hess office manager and her husband an amtrak worker both
1421660 sargent actually got on the phone and talked to the office manager about the contributions and she adamantly claims the contributed funds are entirely their own
1421661 thats mavericky that my friends is ethical politicking we the carpetbagger reports
1421662 this isnt an instance in which big oil was just supporting the republican candidate because of partisan and or ideological loyalties this is big oil rewarding john mccain for reversing course and telling voters exactly what the industry wants the public to hear
1421663 theres not any disguising the fact that mccain benefited tremendously from reversing his position on the federal offshore drilling ban a strategy that is purely political and yields almost no practical improvement for our current energy situation
1421664 its entirely possible these contributions are legitimate and that hess staffers just love mccain ever since he flipped on drilling thats the charitable explanation the bad one is illegal straw contributions from oil companies its well established that the mccain campaign is crawling with lobbyists and deeply corrupted by their influence with the new set of positions matching the concerns of the new corporate contributors this set of oil company donations is the most vibrant example and so it makes the most sense to continue on the offense and keep pointing them out
1421665 does anyone understand why obama suggesting that people keep their tires properly inflated is some sort of hilarious gaffe
1421666 the list is a little long to reproduce here but sure enough ct sen joe lieberman crist schwarzenegger the bush administration republican congressional candidates nascar and the american petroleum institute all agree that routine tire maintenance actually help fuel efficiency just as obama said public opinion is notoriously hard to predict but i feel pretty certain this is a loser of a stunt no one no matter how ignorant can really believe that properly inflated tires are the sum total of obamas energy policy
1421667 no one doubts that proper tire inflation can help with efficiency and no one thinks its silly to maintain ones vehicle for a variety of reasons however obama clearly stated that we could get just as much oil from tire inflation and tune ups as we can get from drilling a ludicrous statement well deserving of ridicule
1421668 in other news liberal bloggers are buzzing about ex mccain strategist criticism of the mccain camps recent tactics which they see as evidence that the mccain camps negativity is causing a backlash conservative bloggers meanwhile are linking to column that mocks obama for being presumptuous the excitement that weavers and milbanks respective words are generating in the blogosphere illustrates how people in politics are never more influential than when theyre criticizing their own side
1421669 yes because dana milbanks a liberal just like john weaver is a conservative please kill me
1421670 even keith olbermann s regulars think its time for a hubris check
1421671 even the likes of dana milbank are beginning to get tired of the arrogance that now emanates from the obama campaign

1421673 dana milbank the snark master at the washington post included a grossly out of context quote from barack obama in milbank mocked those who challenged him to most of the traditional media and almost every cable pundit thats quite acceptable not to keith olbermann its practically a first a reporter is suffering the consequences for bad behavior keith says good luck but this feels more like good riddance

1421733 la conclusi n es que todo marcha bien la valoraci n de los ciudadanos y los medios de comunicaci n es muy positiva

1421759 i have been playing world of war craft for one year and a half playing games has become my strong desire that pushes me in front of the computer screen every time i am free
1421760 can be seen at every single corner of shanghai or beijing and the fact that china becomes one of the biggest online game markets is totally understandable
1421761 it was so funny that the first time when i started to play online game i looked around in the internet shop and imitated a small boy sitting next to me to take a microphone and talk to my partners all are men
1421762 it was because im female i was a bit angry with those guys and immediately search a voice changer online luckily i found one my god my voice totally became male voice and i was able to play world of warcraft with those guys until i came to level 35 then i decided to talk to them that i was a girl wow they were shocked and we are close friends in the group now

1421774 the serac broke loose and it would have been sudden they would not have seen it coming
1421775 the verdict that matters most has already been delivered this trial was a betrayal of american values and will rightly be seen as illegitimate by the rest of the world
1421776 personally im always ready to learn although i dont always like being taught
1421777 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1421778 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1421779 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves

1421782 busy summer of blocking takeovers handing out government subsidies and threatening giant corporations with regulation if they dont mend their ways
1421783 it is good to know that a canadian is exposing the bush administrations behaviour especially at a time when prime minister stephen harper finds very little wrong with it

1421787 one hears of soldiers being told to shoot only at people who are armed
1421788 for an officer whose men were jailed his regiment disbanded and he himself found to be a failed commander by a public inquiry
1421789 and neither john mccain nor barack obama wants that issue to come to the forefront because it divides their base
1421790 retreat toward the great power world before 1914 and a world divided between alliances of democratic and autocratic states
1421791 leadership from an american president to whom it cannot condescend
1421792 a grand alliance led by the united states france germany japan the uk and india should always be able to outbid china or russia for any countrys goodwill including each others

1421807 ya ha cumplido la condena que le fue impuesta por los delitos que ha cometido
1421808 ya ha cumplido la condena que le fue impuesta por los delitos que ha cometido
1421809 todav a hemos visto estos d as al anterior ministro de justicia hablando de construir nuevas imputaciones para que de juana siguiera en la c rcel pero eso es hacer un flaco favor a la democracia y al estado de derecho
1421810 la democracia y el estado de derecho como m s se fortalecen es con la aplicaci n escrupulosa y rigurosa de la ley y de la normativa vigente en cada momento
1421811 si de juana sigue siendo un terrorista no arrepentido su lugar natural sigue siendo la c rcel
1421812 estamos haciendo m s publicidad y la publicidad fortalece a los movimientos terroristas
1421813 s lo pueden implantar el terror si se habla de ellos
1421814 el error que comete el estado de derecho con la reducci n de la condena y la excarcelaci n es que de juana est consiguiendo una segunda rentabilidad por sus m s de 20 asesinatos

1421831 i also have to do it for boxing canada this is make or break if i do well in this tournament it can do well for our future fighters in this country
1421832 i dont want to call it a monkey on the back
1421833 i dont think we came back with the thought of fixing something so much has changed
1421834 the further you get from the athens regatta the less important it becomes i think that has evolved in the last three or four weeks the closer we get to the first race the less important is the last four years
1421835 i cant worry so much about the medal we are going to win
1421836 i think we have to win by the fact the team is a great team as a unit
1421837 if you are not prepared for the olympics its quite overwhelming
1421838 ive already walked through this pass before and i feel much more prepared
1421839 if they are seeing canadian fighters for the first time they dont know us from adam
1421840 its important you come familiar with the different countries and different system with fighters in those countries
1421841 we noticed when they were out there but we noticed when everyone was out there
1421842 there is that feeling we owe them one when you are out on the course you try to be as sharp as you can
1421843 this will put them on the same playing field as resorts hotels and motels
1421844 historically with zoning in stearns county vacation rentals was not allowed but why couldnt we make provisions for that kind of use provided the property met performance standards of public safety and public health
1421845 we will try to get a backup aircraft and get them on their way
1421846 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
1421847 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1421848 if i am an angel paint me with black wings
1421849 well shes an amazing girl and anybody would be lucky to be dating her
1421850 well like i said anybody would be lucky to be dating her
1421851 i think she is a part of our music video and that is why all the rumors started but yeah shes a cool girl
1421852 i think anyone would like to go on a date with her
1421853 i think the audience will really enjoy him letting loose like that
1421854 borat cultural learnings of america for make benefit glorious nation of kazakhstan
1421855 if you look at most of these r rated movies that found an audience its because they were really good
1421856 the r rating allows the filmmakers to truly realize their vision theres just a freedom that comes with it theres no way wedding crashers could have been wedding crashers if you inhibit what it was that owen wilson and vince vaughn were able to do in that movie
1421857 we were like gosh everyones getting to have their cake and eat it too with 40 year old virgin and wedding crashers
1421858 just this little opening seemed to happen with the way the studios were willing to go ok r rated movies seem to be profitable so well maybe open that door a little bit
1421859 you luckily have some hit movies and then you kind of go ok you want us to do another one
1421860 there was no talk of toning it down there was no intention of making a conventional movie in an attempt to reach a mass audience
1421861 we wouldnt have wanted to do something that didnt reflect the show and didnt respect the audiences investment in the show and what made it different and unique
1421862 anythings possible and so more than wanting to make it an r rated movie we just wanted the freedom to make it whatever its going to be
1421863 also comedys job is to push boundaries we didnt make the boundaries we didnt move the last boundary but here we are people are expecting something a little crazier than the last thing they saw
1421864 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1421865 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1421866 the wording is a little strong over inflation but theres really no real change in policy
1421867 i think they are trying to buy time to allow the economy to recover and so that the financials can slowly repair
1421868 we believe this rule change is necessary to reinforce the importance of accuracy at the highest levels of the game
1421869 in the next week or so i will have to make one of the biggest decisions of my career
1421870 i am nearing the crossroads where if the injury does not improve i will have to decide whether or not to go ahead with surgery
1421871 the alternative is simply to give my wrist more time to heal and continue with the rehabilitation therapy which i have been doing over the past few weeks
1421872 it is a huge decision because if i go for surgery next week then i certainly would be out for at least two to three months which would take me through to october in effect i would miss the rest of the season
1421873 driving in here it was nice to see where everything was and bring back a few memories
1421874 ive been out on the golf course and although it has changed a little bit basically its the same im looking forward to the week
1421875 i played pretty good that week in 2004 and obviously im playing all right at the moment i hope to carry that form through
1421876 dass es dort auch nach den olympischen spielen solche anschl ge geben wird weil die ursache nicht beseitigt ist durch die spiele im gegenteil es wird auch danach probleme geben weil die soziale ungerechtigkeit in china sich vergr ert und die beziehungen zwischen der zentralregierung und den minderheiten versch rfen sich
1421877 kann sie einsetzen um proteste von demonstranten die sich f r mehr demokratie einsetzen im keim zu ersticken

1421880 die hilfe f r afrika ist in dieser form nicht gut
1421881 im not as stressed i obviously know im good enough to win
1421882 but this one at birkdale was a lot more satisfying
1421883 a leading source of radical homosexual propaganda anti christian bigotry and radical transgender advocacy
1421884 i have been mocked over and over again by ungodly and unprincipled anti christian lesbians
1421885 six years in sodom from the journal of james hartline
1421886 my client killed the victim because the victim teased my client for being homosexual
1421887 the fact that sheen and petersen both happen to be on cbs is coincidental
1421888 theyre at the very top of their game and are the best at what they do youd expect them to be at the top of the scale
1421889 that last bit was way out of line a few taunts is one thing but nobody deserves physical violence simply because they support the opposing team i dont care how intense the rivalry is fans of all types should feel safe at whatever ballpark they choose to attend
1421890 wow thanks for the freepass to beat yankee fans at fenway park
1421891 how the sox fan acts usually dictates how they are treated
1421892 i usually respect mr abrahams opinion but give me a break its just a game and no one ever deserves physical abuse for rooting for their team you and an awful lot of your readers are being big overly macho babies
1421893 wow thanks for the freepass to beat yankee fans at fenway park
1421894 i usually respect mr abrahams opinion but give me a break its just a game and no one ever deserves physical abuse for rooting for their team you and an awful lot of your readers are being big overly macho babies
1421895 i was at a yanks sox game in fenway a couple eyars ago 04 to be exact and to be more exact the arod tek bench clearing brawl fight game
1421896 but im not gunna go sue the eagles enter at your own risk
1421897 be careful about getting too excited about hearing a certain player is on waivers teams routinely try and get one player through by putting the entire roster on waivers over a period of days
1421898 derek jeter mariano rivera andy pettitte and carl pavano have been placed on waivers
1421899 no to washburn let the kids finish out the season
1421900 isnt there some kind of order in which the teams are ranked so if two or more teams claim a player the higher ranked team gets him
1421901 im optimistic with the way they stretched and pushed and pulled and did whatever they do as trainers

1422140 the fact is that history is made by men who comfort the problems of social progress and try to solve them in accordance with the historic conditions of their epoch they set their tasks in conformity with the given conditions of their times the closer the correspondence between a mans perception of reality and reality itself the greater the man the deeper his commitment to the peoples cause in his own time is evidenced by his life and deeds the more heroic he becomes as a leader of men

1422163 mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1422164 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1422165 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1422166 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1422167 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1422168 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1422169 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1422170 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1422171 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

1422173 draws a very distinct line between legitimate media and the bloggers that are left wing hatemongers the blogging done by legitimate media sources are not in the same category as the left wing hatemongers
1422174 the problem with such simple dichotomies when you talk about political communications these days is that its not an either or not jut this or that but a whole range a spectrum even among the liberal or conservative blogs those explicitly so youll find a wide range of efforts some focused to a degree on news and breaking information others focusing on putting ideas and opinion into the mix and others heading into altogether different directions

1422224 weve made major steps here i have to make sure that as minister i can get this through the legislative assembly
1422225 if we get this through then well have a look at it they can call it whatever they want to call it but it is a better step than what we had

1422228 from early during his stay in the far east he was likely a spy for the british government working with mi6 british foreign intelligence
1422229 required reading perhaps for anyone who considers journalism a calling
1422230 for reasons completely unconnected with espionage i cannot resist quoting the nine precepts which ozaki a far better journalist than sorge was or thought he was laid down as a guide for intelligence agents 1 never give the impression that you are eager to obtain news men who are engaged in important affairs will refuse to talk to you if they suspect that your motive is to collect information 2 if you give the impression that you have more information that your prospective informant he will give with a smile 3 informal dinner parties are an excellent setting for the gathering of news 4 it is convenient to be a specialist of some kind for my part i am a specialist on chinese questions and have always received inquiries from all quarters i was able to gather much data from men who came to ask me questions 5 my position as a writer for newspapers and magazines stood me in good stead 6 because i was often asked to lecture in all parts of japan i had an excellent chance to learn general trends of local opinion 7 connections with important organizations engaged in the collection of news are vital i was affiliated with the asahi shimbun and later with the south manchurian railway 8 above all you must cultivate trust and confidence in you on the part of those who you are using as informants in order to be able to pump them without seeming unnatural 9 in these days of unrest you cannot be a good intelligence man unless you yourself are a good source of information the reason i list the ozaki precepts with respectful salute to one communist at least who was an idealist as well as a realist is because they constitute a perfect guide to all young foreign correspondents every successful foreign newsman i ever knew followed and follows consciously or instinctively those same rules especially precepts 1 2 and 9
1422231 we had a mixed membership of war weary correspondents the worlds best reporters and combat photographers liberal conservative and radical commentators and some of the worlds most plausible rougues and magisterial scoundrels there were american and british and french and russian and chinese and australian and new zealand newspapermen cameramen and radio broadcasters
1422232 here lies the fool that tried to hurry the east they say of our copy but in fact we manage to tell a remarkable amount of truth considering that we are painfully torn between two qualities of time the pricelss stuff jealously hoarded by our editors in the impatient west and the cheap throwaway variety of the bureaucrats in the enternal east
1422233 when i was in school back in 1934 our teacher picked up an unruly student with one hand and whomped the stuffin outta him and we bee haved after that
1422234 mrs mays stopped teaching and came down the aisle toward us she grabbed fred by the back of his shirt and held him out at arms length with his feet dangling just above the floor with her right hand she hit him on the fat part of his buttocks and then jammed him down into his desk and went back to her desk and started teaching again
1422235 fear is the beginning of wisdom if teaching by intimidation didnt work no one would do it
1422236 it was so much easier and more fun to teach in the 80s when kids did their work behaved in class and never talked back to the teacher
1422237 the turnkey money machine that prints non stop profits for you automatically
1422238 this moderate measure merely seeks to provide certain farm animals with enough room to stand up lie down turn around and extend their limbs it really is that basic
1422239 requires that certain farm animals be allowed for the majority of every day to fully extend their limbs or wings lie down stand up and turn around limited exceptions apply
1422240 the law punishes teenage boys who tie up and abuse a stray cat so why allow industrialists to run factory farms that keep pigs almost all their lives in tiny pens that are barely bigger than they are
1422241 kept for most of their lives in pens too small to barely turn around in
1422242 u s society is extremely naive about the nature of agricultural production
1422243 i f the public knew more about the way in which agricultural and animal production infringes on animal welfare the outcry would be louder
1422244 in response to pigs being prone to fight when i visited pigs at sanctuaries they seem very peaceful and friendly maybe the crowded conditions and poor treatment make them more aggressive
1422245 this applies across the board animal rights types can be guilty of presenting farm animals as if they were pets but defenders of the yeoman farmer tend to gloss over the way those practices have been supplanted with protein production lines in which farm animals are treated as if they were inanimate components

1422254 taken off juvenile probation on june 2nd for drug charges
1422255 she was under the influence of alcohol or narcotics during the time that her baby was left unattended and eaten alive
1422256 police allege that linzy earles has a history of drug abuse
1422257 police have been called to their home three times previously since may 2007 in may and june last year police were dispatched there to investigate reports about a runaway
1422258 this material was never shown to kate gerry jane tanner or anyone else in the group
1422259 seeing it in the files is the first they have known about it again one has to ask what the police were doing by not making this material available at the time
1422260 it is frankly outrageous that information relating to potential suspects was not made available as a matter of extreme urgency once it was clear what had happened
1422261 the early stages of this were crucial and the police of all people should know that seeing these images has come as a shock to everyone concerned
1422262 the investigators are well aware that their work is not exempt from imperfections
1422263 they worked with an enormous margin of error and they achieved very little in terms of conclusive results
1422264 this is not unfortunately a police story a crime fit for the investigative mind of a sherlock holmes or a hercule poirot guided by the illusion that the forces of law and justice always restore order
1422265 he then realised the man was staring fixedly at the area in question very focused on what he was doing and did not notice flacks presence
1422266 he said he did not remember seeing the man there before or anywhere else in luz since madeleines disappearance
1422267 no element of proof whatsoever was found which allows us to form any lucid sensible serious and honest conclusion about the circumstances of madeleines disappearance
1422268 while it is a fact that madeleine disappeared from the ocean club apartment the circumstances and manner of how this happened is not known
1422269 i know the hideout name address everything of sic the kidnappers

1422271 out in middle america people who are in the middle of the country who dont understand where this guy is coming from are going to begin to see him as a hypocrite
1422272 and it would be very important for senator john mccain if hes going to point out flaws to pick up on things like this and do maybe a collage or a montage of all these kinds of moments
1422273 obama has no discernment to allow a 3 year old to listen to filthy rap does he even have a clue that borders on child neglect or something doesnt it he is as far away as middle america as he can be he doesnt like it when people call him scary but the thought of him in the white house is scary

1422276 be up to the state to draw any potential conclusions
1422277 the government has a strong wish to carry out the expulsion as quickly as possible but this will have to happen within the boundaries of norways international human rights obligations
1422278 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort

1422280 displayed extraordinary effort and showed a firm commitment to lead the team which will be responsible for attacking the targets that we have agreed to destroy
1422281 the idea was to take the letter to habbush and have him transcribe it in his own neat handwriting on a piece of iraqi government stationery to make it look legitimate
1422282 cia would then take the finished product to baghdad and have someone release it to the media
1422283 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence
1422284 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1422285 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1422286 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1422287 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate there are some things we need to go through
1422288 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1422289 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be
1422290 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1422291 we have not yet read the report which has not been sent to us by the rwandan government we are therefore not in a position to react
1422292 the overwhelming nature of frances support to the rwandan policy of massacres shows the complicity of french political and military officials in the preparation and execution of the genocide
1422293 did not challenge the infrastructure of genocide notably the checkpoints manned by the interahamwes
1422294 they clearly requested that the interahamwes continue to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee
1422295 considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes the rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused french politicians and military officials to justice

1422299 i will institute an independent defense priorities board to ensure that the quadrennial review is not used to justify unnecessary defense spending
1422300 third i will set a goal for a world without nuclear weapons to seek that goal i will not develop nuclear weapons i will seek a global ban on the production of fissile material and i will negotiate with russia to take our icbms off hair trigger alert and to achieve deep cuts in our nuclear arsenal

1422304 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1422305 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1422306 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1422307 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1422308 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 iraq was subject to
1422309 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1422310 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1422311 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1422312 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1422313 our biggest problem was people showing up to look for their bricks

1422315 dear friend homosexuals are on the march in this country
1422316 this is a last gasp of a party without ideas hamstrung by a politically weakened president and fully understanding that they are going to lose a significant number of seats in november
1422317 we dont want the government shutdown to be an issue but the fact is the democrats are so overconfident that theyre willing talk about extending the ban and theyre willing to talk about raising taxes on gasoline
1422318 i really sense that we are at a tipping point in our country on this issue
1422319 you sense the change that is happening in the debate
1422320 a smattering of house republicans are engaging in stunts on the house floor in a transparent political effort to manufacture headlines
1422321 meanwhile most of their republican colleagues returned home burdened with trying to explain why they blocked efforts to combat high gas prices
1422322 for six years republicans controlled every branch of government and did nothing while america became more dependent on foreign sources of oil
1422323 house republicans now want to dust off old proposals rejected by congress on a bipartisan basis as bad ideas and claim they have put forward solutions
1422324 for six years republicans controlled every branch of government and did nothing while america became more dependent on foreign sources of oil
1422325 the local foreign affairs department made an apology tuesday to two japanese reporters
1422326 we strongly protest against the violent detention of a reporter who was reporting by fair means
1422327 i dont speak chinese so i couldnt understand what they were doing or saying they just made me sit there i could not make a phone call it was unbelievable
1422328 we heard that the chinese side pointed out that it is forbidden to film military facilities and it seems like there was confusion because the scene of the assault was just 50 metres yards from a military facility
1422329 the fccc condemns the recent beating by paramilitary police of two japanese journalists in kashgar
1422330 this would be utterly unacceptable at any time it is particularly reprehensible just days before the olympics when china had promised complete media openness
1422331 it wouldnt be how we understand the operation functioning no doubt we can clear up the matter quickly
1422332 my face was pushed into the ground my arm was twisted and i was hit two or three times in the face
1422333 this is utterly unacceptable any time its particularly reprehensible just days before the olympics at a time when china has promised complete media freedom
1422334 the japanese reporters violated the rules of china by forcing their way into a military area the act was not well justified and they should accept the consequences
1422335 i however apologize to the reporters as the top regional public security official for the clash they had with the border policemen

1422343 in response we may expand our military presence abroad including in cuba

1422346 his temper would place this country at risk in international affairs and the world perhaps in danger in my mind that should disqualify him
1422347 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic
1422348 i decided i didnt want this guy anywhere near a trigger
1422349 he is a vicious person they so disliked him that they wouldnt support him
1422350 what happens if he gets angry in crisis in the presidency its the presidents job to negotiate and stay calm i just dont see that he has that quality
1422351 john mccain is bob dole minus the charm conservatism and youth
1422352 hardheaded is one way to say it arrogant is another way to say it hubristic is another way to say it too proud for his own good is another way to say it its a quality about him that disturbs me
1422353 it just seems like everything we did john was someplace else in my mind he is not a conservative
1422354 he is the anti conservative he instinctively sides against conservatives and relishes poking them in the eye
1422355 i cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle class americans who most need tax relief

1422358 the board of directors of actavis group would like to thank robert wessman for his near ten year contribution to the group he has been ceo of actavis since 2002 when delta and pharmaco merged and actavis was created previously he had led delta for three years mr wessman has played an important role in shaping and realising actavis vision and executing its successful strategy for growth under his management the company has become one of the five leading generic pharmaceutical companies in the world the board welcomes sigurdur oli olafsson as the new ceo of the company we know that under his leadership the company will continue to provide excellent service to its customers and maintain its role as one of the worlds leading companies in the development manufacturing and sales of high quality generic drugs
1422359 the past years at actavis have been a true adventure im proud to look back at the tremendous growth of the company actavis is now in a solid position as a major global generic pharmaceutical player i would like to thank the whole actavis team for the partnership this incredible group of people has in my mind pulled off an amasing achievement i now look forward to moving on to new challenges where i will focus on my investment company salt investments that has been growing very fast during the past year
1422360 actavis is currently in a strong position among the top five generic pharmaceutical companies in the world it is important to continue the remarkable actavis growth story so the position at the helm is an enormous responsibility to assume im ready for the challenge and look forward to continuing work with our 11 thousand employees on the continued success of the group demand for generic pharmaceuticals is on the rise globally independent of economic cycles the development of new generic pharmaceuticals is among actavis major strengths and i consider it one of our top priorities to use it to further strengthen our position in our key markets in europe north america and asia
1422361 these preliminary data are released upon our being advised that the trial has now reached the point at which more than 50 of the patients have died the overall survival os and disease control rate dcr for patients receiving nimotuzumab compare well with published results in similar patient populations treated with cetuximab a currently marketed egfr monoclonal antibody nimotuzumab also continues to display a safety profile unequalled in its class this low incidence of toxicity with nimotuzumab may be related to differences reported in its interaction with egf receptors compared with other egfr targeting antibodies
1422362 the median overall survival of 9 3 months and disease control rate of 50 together with the exceptional safety profile of nimotuzumab support continuing development of nimotuzumab in patients with colorectal cancer
1422363 the results support further development of nimotuzumab in this setting and trials in metastatic colorectal cancer are high on the list of indications that ym and its licensees plan to develop initially however ym will concentrate on those indications where nimotuzumab can complete pivotal trials in the shortest time within its available resources we intend to file for registration trials in 2008 for patients with non small cell lung cancer nsclc and for those with brain metastases because of compelling observations in phase ii trials in those indications and because they require shorter development times than colorectal trials would require

1422371 gilad shalit has been held hostage for over two years and we must return him and make every effort on this matter we sent him on a mission two years ago and we must bring him home and make every effort
1422372 israel has tried to obtain information in more than one path ashkenazi knows very well that shalit will see the light of day only within the framework of a respectable prisoner exchange
1422373 you are joining the idf in a period filled with challenges in the north and in the south and i think that during your service you will be exposed to some of them
1422374 we will continue to fight over every young man or woman who enlists in the idf since without the willingness of israeli youth who lives and grew up here to enlist it will be hard for us to defend the country and i am happy people understand this

1422376 it is important to see the struggle that is going on now in burlington as part of a larger struggle for media reform here in the united states for voices for more choices and for more diversity it is not that people want to subscribe for al jazeera english so they will follow let us say the politics of al jazeera english they want to get other viewpoints and unfortunately there are not enough diverse viewpoints available on the american television airwaves
1422377 i want to start by saying that im jewish in israel al jazeera english is one of the largest stations in the entire country i sincerely hope that you think in terms of the freedom to listen to whatever is around

1422387 our strong market position enabled us to participate in the class 8 market growth in the second quarter of 2008 however other areas of the commercial vehicle industry continue to impact our results
1422388 we are making progress on our announced initiatives including organic revenue growth in the aftermarket and military continued operational improvements in the components segment and the recovery of raw material costs we are assessing all of our operating assets and cost structures and expect further reductions in costs while maximizing our capabilities to meet the demand requirements of our customers
1422389 we are redoubling our efforts to offset the margin impact of weak industry demand and higher raw material costs with new sales development programs in the aftermarket and military continued operating improvements in the components segment and price increases and surcharges
1422390 however given our limited visibility on the timing of the recovery of commercial vehicle demand including lower expectations in trailer production we feel it prudent to reduce the range of our fiscal 2008 guidance to 85 100 million of adjusted ebitda based on estimated north american class 8 production of 190 000 to 215 000 units and class 5 7 production of 170 000 to 190 000 units however we expect to breakeven in free cash flow for the year due to our continued focus on working capital management and the reduction of capital expenditures
1422391 while the immediate focus is on free cash flow to meet our debt service requirements the longer term opportunity for accurides new management team lies in building more diverse revenue streams adding more profitable engineered solutions and achieving greater asset utilization across the entire enterprise our company is a unique blend of intellectual capital and specialized manufacturing capabilities our job is to unlock greater value from these assets in a way that creates more sustainable growth and higher returns on capital while reducing our financial and operating risks meanwhile the current industry malaise is causing us to reevaluate our position in certain areas we are determined to invest only in those businesses in which we find ourselves competitively advantaged therefore we have initiated a strategic review of all operating assets and cost structures in an effort to reduce fixed costs and redeploy capital more effectively we expect the review to be completed in the third quarter

1422395 i explained to the children the condition of our country it is impossible for the government to set up the ministry because it would increase the burden on the state budget
1422396 maybe we can make it come true only within the next 20 years when our countrys economy has improved
1422397 we urgently need a ministry that deals with childrens affairs as the government has failed to address their problems such as violence and child labour
1422398 we think were making a contribution by coming and saying for heavens sake do you realise what you could do with this money

1422566 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1422567 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1422568 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time

1422603 when they bought the system of course it wasnt defined for a setup like a community clinic
1422604 so there was a lot of additional costs like programming
1422605 we deal with a lot of changes here with state federal and even county regulations so in order to keep up we needed something that could provide a faster turnaround to meet those changes
1422606 i explained to him what open source software was that the codes are free theyre easy to modify and things like that and he actually bought into it he was really surprised to hear about it and so he asked me is there an open source solution for healthcare administration so around 2003 i researched the idea
1422607 but we got grants for different projects like chronic disease management and we were often allowed to incorporate overhead costs into those budgets so we would use those extra monies to develop the clearhealth system
1422608 operation samahan is particularly important to clearhealth because its an fqhc
1422609 they are representative of organizations with fewer resources that are generally on the front lines of the chronic disease crisis in this country their frugality is a good driver of efficiencies and innovations that have impacted the clearhealth system the proprietary systems out there typically focus on features to sell the software and keep organizations from being able to move or interoperate to support their lock in models working with samahan naturally led us to a model that builds features based on tangible benefits in real settings rather than just eye candy in a sales brochure
1422610 as the beta testers whatever clearhealth developed with other clinics was incorporated into our system as well the whole development project cost about 200 000 in total and we didnt have to contribute a penny were getting all these enhancements for free and as part of the deal i helped them start up certain features
1422611 we were able to cope with all the standard changes in billing really easily
1422612 in the meantime we had all these complaints from other clinics who were saying oh my gosh we havent gotten paid in six months because our software vendors are very slow in keeping up with these changes we were so glad that we got out of that system
1422613 were already in the thick of developing the emr side into our system you cant find any system right now at this cost that can give you full emr capability as well as pms so what will happen with these clinics that have only pms on proprietary software is that theyll have to ditch whatever they have now and move to a new system so its more expensive
1422614 were actually in the process of establishing a separate entity of operation samahan that will offer technical services to other clinics
1422615 in fact were already supporting another clinic thats twice our size for their technical needs with my knowledge of megawest i can help them but theyre on the verge of changing their system and theyre looking very hard at their options are they going to a proprietary system that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars we can help them compare the system we have and with all these features to a proprietary system thats five times the cost just to acquire it
1422616 were getting a one week turnaround with our claims now with megawest we would see a two to three week turnaround community clinics dont have that big reserve and one week of delayed payments can cripple your company because thats your bottom line
1422617 at some point the staff were reluctant but then they saw the system
1422618 megawest is actually text based so its all command line driven so i had older staff members who werent very familiar with the mouse and they were saying well i dont know how to use this because its all a graphical interface its not so much open source or proprietary because they dont really know the difference they just see whats on the screen when i showed them clearhealth which is web based the younger staff got it it was zero training for them because theyre very familiar with the internet with the older staff it was just a matter of getting used to the mouse

1422635 last week california governor arnold schwarzenegger ordered a pay cut to minimum wage of 6 55 hr for 200 000 state workers because a state budget hadnt been approved yet the state controller who has opposed the pay cut on principle and legal grounds now says the pay cut he says it would take 6 months to go to minimum wage and 9 months more to restore salaries once a budget is passed the system is based on cobol according to the sacramento bee and the state hasnt yet found the funds or resources in 10 years of trying to upgrade it
1422636 ask her if she likes having saturdays and sundays off if she likes having vacation time and health benefits if she likes working roughly 8 a m to 5 p m rather than say 8 a m to 9 p m does she think many americans enjoy those kinds of benefits and limited work hours because management wants it that way does she not realize that she enjoys a semi humane work environment now because of what unions have pushed for in years past

1422641 california deserves more from its legislators than pursuing flawed legislation state employees are facing pay cuts californias services are being scaled back and anxiety is rising in sacramento to find funds
1422642 rather than tackling real problems affecting californians they chose to waste time money and state resources it is shameful that legislators pursued personal agendas in spite of the facts
1422643 caregivers are not well served by court battles and legal fees rather they would have been far better off if state officials worked together with our industry to raise awareness about video game ratings and the parental controls available on all new game consoles both of which help ensure that the games children play are parent approved
1422644 it is unfortunate that the state is stubbornly pursuing an appeal that is likely to lead to even more court awarded fees

1422674 while theres been no single comprehensive study on the topic there have been many smaller studies that have given every indication that the foreclosure crisis has had a negative impact on homelessness
1422675 seriously tackling the problem of homelessness is going to require taking a look at living wages adjustable to the cost of housing for every working american and will have to require a solution that allows every american to have health insurance

1422700 the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy

1422736 one of the most technologically advanced thorough and scientific methods currently employed to cultivate the black truffle

1422738 high quality truffle trees in volumes suitable for commercial plantations
1422739 rigorous and frequent checking of inoculums to ensure that trees are inoculated with only tuber melanosporum
1422740 when we participated in the recent mushroom festival in cape town a single buyer from the us essentially assured us that he would take everything that we could supply
1422741 in less than ideal conditions however truffle cultivation can still be successful by amending soil conditions and altering plantation practice in response to climatic factors this means a large range of other areas such as eastern cape and kwazulu natal can be utilised as long as climatic factors are taken into consideration
1422742 the most learned of men have been questioned as to the nature of this tuber and after two thousand years of argument and discussion their answer is the same as it was on the first day we do not know the truffles themselves have been interrogated and have answered eat us and praise the lord

1422746 i thought that my task was to produce the fruit and sell it to the agents who would export it or do whatever they wish with it
1422747 i couldnt understand why you have to prepare the crop for 12 months and deliver it to a pack house so that an export agent can brand it as their own without paying for it
1422748 the fact that i must part with my fruit without any deposit so that i can continue farming or have cash flow not even any guarantee of what i will get makes farming nigh on impossible
1422749 government must incentivise all commercial farmers if we are to produce enough food for the country and compete globally as much as we export it is vital to produce more for our country
1422750 these guys taught me a lot about farming citrus of excellent quality for export markets they know far more about farming than i do corporate people taking over new businesses tend to forget about the staff at their peril the workers are your most valuable asset they determine the failure or success of your business

1422773 motorola takes the safety of its products and its customers very seriously

1422790 irish drivers lack of the imagination and awareness sometimes they seem to drive the car while sleeping the most terrible behaviour on the country roads is the driving the car truck or tractor in the middle of the road having the whit line just in the middle between the wheels on the country roads that bend like a snake it is very dangerous especially when many irish people drive fast new cars consumption in ireland is very high typical for the society that used to be poor so there is a lot of accidents the next bad habit typical for irish drivers is almost complete lack of knowledge when the indicators should be used it is so often visible or rather not visible on the roundabouts yet another typical bad behaviour of irish drivers is parking cars wherever they want to stop once in birr i saw old lady who stopped her car on the junction just before the traffic lights she just turned off the engine and went to the shop leaving the car on the regular strip of the street those examples are quite typical and happens regularly
1422791 it doesnt make them perfect drivers but at least makes them better than irish in the terms of driving skills and techniques
1422792 usually when i come back from ireland to poland i have to take care about myself especially when i am crossing the street in poland drivers dont stop when somebody is closing to the zebras pedestrians are to wait not the drivers no body reduce speed if there is no body crossing people on the pavements are not taken under consideration of the polish drivers i saw many times when cars were taking over each other while driving through the crossing places actually polish drivers treat driving as a challenge the other drivers are the enemies and one has to show them who is the best so polish drivers speed a lot take over sometimes 3 cars at the same time etc polish drivers know nothing about the culture of friendly driving so dont expect that somebody will let you go if there is a traffic jam no body will care about you

1422809 you got to take every chance you have just to protect the airways
1422810 its really just taking every precaution necessary who knows how bad its going to be in a few days so if you can resist any air pollution any contaminants then you know its better performance hopefully

1422823 hi were from k swiss you maybe never heard of us but were going into running
1422824 yes we know just who you are we see your shoes all day long people come into our stores to buy running shoes and were taking off their tennis shoes
1422825 we have worked with mattel for more than 10 years and the development of a matchbox version of the evora 1 64 model unfolded at the same time as our first evora was being built so there was a lot of excitement and synergy around the two projects the dramatic plan shape and the distinctive graphical detailing of the real car are perfect for a scale model all the design team grew up with matchbox so it was tremendously exciting to work with the company that is in part responsible for inspiring our interest in car design
1422826 we have a close long standing relationship with lotus and partnering with them to create a matchbox version of the new evora in advance of its introduction was a unique and exciting opportunity for our designers
1422827 the matchbox team was among a handful of people who were privy to the new cars final design our team approached this project with our passion for all things automotive along with a deep understanding of the ethos behind the lotus design
1422828 we are delighted to join forces with sony computer entertainment and polyphony once again on such a special occasion for lotus the launch of the lotus evora is a milestone for us and represents a new and exciting phase of our development id like to thank the gran turismo team for organising this outstanding addition to our exhibit at the british international motorshow and hope guests enjoy the first ride in our evora albeit a virtual one
1422829 we are delighted to secure this limited quantity replica although the rizla colour scheme is no stranger to uk riders this is the very first time an official model has been available in this paint scheme available with full factory aftersales support and through authorised uk dealers
1422830 its luxurious luxurious luxurious i love the interior layout design and access to controls it is user friendly and very modern
1422831 there were some exciting battles at the start and we all had a great time the points will really go a long way to keeping the team in the championship fight
1422832 there were a lot of late nights in preparation for the race and i dont know how they all stayed awake the drivers made no mistakes nor were there any in the pit stops which is fantastic for such a young team
1422833 weve had three podiums in our first five races its unbelievable im so proud of everyone
1422834 the event is just huge i drove a few laps in the thursday night practice and was astounded by how well the car responded on this circuit
1422835 the increased acceptance of greener vehicles such as hybrid and electric vehicles is to be encouraged they have an important role in improving fuel economy and reducing emissions our advanced external sound synthesis technology increases pedestrian safety while retaining the cars environmental benefits we hope that legislators introduce minimum noise requirements for vehicles to encourage the adoption of technologies such as ours which will ultimately increase pedestrian safety
1422836 blind and partially sighted people use the noise of oncoming traffic as a cue for when it is safe to cross a road if a quiet hybrid electric vehicle is approaching then they will no longer have this cue and are immediately put at risk
1422837 as the leading voice on transport and mobility issues in the visual impairment sector guide dogs believes further research and development is needed to address the issues of identifying quiet vehicles for blind and partially sighted people the charity recognises the environmental benefits of these vehicles however more consideration needs to be given to the safety implications to visually impaired pedestrians
1422838 road safety professionals teach children that they can improve their safety by listening for traffic and the sound of an approaching vehicle is a warning that most pedestrians will use before making the decision to cross the road new electric engines make vehicles much quieter so we need to look at ways of ensuring the safety of pedestrians we welcome innovative solutions which address this
1422839 right across the audi range our engineers are delivering significant increases in power and performance all the time and although quattro drive gives many models an invaluable advantage in terms of all weather control prevention remains infinitely better than cure this training is designed not only to ensure that our drivers are equipped with the skills necessary to deploy power as safely as possible on the road but also to enable them to derive maximum enjoyment from it i would encourage everyone enthusiast or not to take the time to come and learn techniques that one day could prove to be life savers
1422840 our leadership and technical experience over the last 25 years make clear volvos commitment to delivering the highest fuel economy for our customers
1422841 improved fuel economy is a key reason why volvo will use selective catalytic reduction scr to meet the 2010 emissions regulations since we expect that scr will improve fuel economy by up to 3 we know that better fuel economy delivers success for our customers reduces u s dependence on imported oil and has very significant benefits for the environment

1422852 california deserves more from its legislators than pursuing flawed legislation state employees are facing pay cuts californias services are being scaled back and anxiety is rising in sacramento to find funds
1422853 rather than tackling real problems affecting californians they chose to waste time money and state resources it is shameful that legislators pursued personal agendas in spite of the facts
1422854 caregivers are not well served by court battles and legal fees rather they would have been far better off if state officials worked together with our industry to raise awareness about video game ratings and the parental controls available on all new game consoles both of which help ensure that the games children play are parent approved
1422855 it is unfortunate that the state is stubbornly pursuing an appeal that is likely to lead to even more court awarded fees

1422952 our job is to try to get the game in
1422953 you do the best you can do at the time i understand players dont want to be out there i dont want to be out there
1422954 look im back there with all that equipment out there no matter what decision you make somebodys not going to be happy to me bell did an incredible job
1422955 a friend of mine gonzalez was killed by lightning this year any of us could have gotten hit and i wasnt going to play again so i sprinted off the field
1422956 everybody was at risk everybody its not like it was just a slippery field and the players had a chance to get hurt everybody was at risk what if that had hit the stands
1422957 there was no need to be out there when the lightning is that close
1422958 theres only two really options if youre out in something like that you either have never seen a lightning storm before or youre a complete idiot
1422959 so i dont want to accuse the people that were hanging out in the stands and stuff of being idiots but i guess theyve never seen lightning well think about it people get killed by lightning strikes all the time its not likely to happen but its a heck of a lot more likely if youre standing outside in a lightning storm its one of those things where the people when a tragedy ends up happening its because people dont have respect for it nobody thats ever been struck by lightning probably thought theyd be struck by lightning
1422960 once berkman told me about biggios friend i was worried
1422961 im not trying to put in on cubs general manager jim hendry or anything like that but whoever is in charge of the cubs and their operations here if it was me when the tornado sirens went off the first time i would have immediately said were not playing this game
1422962 you got reports of severe weather you got to keep some perspective here
1422963 this is a baseball game and these games are important because teams are trying to make the playoffs and everybody understands that
1422964 you put umpires in a bad spot because everybodys like well its on them they got to make the call well i mean theyre getting all kinds of pressure so i dont blame them i think somebodys got to step up in a situation like that and say look yes we all want to win a world series here we all want to make the playoffs but there comes a point and time when youve got to just say stop i guess in our modern day of technology people say oh well the radar says this well im standing outside there and i can see the lightning hit the firehouse 100 yards behind the stadium so i dont need a radar to tell me that

1422968 this is kind of what they were saying earlier with what happened with hurricane alicia
1422969 it was nothing big but as time progressed it became a category 3 hurricane
1422970 ive got water batteries bread canned goods and a couple pieces of fruit just in case
1422971 youve got to in case its a couple of days
1422972 i have a freezer full of food that im going to have to eat
1422973 well probably see a break for a couple of hours through the late morning and early afternoon
1422974 they woke up this morning and saw the chairs in the pool so that was pretty interesting
1422975 he said wed be ok once the storm passed over
1422976 but when we got here and saw people boarding up the windows my wife got a little nervous
1422977 i believe theres a media ten dency to over exaggerate the reality of the truth it scares people who are not from coastal cities
1422978 we want to get it all in today before the storm gets here
1422979 i expect a 40 percent to 50 percent business disruption for two days or more
1422980 on thursday well probably get back in line with normal summer business
1422981 a lot of merchants in the restaurant industry are kind of monitoring their orders so they dont have too much in the refrigerator or freezer that could go bad
1422982 theres always a gray area about what caused what first
1422983 if its a category 4 storm theres usually no one around to see it
1422984 i think in this area they understand a little better than other areas
1422985 pamela still looks fantastic but is clearly determined to look as great as possible on the show
1422986 producers have been informed she has to appear in only flattering lighting and close ups on her face are apparently a no no
1422987 pam has been around this game long enough to know the pitfalls of a bad camera angle
1422988 best thing for this team is for us to part ways
1422989 were at a stalemate mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner roger goodell reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1422990 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it
1422991 he has taken our sins from us as far as the east is from the west
1422992 you and i have a special talent and i saw it immediately
1422993 ive been the substitute person my whole life im not ellen i never wanted to be an ellen and im not cindy either although chucks love me im sure they do i like being alone too much i mean im with a guy whos married to his academic career i rarely see him and im the substitute person there i like it that way its a lot less pressure
1422994 you dont have to make a joke i like you without the jokes
1422995 now would you quit trying to break up with me youre always trying to break up with me and were not even together
1422996 you know there is nothing greater than deciding in your life that things maybe really are black and white and this guy who clearly takes you for granted who serially takes advantage of you is bad and what i am saying is good see what i mean you shouldnt be the substitute for anybody this guy should be right here right now doing this

1423003 every day growing up he said hey if you want to go to the park and play im here for you
1423004 once or twice a week wed go over to the park id shoot penalty kicks on him
1423005 id always try to keep the ball from him and hed always steal it we always battled each other
1423006 at about 14 or 15 i really started watching mls and really got into international soccer trying to emulate the way these guys play and the way they did things
1423007 especially a guy like french world cup winner zinedine zidane who i watched a lot
1423008 ive felt like ever since i was young i was able to see plays a little bit ahead of time i knew what i wanted to do when i got the ball i think that makes the game a lot easier you know whats going to happen next
1423009 it would be a dream to play on a team like that they just keep the ball on the ground and they move it and move it theyve got so many guys who are technical i just really enjoy watching that team play
1423010 im almost there i feel like lately ive been getting in a groove where i feel very comfortable on the ball i feel a lot stronger on the ball i think my decision making has been good ive been working hard every day to make it to that level i want to be in europe soon
1423011 i think those three are not only top flight leagues with some great teams but also fit my style of play i feel like in spain my technical ability would help a lot in germany there are some really good players and its a really strong league from top to bottom so thats cool italy is obviously a very strong league as well
1423012 japan is going to be a very tough team but i think its definitely a team we can go and take three points off of and put ourselves in a real good position
1423013 its a disappointing end to the tournament not to play the climax but obviously we achieved our goal to qualify so were pretty happy
1423014 its going to be great india theyre world champions theyre a great team and to get to test yourself against the best teams in the world is what the world cups all about
1423015 obviously bangladesh would be one of the closest teams to us on a level playing field but theyre still going to be a tough opposition to beat
1423016 we saw that when we went over into their back garden twenty20s another format of the game they wont be easy opposition but were looking forward to it
1423017 im just delighted with how it all went and to be headed to england

1423021 ive given everything i possibly can give to this organization to the game of football and i dont think ive got anything left to give and thats it i know i can play but i dont think i want to and thats really what it comes down to
1423022 theres only one way for me to play the game and thats 100 percent mike and i had that conversation the other night and i will wonder if i made the wrong decision im sure on sundays i will say i could be doing that i should be doing that im not going to sit here like other players maybe have said in the past that i wont miss it because i will but i just dont think i can give anything else aside from the three hours on sundays and in football you cant do that its a total commitment and up to this point i have been totally committed

1423032 its not a legally recognized marriage in the state of utah so to run it as such i find offensive thats no different than running somebody else who decides to live together without benefit of marriage

1423036 the network dvr lets cablevisions digital subscribers record and play back tv programming just as with a tivo and other dvrs only the content is stored on remote servers and not on the hard drives of individual set top boxes
1423037 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
1423038 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1423039 the mobileme launch clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about internet services
1423040 because he thought that lumbar may kill him sometime in the future he decided to kill lumbar first before lumbar could do something to him
1423041 he stayed strong stayed extra long til they let all the other boys out now weve got a real man with an american plan were going to put him in the big white house were all just raising mccain
1423042 i wanted to offer him something that he didnt have a rally song one that really captures that maverick spirit
1423043 the entire world is looking for a way to sucker punch us national security is absolutely at the top of the list of issues thats why i think john mccain is the guy to keep us safe
1423044 this presents products with high sugar or fat content as the devil responsible for obesity but it is more complicated than that people need educating if we are going to put money into anything it should be that
1423045 shes lost another kilo the intravenous drip that she permitted to stabilise her vital signs is not enough so this is fast becoming a life or death situation
1423046 everyday there are some 7 500km of traffic jams on the eus road and the economic cost of congestion could reach 80 billion euros by 2010
1423047 what is missing so far in europe to deploy this new car communication technology is radio frequencies available to allow for this new form of wireless communication
1423048 obviously before this i really hadnt seen or watched much press on china specifically but the olympics have brought a lot of attention to china and their whole economy the whole atmosphere society in general so yes i think this has really created a lot of press for them
1423049 the board has expressed its support for rick wagoner and the gm management team on several occasions and that has not changed
1423050 the board is totally behind rick realizing nobody could deal with this situation any better than he

1423061 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves
1423062 and in total they caused widespread loses by banks retailers and consumers
1423063 one of the most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced
1423064 pickens is not a democrat and is a texas oil man
1423065 he got the endorsment of the govenor of wyoming by promising not to drill there and now hes open to drilling
1423066 however obama himself voted for a 2005 energy bill backed by bush that included billions in subsidies for oil and natural gas production a measure cheney played a major role in developing mccain opposed the bill on grounds it included billions in unnecessary tax breaks for the oil industry
1423067 how katie to show us the beauty in the other
1423068 searched her handbag and found numerous documents describing the creation of explosives chemical weapons and other weapons involving biological material and radiological agents
1423069 included descriptions of various landmarks in the united states including in new york city
1423070 siddiqui was also in possession of numerous chemical substances in gel and liquid form that were sealed in bottles and glass jars
1423071 despite being shot siddiqui struggled with the officers when they tried to subdue her she struck and kicked them while shouting in english that she wanted to kill americans
1423072 french soldiers themselves directly were involved in assassinations of tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis
1423073 could be the basis for potential charges against individuals or the state
1423074 we feel merit selection might make the court system more efficient and accountable
1423075 having judges run for election and raise the amount of money required to run effectively has some serious drawbacks
1423076 thats not to say the elected judges dont apply the law impartially but it just looks bad
1423077 under senator mccains plan the oil companies get billions more we dont pay any less at the pump and we stay in the same cycle of dependence on oil that got us into this crisis
1423078 the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1423079 unfortunately in this election senator mccain has proposed an energy plan thats nothing but four years more of the same
1423080 senator obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america
1423081 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1423082 while americans are hurting barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1423083 it underscores that barack obama isnt being straightforward with voters and has the bad judgment americans cant afford right now
1423084 im just a small citizen of this country im just a businessman i dont remember hearing or seeing anything i just run my business leave me alone
1423085 but i can tell you that this area is safe you can cover the news here without worrying about it
1423086 i dont know who these attackers are i think they come from the countryside but all i know is that its bad for me it scares away the foreign tourists
1423087 i love it here and i want to be part of the team so im happy to have signed my contract

1423097 mas n o nos revemos na sua proposta no valor apresentado e nem sequer nos cumpre coment lo
1423098 o que a aep defende que este processo n o deve ser feito atrav s de propostas avulsas mas sim atrav s de um concurso p blico competindo ao estado definir aquilo que quer obter com a concess o ou seja o pre o justo que est disposto a aceitar
1423099 veremos ent o quais as propostas que v o surgir
1423100 governo come a a fechar a porta a entrega do s carneiro sonae
1423101 s o preocupa es que nos sensibilizam imenso mas evidente que ningu m nomeadamente a regi o norte os seus empres rios e a jmp est interessado em que as companhias low cost fujam de c
1423102 as taxas de crescimento do aeroporto ultrapassaram tudo o que era previs vel e brevemente ser o atingidos os seis milh es de passageiros ano o que foi poss vel gra as vinda das companhias low cost
1423103 n o ser amos n s certamente a matar a galinha dos ovos de ouro afastando do afsc essas companhias isso n o faz qualquer sentido
1423104 trata se de um projecto de enorme interesse para o norte e o facto de aparecerem estas quatro associa es aep associa o industrial do minho associa o industrial de aveiro e associa o comercial do porto e a junta metropolitana do porto todas juntas na defesa deste projecto d a verdadeira medida do significado que n s atribu mos explora o do aut noma do afsc para a regi o e os seus empres rios
1423105 o afsc um equipamento suficientemente importante para ser gerido autonomamente pelo norte e n o pode surgir integrado num monop lio p blico ou privado isto seria mais grave ainda em conjunto com os outros aeroportos do pa s
1423106 n o temos d vida que as outras associa es do norte que j foram contactadas por n s v o aderir a esta posi o
1423107 dada a resposta que o norte deu ao repto lan ado pelo senhor primeiro ministro o governo deve t o quanto entender enunciar os princ pios para abertura do concurso para se aquilatar se h ou n o interessados em pagar o pre o justo pela concess o

1423110 a n no se si voy a estar en esta nueva secuela creo que no he visto demasiado y no me nace un sentimiento de querer estar en ella no estoy seguro de lo que va a ser el film aun no se si va a existir un h roe y un malvado y estas son las cosas que determinan si un film va a ser bueno o no
1423111 we are here to celebrate an unforgettable moment in olympic history
1423112 the decision to award the games to china could not be without challenges we were aware of these although sometimes underestimating some of them
1423113 in the future we need to be more hands on and pro active
1423114 we cannot allow to be hijacked by pressure groups and vested interests
1423115 in my part of the world we were in full boycott mode
1423116 public opinion and political opinion was moving towards an actual boycott of the games and it was only the earthquake tragedy that diverted attention from what could otherwise have been something very very serious
1423117 the games must be read within the context of each nation the ioc and the olympic movement should not be expected to resolve issues outside the games
1423118 we would compromise our mandate and responsibility if we tried to resolve them
1423119 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1423120 we have not yet read the report which has not been sent to us by the rwandan government we are therefore not in a position to react
1423121 the overwhelming nature of frances support to the rwandan policy of massacres shows the complicity of french political and military officials in the preparation and execution of the genocide
1423122 did not challenge the infrastructure of genocide notably the checkpoints manned by the interahamwes
1423123 they clearly requested that the interahamwes continue to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee
1423124 considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes the rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused french politicians and military officials to justice
1423125 and mandates the use of its guidelines and domain name as part of the entry criterion
1423126 when hosting industry awards one of the most important aspects is to ensure they are open inclusive transparent fair and above all independent
1423127 by independent i mean free from influence by outside contributors such as sponsors and media partners naturally headline sponsors should have a say in a number of areas but its important to restrict their influence
1423128 my new line wakes up sleepy skins cells then restructures them
1423129 its taken me 15 years to learn how to wake up the cells thats the secret
1423130 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1423131 california deserves more from its legislators than pursuing flawed legislation state employees are facing pay cuts californias services are being scaled back and anxiety is rising in sacramento to find funds
1423132 rather than tackling real problems affecting californians they chose to waste time money and state resources it is shameful that legislators pursued personal agendas in spite of the facts
1423133 caregivers are not well served by court battles and legal fees rather they would have been far better off if state officials worked together with our industry to raise awareness about video game ratings and the parental controls available on all new game consoles both of which help ensure that the games children play are parent approved
1423134 it is unfortunate that the state is stubbornly pursuing an appeal that is likely to lead to even more court awarded fees
1423135 theyre old crimes but the defense he used the last time that he resigned from the mob doesnt work in this case theres no statute of limitations on murder
1423136 the fundamental question boils down to is the state department using the islamists to advance its agenda or are the islamists using the state department to advance their own
1423137 of course the u s government should pay compensation its the u s militarys fault
1423138 we feel detailed investigation should be done by the u s government itself
1423139 the no gun ri incident became one of the milestones to take on this kind of incident in the future
1423140 u s forces napalmed numerous small buildings and strafed children women and old people in the open area
1423141 there were many similar incidents refugees gathered in certain places and there were air strikes
1423142 everybody came out of their houses to see these low flying planes and everyone was hit
1423143 the u s air force regarded all people in white as possible enemy

1423153 im excited you always want to see how you stack up against the best or the guys that you hear are the best in your age group i would kind of compare it to the canadian hockey league top prospects game you know where you take all the best guys from the three leagues and you get to see them all in games and practice situations that was real good for me to see at the prospects game and i expect the same here

1423207 his interest in surrealism predates his interest in psychoanalysis perhaps lacan never really abandoned his early surrealist sympathies its view of madness as convulsive beauty its celebration of irrationality and its hostility to the scientist who murders nature by dissecting it

1423212 t he mirror stage is a phenomenon to which i assign a twofold value in the first place it has historical value as it marks a decisive turning point in the mental development of the child in the second place it typifies an essential libidinal relationship with the body image
1423213 the mirror stage is far from a mere phenomenon which occurs in the development of the child it illustrates the conflictual nature of the dual relationship
1423214 it is the mother who first occupies the position of the big other for the child it is she who receives the childs primitive cries and retroactively sanctions them as a particular message
1423215 the use of the symbolic is the only way for the analytic process to cross the plane of identification
1423216 it is the world of words that creates the world of things things originally confused in the
1423217 the essential object which is not an object any longer but this something faced with which all words cease and all categories fail the object of anxiety par excellence
1423218 it is only once it is formulated named in the presence of the other that desire appears in the full sense of the term
1423219 that the subject should come to recognize and to name his her desire that is the efficacious action of analysis but it is not a question of recognizing something which would be entirely given in naming it the subject creates brings forth a new presence in the world
1423220 w hat is important is to teach the subject to name to articulate to bring desire into existence
1423221 desire is neither the appetite for satisfaction nor the demand for love but the difference that results from the subtraction of the first from the second
1423222 desire begins to take shape in the margin in which demand becomes separated from need
1423223 desires raison d tre is not to realize its goal to find full satisfaction but to reproduce itself as desire

1423239 wir sind sehr froh dass wir philipps vertrag vorzeitig bis zum 30 juni 2011 verl ngern konnten
1423240 er geh rt zu den vielen talenten in unserer u23 und hat in der saisonvorbereitung bei den profis einen sehr guten eindruck hinterlassen
1423241 ik speel de moeder van baby vrouwen in die tijd hadden een ander soort rol zo was er nog geen sprake van feminisme en dit zie je echt terug in het personage dat ik speel zij was echt een vrouw van de oude stempel dat was voor mij wel even wennen ik word namelijk meestal gecast voor nogal bitchy rollen dus ik moest wel even omschakelen maar ik vond het heel leuk om een keer een heel ander type te spelen al moest ik af en toe wel tot tien tellen want als mijn man me zo zou behandelen dan zou ik hem eens flink de waarheid vertellen en nu moest ik braafjes mijn mond houden behalve in n sc ne waarin ze boos wordt op haar man omdat hij een geheim voor haar heeft gehouden ik vond die sc ne dan ook erg leuk om te doen
1423242 ze is een ontzettend lieve en toegewijde moeder en als ik zelf kinderen zou hebben zou ik ook op zon vrolijke en positieve manier met mijn kinderen om willen gaan
1423243 aangezien ik een ontzettende passie heb voor dans en stel dat dat wordt overgenomen door mijn dochter dan denk ik ah meid geniet ervan en dans er op los het heeft natuurlijk wel met haar leeftijd te maken
1423244 daar zat ik laatst nog over na te denken stel dat ik een dochter zou hebben van een jaar of 10 die is opgegroeid met dat soort pimp videoclips dan gaat ze misschien wel denken dat het normaal is en dat idee vind ik afschuwelijk als ik mijn dochter ooit zou betrappen als ze zich zo gedraagt dan zou ik haar aan haar haren mee naar huis slepen
1423245 ik ben eigenlijk ongelofelijk tevreden met wat ik nu doe ik vind het heel leuk om zoveel mogelijk all round te zijn het is wel zo dat als je in een musical speelt dat zoveel tijd in beslag neemt dat je ook geen tijd hebt voor andere projecten maar ik ben dol op mijn werk ik vind het vooral fijn dat het zo divers is ik bedoel vorig jaar speelde ik een poes in cats en nu een ouderwetse moeder ik hou van die afwisseling
1423246 well tom i hope youre satisfied for helping us lose the election

1423258 whatever i raise from fishing helps me buy our food and expenses for my sister
1423259 but now with an increase in the fuel price there will be nothing left on me
1423260 i just dont know on how i am going to cope
1423261 right now there is just my sister and i at home all the increase in prices is just too much
1423262 i spend about 150 on fuel everyday to go on a fishing trip
1423263 they are only after the audited financial report without taking into consideration the huge fuel price increase as far as the operational cost is concerned
1423264 recently in the strike by bus operators and the laying off of 400 plus bottled water workers the interim prime minister immediately intervened and their problem was solved immediately
1423265 now since we 8000 taxi and hired car operators fiji wide are in trouble will the interim prime minister help us
1423266 this is really really terrible we have little choice but to increase the price of fish if we are to survive our business is largely dependent on fuel and this is a big blow we were still recovering from the previous increases and now this
1423267 we know that labasa has some of the cheapest fish but that has got to change if we are to be commercially viable
1423268 if we increase prices we have to consider the fact that less people might buy
1423269 if we close then a whole industry collapses with us
1423270 we have about 30 suppliers of fish from mali kia and other places and if we close shops where will they go and sell we need the government to step in and do something about this
1423271 now how are consumers going to be able to fork out for that amount we are all going to fork out more for this increase
1423272 many businesses rely on transportation to move around and this increase will also affect them
1423273 despite the increase in fuel we have to carry on despite such obstacles
1423274 the price increase reflects price adjustment for the months of july and august 2008 reflecting the may and june 2008 high world market prices
1423275 pension rates are being reduced from 25 percent to 16 percent this year and 15 percent next year
1423276 ntt2 is concerned that one major distortion exists in the financial market in that the fnpf accounts for about 40 per cent of financial system assets
1423277 the fnpf has been constrained from carrying out international diversification a prudential necessity for the pension fund of a small open economy
1423278 in consequence it has become the dominant investor in government bonds thereby stifling market development the issue therefore is whether fiji is now at a point where the absence of a deeper bond market has become a constraint on the further growth of the financial sector
1423279 the balance between offshore and local investments in the future will have to be carefully considered given that fnpf liabilities are all in fiji dollars but its assets overseas will be subject to foreign exchange rate risk
1423280 the companies made it clear they cannot sustain further losses and they have a point
1423281 these fuel increases are based on may and june prices which were sky high
1423282 there has been relief but that will not be seen here until october as a result of a global phenomena and fiji is not the only country facing this crisis
1423283 that of course will have to be decided at the next cabinet meeting and everyone has to wait until then
1423284 the council is not requesting for the complete removal of duty on fuel rather a reduction even if it is just a few cents
1423285 so for example if a consumer fills about 20 litres of motor spirit he or she will end up paying 48 80 whereas without duty and vat application the actual price paid could be 33 80
1423286 but it has now got to a point where it is difficult to minimise further
1423287 we use about three million litres a year on harvesting and that goes for the three companies
1423288 but we have not come to a stage where we will lay off people
1423289 the interim regime should do something about it because we dont earn as much income as taxi operators in viti levu
1423290 this will definitely affect me and my family and like others we struggle to make ends meet
1423291 we dont need an expert to tell us this its obvious especially in my area
1423292 we spend a significant amount of money on fuel every year
1423293 for a big company like this the new price will have an impact on us
1423294 businesses cannot ignore this for example the price of any good that have to be moved from one destination to another will increase
1423295 i think it is about time the interim government and private sector implement measures to reduce fuel consumption

1423302 senator obamas stance on offshore oil drilling has been mischaracterized he has not changed his position he has continually campaigned against additional drilling calling the policy a gimmick saying it was a scheme and ridiculing those who support it with his steadfast opposition to john mccains all of the above approach to our energy crisis americans should know that barack obama remains opposed to additional domestic oil drilling speaker pelosi moveon org and the sierra club can take comfort from the fact that barack obama still opposes additional domestic oil drilling meanwhile the american people can be sure that john mccain will do what is necessary to reduce this countrys dependence on middle east oil and bring down prices at the pump
1423303 this wasnt really a new position what im saying is that we cant drill our way out of the problem
1423304 if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it this is not real i know its tempting the polls say the majority of americans think its one way well resolve our problems but its not real
1423305 now the latest scheme is well were going to drill offshore now i want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey i understand how desperate folks are i met a guy who couldnt go on a job search that lost his job couldnt go on a job search because of the high price of gas just couldnt fill up his tank i met a teacher in south dakota who loved her job as a teacher on an indian reservation she had to quit because the drive was too far it was taking up too much of her paycheck i know how bad people are hurting so if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it
1423306 last month senator mccain raised more than a million dollars from oil and gas company executives and employees most of which came after he announced his drilling plan in front of a bunch of oil executives in houston this is not a strategy designed to end our energy crisis its a strategy designed to get politicians through an election and thats exactly why washington has failed to do anything about our energy dependence for the last 30 years
1423307 this is a proposal that would only worsen our addiction to oil
1423308 and just like senator mccains gas tax holiday gimmick this is a proposal that would only worsen our addiction to oil and put off needed investments in clean renewable energy

1423314 the reason she got challenged on that was her own doing
1423315 if she had not been out publicly defending his behavior it wouldnt have happened in the first place
1423316 raise whatever he needs for his defense as any mother in this room would do
1423317 there are things that i wish id urged her to do things i wish id said things i wish i hadnt said

1423319 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1423320 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1423321 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1423322 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1423323 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1423324 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1423325 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1423326 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1423327 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1423328 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1423329 this is a major message to america and america is listening
1423330 its really unfortunate that congress left for yet another recess without dealing with pending nominations especially for key officials dealing with energy issues like our nominee for deputy secretary of energy and three nominees to be commissioners of the cftc commodity futures trading commission

1423351 es lamentable la actitud tomada por los pasajeros pero tambi n de los transportistas quienes nunca respetaron el acuerdo que se tuvo en la regi n donde se acord que un pasaje promedio y al alcance de la econom a de los pueblos era de 35 nuevos soles
1423352 han abusado en el cobro de los pasajes por lo que este problema viene desde hace muchos a os
1423353 realmente no sabemos c mo solucionar este problema debido a que las leyes en el per no nos permiten sancionar el alza excesiva del costo de los pasajes lamentablemente los transportistas est n concertando precios pero en favor de ellos mas no del usuario en ese sentido se tiene que hacer una evaluaci n para sancionar este tipo de hechos

1423377 that commodities sell off would probably lower the long term interest rate on mortgages which in turn would diminish the high pressure on the residential market
1423378 the evidence is incontrovertible global warming is occurring if no mitigating actions are taken significant disruptions in the earths physical and ecological systems social systems security and human health are likely to occur we must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now

1423381 fuel demand from the fast growing economies of china and india is more than offsetting oecd demand
1423382 a year on year drop in u s demand of 1 103 000 barrels day huge roughly equal to the production of a super giant oil field or a small producing country like qatar indonesia or azerbaijan a 1 1 million barrel day drop in us demand is gigantic literally enough to wipe out all growth in oil consumption for the entire world which at the moment is running at about 0 9mbd the current iea forecast for 2008 demand growth is 0 89mbd source july 10 omr there is simply no way for china and india who combined have average annual growth of around 0 5mbd to overcome a 1 1mbd drop in us consumption they simply cant grow that fast

1423386 is the improvement in trade due primarily to the weak dollar or to shifts in relative growth rates
1423387 when i visited india in 2001 i was struck by the large number of commercial construction sites where i noticed that earth was being moved by large crews of people carrying dirt balanced on their heads in vessels that about the size shape of a large wok
1423388 i would not declare a recession to have begun unless the indicator rises above 66 so my current assessment is that a u s recession had not yet started as of 2008 q1
1423389 apart from consumer prices another important factor which affects the gdp deflator is the terms of trade which is the ratio of the price of exports to that of imports since it is only the net exports of goods and services i e exports deducting imports that enters into the final gdp figure the prices of exports and imports have offsetting effects on the gdp deflator the price of exports has a positive relationship while that of imports a negative relationship with the gdp deflator thus the movements of the gdp deflator are affected by the relative movements of import and export prices
1423390 without that negative contribution from inventories real final sales grew at a robust 3 8 annual rate
1423391 the most daring project since im pei created the giant glass pyramid 20 years ago
1423392 this will be an opportunity for the french and all visitors to the louvre to see that islam is progress science finesse modernity and that fanaticism in the name of islam is a corruption of islam

1423410 the rapid technological development we are witnessing in these early years of the 21st century together with the forces of globalisation have led to radical changes in the world of work
1423411 like other countries skill gaps in fiji are due to a number of reasons one of which is the demand for skills that are not attained here
1423412 steak v chicken is a gross inaccurate over generalization but if the consumer chooses to purchase a house that shouldnt be reflected in the index do i have that right

1423421 there is also a strong stench coming from the truck there is also seepage from the back of the truck and it is poses a health risk to residents
1423422 the ministry does however acknowledge the need for a greater understanding of the issues by all stakeholders in order for the problems to be effectively addressed
1423423 however when the thefts occur more often over a period of time then the problem becomes a more serious one and more effective measures will have to be taken and students will have to be disciplined the repetitive nature of the thefts at acs resulted in the students being expelled
1423424 stealing is inexcusable and is a behaviour that serves as a strong indicator of something amiss
1423425 is the price of oil today too high given the fundamentals could be is it too low could be but one thing im sure thats too high is the confidence on the part of those who insist they know the answer
1423426 eia also reports that the world as a whole produced 84 6 million barrels of oil per day in 2007 which is 30 thousand barrels per day less than 2005
1423427 i dont think oil will ever get above 250 barrel there are just too many technologies that are more cost effective than oil at 250
1423428 in the long run oil will hit 250 probably sooner than you think
1423429 there are no technologies that can be scaled to produce transportation fuel on the scale of oil not even close
1423430 the nations population center has been moving south and west at a rate of three feet an hour five miles a year
1423431 we have re imported creationism into our political dialogue in the form of
1423432 hillary clinton panders shamelessly to roman catholics who have allied with southern protestant evangelicals on questions of morality with anti abortionism serving as the main bridge
1423433 on foreign policy the realism and internationalism of the eastern elitist tradition once kept the southern frontier warrior culture and wilsonian messianism in check now the latter two in toxic combination have taken over our national dialogue and the easterners are running for the hills
1423434 the transformation is complete right down to the texas accent that no one else in his family seems to have
1423435 crude and products futures are sharply lower as tropical storm edouard is projected to do little damage

1423439 perchlorate is becoming a serious threat to human health and water resources
1423440 the law has been changed thats the material behind the electoral finance bill and legislation and its very sound law
1423441 i was watching television about 11 15 and i heard a car sliding on the highway out in front of our house as i looked out the window i saw it began to flip after it hit our next door neighbors drive
1423442 it went end over end about twice and then it came back on its wheels in the ditch it was a mess
1423443 mr freeman thought he may have gone to sleep but he wasnt sure
1423444 the car was bent on the front as well as rear i mean severely
1423445 it was so bad i couldnt tell what it was

1423447 we need our neighbours to understand that reforms are crucial

1423453 if the child gets a passport and a noc from the government she can be sent to japan
1423454 unless he gets a no objection certificate noc from the government he cant take the baby out
1423455 and of course there is at the moment no clear surrogacy law in india
1423456 if the child gets a passport and a noc from the government she can be sent to japan
1423457 when we went to the passport office officials told us they make passports for indians here
1423458 most working and middle class white americans dont feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race
1423459 its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
1423460 most working and middle class white americans dont feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race

1423462 youre certainly not going to get anywhere without your accreditation

1423465 specifically dedicated to the strategic needs of greater metropolitan auckland
1423466 auckland city continues to undergo significant growth and change by any national or international comparison
1423467 its economic cultural and recreational environment and the events hosted there are significant in scale and influence
1423468 i do not underestimate these challenges but acknowledge that i am fortunate to lead and be part of a committed and dedicated team
1423469 individual sectors all face their own challenges but overall the combination of strong commodity prices growing global food demand and new market developments such as the china free trade agreement signing presents positive opportunities for the primary sector over the next five years
1423470 i asked to talk to a social worker to try and sort something out
1423471 i couldnt even walk to mcdonalds i am disgusted with the treatment and the way my partner and myself were abandoned
1423472 the correct thing to occur here is for this woman if she has a complaint about the service she received to first raise it with us she has not done so and if she is dissatisfied with our response to pursue it through formal channels
1423473 i thought it was a very good thing for all of us and hopefully it will be proven in the next couple of weeks what a good thing it was
1423474 ive been getting on with my job hes been getting on with his so we havent had a lot to do with each other
1423475 technically we had a few things to work through but right from the start it felt fast
1423476 we get on very well as people and its just a case of making the blades go in the water and out at the same time
1423477 hes impressed me the further weve got into the season his athleticism is a great attribute but what stands out most to me is his attitude its just first class in every way
1423478 we want to come down course as fast as we can and well be hard to beat if we do that
1423479 im aiming to improve every day making myself as good as i can be for the final if i have my best race then then im going to be hard to beat
1423480 we didnt realise weve lost a lot of speed its frustrating its a simple sport you think and why cant we do what we were able to a year ago
1423481 the proposed scheme will provide direct benefits to upper south island communities and indirect benefits to the rest of new zealand through the freeing up of electricity currently imported into that region for more efficient use elsewhere
1423482 we remain committed to the expansion of super rugby and wholeheartedly support the arus stance regarding this matter
1423483 sanzars current position is that it is a very much a three country expansion of super rugby with south africa involved
1423484 the transtasman idea does not include south africa and that is absolutely not the nzrus preferred position at the moment
1423485 in all honesty when i first came in i said to aaron scott the regular skipper and stu jacobs the team coach that i felt a bit awkward just coming in because obviously these guys have been together a long time and deserve what they have got
1423486 the guys presented their case and there is no animosity so in the end it was whatever is best for the team
1423487 ryan took a session yesterday afternoon and the things you learned from it were invaluable
1423488 i think i feel oldest in the warm ups when all the boys sprint off and i just need a few minutes but they have made me feel really welcome
1423489 pamela still looks fantastic but is clearly determined to look as great as possible on the show
1423490 producers have been informed she has to appear in only flattering lighting and close ups on her face are apparently a no no
1423491 pamela has been around this game long enough to know the pitfalls of a bad camera angle
1423492 there is no evidence that i have ever heard of any pakeha women in new zealand at that time
1423493 it would be unusual to be this far south unprecedented
1423494 the material given by the home ministry is insufficient so the ban cannot be continued
1423495 we will examine on what technical grounds the ban has been lifted we are studying the order and will see that everything is done
1423496 i dont think so we are on the job and i feel our efforts to tackle terror groups will continue
1423497 the lifting of the ban on simi is a moral victory for us the notification issued by the government was wrong but a hitch still remains about its functioning as it is still listed as a terrorist organisation
1423498 what precluded the government from stating the facts you have to satisfy the tribunal about the sufficiency of the reason behind issuing a fresh notification on the ban
1423499 those who do not respect the party and give priority to their self interest can have no place in the party
1423500 should be identified as early as possible and expelled from the party
1423501 some are saying that friends are above the party and even if friends become enemy of the party the tie should continue this notion cannot go on it has to be stopped
1423502 this government was not working for the common masses but only for one person
1423503 this document is meant to move fiji forward so we really want to look ahead for the sake of the nation and the people
1423504 we have offered to adopt the baby and ensure that it is bought up well and the mother need not have any concern on that score the church very clearly takes a clear and strong stand about the abortion we are totally against it
1423505 the ministry of labour staff need to be gathering more comprehensive data to present to the wages council so that an improved decision can be made by the councillors
1423506 a major cause of the long term deterioration of real wages is the systematic pattern of long delays by wages councils before new wage regulations orders wros were issued
1423507 when you increase the orders this would mean more meetings more collection or data compilation of documentations
1423508 there was a minor hiccup and we just had to prioritise our agenda of the first meeting as we also had the minister mr lekh ram vayeshnoi speaking
1423509 production costs are so high the price of reaping and harvesting and the additional costs of pesticides and fertilisers are additional costs and when we tally all of it up we find that our expenses almost equal the income that we get we are even lucky if labourers come and harvest our rice for 10 a day
1423510 they now demand 15 so these are the additional costs for rewa rice to take into account when setting rice prices
1423511 when we really consider it a tonne of rice is about 600 to 750 kg after milling and for us to receive only 643 for a tonne of paddy means we get only about a 1 for a kilo of rice
1423512 that is way less than the price being paid for a kilo of imported rice
1423513 we get about 1 80 for that so it is quite reasonable for us to sell our rice to others rather than rewa rice
1423514 paris is the city in which one loves to live sometimes i think this is because it is the only city in the world where you can step out of a railway station the gare see simultaneously the chief enchantments the seine with its bridges and bookstalls the louvre notre dame the tuileries gardens the place de la concorde the beginning of the champs elysees nearly everything except the luxembourg gardens and the palais royal but what other city offers as much as you leave a train
1423515 we are hoping for i use the word clean exemption we hope nsg will recognise and accept the moving pieces the 123 agreement change of us law and so on and gives approval to this
1423516 the us is raising this question with all the nsg countries
1423517 the government is keen to convene the session immediately to take up the legislation to provide social security and other welfare measures to the unorganised sector but the government wants to bring back normalcy in troubled areas
1423518 i would call upon the government to convene the monsoon session at the earliest so that important issues facing the country including the terror situation jammu and kashmir and price rise could be discussed
1423519 the upa government has full faith in parliament but we do not want to be distracted in our attempts to bring peace
1423520 i only went out for a walk and finally concluded to stay out till sundown for going out i found was really going in
1423521 you know what the trouble about real life is theres no danger music
1423522 the dead long dreamed of playing at the foot of the great pyramid
1423523 the two cds contain 18 tracks featuring more than three hours of music
1423524 they had some type of smoke or odour in the cabin
1423525 the captain elected to declare an emergency and get everybody out of the aircraft via the slides
1423526 and thus far found no evidence of an active fire
1423527 whats startling to us is as we get to a point where we feel weve addressed a specific complaint and a specific issue we identify additional issues
1423528 ucla should have detected the violations by ms jackson years ago and should have immediately initiated the process to dismiss her

1423544 we know too that many people in the over 40 age group arent good at taking care of themselves theyve simply not had the safer sex messages that young people have been getting
1423545 things have changed a bit since the first time around
1423546 when you meet someone as much as you trust them they may have trusted someone else in the past who they perhaps shouldnt have at what point do you do what when do you go rushing in
1423547 guys almost take it that youre questioning their credibility if you ask about their sexual health

1423552 obama is a tad cooler than mccain on probably 57 fronts said emily goulding 25 of los angeles
1423553 obamas better looking than mccain obamas more stylish than mccain obamas more fit than mccain he refers to better music than mccain
1423554 obamas big with the kids everyone knows that said tom johnson 21 of norfolk va
1423555 mccain that guys not cool i just cant call mccain cool
1423556 its got to be obama said david munn 20 of keene n
1423557 hes younger i think he has more of a connection with my generation i just think he communicates better to my generation especially with issues in iraq mccain is all right but not as cool as obama
1423558 cool thing down hes an avid basketball player listens to jay z on his ipod and was on the cover of this months issue of rolling stone magazine
1423559 illiterate when it comes to using a computer he turns 72 next month and if elected hed be the oldest president in american history to begin his first term
1423560 coolness or the perception of it at least really matter to young voters
1423561 i dont think you can ignore that factor said james kotecki a 22 year old political video blogger who achieved fame on youtube last year after he interviewed former republican presidential candidate ron paul in koteckis georgetown university dorm room
1423562 what obamas been able to do is capitalize on his hipness at least as far as younger voters go said kotecki whose video commentaries now appear on politico com the website for the washington political newspaper
1423563 i think its not that they dont support his issues and his policies but younger voters are more willing to work for him and work passionately for him because hes someone who resonates more on their wavelength
1423564 coolness is often associated with youth but elder status doesnt automatically signify
1423565 you can certainly be cool at any age kotecki said
1423566 look at hugh hefner hell be cool til the day he dies but for him and for ron paul or anybody whos elderly and whos cool part of it is what they represent that makes them that
1423567 the most important thing in terms of reaching youth is not being cool its being authentic or true to who you are goodstein said
1423568 i think hed look ridiculous if he tried to purposefully seem younger than he is if he started doing extreme sports or something ridiculous
1423569 has a very conservative image and that doesnt really help him either souris said
1423570 shes not the type like obamas wife who can get down and dirty with younger people and really relate to them
1423571 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1423572 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1423573 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1423574 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1423575 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1423576 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1423577 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence
1423578 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1423579 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1423580 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1423581 the issue of screening for prostate cancer is frankly an area of medicine that remains somewhat unsettled
1423582 while its clear there is benefit to a significant number of men its equally clear that many men end up being diagnosed and treated for cancers that would likely not have caused them any significant harm
1423583 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1423584 thats because every 75 year old is not created equal
1423585 very active very vigorous and have minimal health issues and many of those men are going to live into their late 80s or 90s
1423586 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1423587 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction

1423591 se requiere que el gobierno de luz verde yo le puse luz roja
1423592 im actually grateful for the struggles weve endured because they brought me to truly understand whats important to me time with family the ability to work from home doing something i enjoy and am good at gradually working toward a clutter free home and debt free lifestyle and ill tell you this it isnt stuff
1423593 we werent even spending money on things that we really wanted we were just spending money because the money was there
1423594 living a frugal life will enable us to have a life a life we really want not a life obsessed with material things
1423595 when i make sure to focus on my efforts as being contributions rather than any kind of deprivations my resulting feelings are peace and contentment within myself and a greater sense of being a participating part of a beautiful
1423596 theres no way im going to mortgage my future away for stuff that i wont care about by then i want to live well all my life not just the first half of it

1423602 the executives from nortel were phenomenal because they inspired me to think about what life can hold i thought it was interesting to hear them tell us about their lives what really got my attention was hearing how you could have a life changing experience just through networking
1423603 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program

1423609 if only i would grow up and practice what i preach lol
1423610 75 of those polled think that yes jen does in fact need to grow up already preferrably before it is time for her to grow old
1423611 its kind of like if you have a car on a hill
1423612 you pick up energy as youre going down but you give it all back up again when you go up
1423613 is that the acceleration of the universe is forcing the gravity wells to be less strong so over the time it takes for energy to cross the cluster the strength of the cluster has diminished
1423614 in the last six or seven billion years the expansion of the universe has switched over from slowing down to speeding up meaning that dark energy is becoming more dominant in controlling the growth of the universe
1423615 as the universe expands matter gets more and more dilute and dark energy gets more and more dominate
1423616 something probably military and anti air defense star nkvd of ussr pre war soviet intelligence and police service
1423617 there exists a positive number large than 2 on the real line
1423618 there exists an irrational number which when raised to an irrational power will be rational
1423619 ganz sicher um diese zeit kann ich das und das machen
1423620 the lowest number we have seen and probably the lowest in at least the last quarter century
1423621 it comes almost entirely as a consequence of newsroom budget cuts by companies seeking to bolster their shrinking profit margins during an economic downturn
1423622 its a given that youll see more cuts in staffing fewer reporters covering city halls state capitals washington and the world
1423623 and people know that they know that if one company owns most of the media outlets in their town in their state or in the country as a whole they are going to get a one size fits all news that is a lot more likely to serve the people in power than it is the public interest and democracy
1423624 perhaps the single most negative development in journalism in my lifetime
1423625 just became an article of faith among a lot of people look at this white house press corps its just abdicated all responsibility
1423626 i talked to people everywhere i went who said that if the media especially the television media had done its job there wouldnt have been a war
1423627 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
1423628 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
1423629 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
1423630 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
1423631 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
1423632 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
1423633 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
1423634 the effect of this book on me was to make me like ammon shea and briefly to hate english what a choking god awful mash it is surely french is better then i recovered and saw its greatness afresh the o e d shea notes is a catalog of the foibles of the human condition shea has walked the wildwood of our gnarled ancient speech and returned singing incomprehensible sounds in a language that turns out to be our own

1423638 mi sento un idiota ma almeno mi pago la residenza estiva
1423639 i consider it a great honour to play for my province so to be asked to captain the side makes it even more special
1423640 it will be a good build up and pre season training has gone well and we are all looking forward to the start of the magners league next month
1423641 were delighted john has accepted the captaincy for the 2008 09 season hes a player who has always led from the front based on his workrate in training and on matchday
1423642 he has developed into a key player in the squad over the past number of seasons and has been excellent for us both in terms of his consistency of performances and his strength of character
1423643 invece stata scritta e sar eseguita personalmente nel film da
1423644 best thing for this team is for us to part ways
1423645 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner roger goodell reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1423646 mike told me hey were a better team with you on it but wanted to know if i have a problem with an open competition
1423647 i dont have a problem with competing you know that but aaron should be the starter right now because hes been out here all this time this is more than about an open competition and i can do that absolutely but this is going to be mass confusion and thats not good for this team
1423648 ill practice my butt off if it comes to that and i think we all know what the end result will be but this probably isnt going to work
1423649 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it
1423650 so they can say they welcome me back but come on the way theyve treated me tells you the truth they dont want me back so lets move on i dont know where its headed well see
1423651 i think we made it a little harder on ourselves by not moving the ball around as much
1423652 we didnt make our outside shots tonight as well as weve been in the past but at the end of the day we won the ballgame we found a way to win
1423653 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ballgame
1423654 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
1423655 we just broke down we gambled a couple of times and allowed them to make the extra pass
1423656 we cant have those type of mental breakdowns because these teams can really shoot the ball
1423657 what theyve done and where you see them can intimidate a lot of people
1423658 i think to come into a game intimidated youve given up before you start and we didnt feel like we did that tonight
1423659 we respect the commissioners decision and the thoroughness of the process
1423660 we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making our focus has been and continues to be on our football team and having a successful season
1423661 i have a pretty good idea how that article went down but you can shape the environment however you want one way or the other
1423662 ive just got to go out and do my part if it happens it happens if it dont it dont
1423663 theres just so many different things and you hear something new every day
1423664 i still know a lot of people over there so i follow them its the craziest situation youve ever seen
1423665 those standards are fairly tough to meet but in many respects the beijing area does so
1423666 im sure im confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in beijing
1423667 you got to take every chance you have just to protect the airways
1423668 its really just taking every precaution necessary who knows how bad its going to be in a few days so if you can resist any air pollution any contaminants then you know its better performance hopefully
1423669 i am certain that it was in no way intended to be disrespectful
1423670 it is an athletes choice however it didnt seem to be necessary today
1423671 we will evaluate those and should problems arise we may have to take some action
1423672 exaggeration of the problem that has been seen in the media
1423673 to come to a city even though the air quality might be inferior the long term effects should no longer be feared by temporary visitors
1423674 the mist in the air that we see in those places including here is not a feature of pollution primarily but a feature of evaporation and humidity
1423675 we do have a communication problem here once the misconception has become sort of established in the minds of people its not that easy to get the right message through
1423676 although the two first days suggested some measurements a little above the interim target they have now gone down and we are steadily below the interim target
1423677 i welcome the opportunity to lead this company into the future while working to create a successful independent mobile devices company that will continue to innovate and grow for years to come
1423678 oh that delaware liberal they are anti catholic i dont read them
1423679 the most damaging occurrence in the history of the international republican institute
1423680 last night led by every sector of civil society the venezuelan people rose up to defend democracy in their country
1423681 in reality that day i did not see the ch vez supporters firing at the opposition march
1423682 we do not know what charges if any have been filed against them
1423683 he was operating without a legal framework and ruling by decree a move condemned by many regional leaders and the international community
1423684 the united states did not participate in inspire encourage foment wink at nod at close its eyes to or in any way leave the impression that it would support a coup of any kind in venezuela
1423685 represented an important step for the opposition which had been quick to condemn ch vez but had so far offered no vision of its own
1423686 dissident military factions are stepping up efforts to organize a coup against president ch vez possibly as early as this month to provoke military action the plotters may try to exploit unrest stemming from opposition demonstrations slated for later this month
1423687 the institute has served as a bridge between the nations political parties and all civil society groups to help venezuelans forge a new democratic future
1423688 by welcoming the coup indeed without any apparent reservations you unnecessarily interjected iri into the sensitive internal politics of venezuela
1423689 during the six month period november 2001 april 2002 ned the state department and dod provided training institution building and other support programs totaling about 3 3 million to venezuelan organizations and individuals some of whom are understood to have been involved in the events of april 12 14
1423690 has made a concerted effort to improve communications between political leaders in both the united states and venezuela this included hosting a briefing by francisco arias cardenas in washington d c and meetings and communications with u s government policy makers
1423691 the current political situation in venezuela and appropriate state department responses
1423692 need for better communications with the venezuelan press which often times speaks negatively of the united states policy
1423693 as chavez became more aggressive a once polarized and fragmented opposition was becoming more unified
1423694 increasing ungovernability and intimidation by the chavez government against civil society groups
1423695 new attempt to get to know party leaders who have publicly split with the chavez coalition government
1423696 there was a popular uprising that was betrayed by a lack of leadership political parties were absent from these developments and civil society and the business sector were not prepared to govern the country
1423697 contrary to what is widely perceived as premeditated removal of ch vez from office concheso felt that the april 11 events were spontaneous
1423698 surprised by pedro carmonas decision to dissolve the congress and disband the supreme court
1423699 believes these decisions were not carmonas and that he was forced to make them

1423707 the banks are playing all sorts of accounting gimmicks not to recognize them
1423708 todays commission decision is a decisive step towards meeting the european goal of reducing road accidents getting critical messages through quickly and accurately is a must for road safety
1423709 we should also keep in mind that with 24 of europeans driving time spent in traffic jams the costs caused by congestion could reach 80 billion by 2010 so clearly saving time through smart vehicles communications systems means saving money
1423710 something that i have not seen mentioned on this list nor in any of the media is that jim david adkisson and his ex wife liza alexander were participants at suusi southeast uu summer institute
1423711 much of the media is painting this as a somewhat random attack on a uu congregation with only a brief mention that his ex wife was a member of the congregation in the past one person on the suusi list wrote
1423712 david was not a stranger to uu ism some of the comments ive seen suggest that he is seen as your average angry ditto head who decided to take his anger out on the highly visible liberal religion choosing that church for its banners
1423713 its all too easy to imagine that could happen again except that it doesnt seem to have happened the first time
1423714 maybe we dont live in a world where someone would target a church simply because of its social action work and its core beliefs
1423715 if i cant have you no one else can either

1423787 photographers moved into apartments next door to us and we really found ourselves kind of living like a spy movie i feel like they think they have to be there like they punch in or something
1423788 morgan est bien despu s de su cirug a de anoche para reconectar nervios y reparar los da os en su brazo y mano izquierda

1423793 reduced ice thickness in arctic transpolar drift favours rapid ice retreat
1423794 clearly the thinner ice cover favours a stronger areal retreat of the ice during summer
1423795 points to the possibility of further rapid reductions once that vast uniform region has thinned further below certain thresholds
1423796 the arctic sea ice cover has transitioned into a different climatic state where completely ice free summers would soon become normal
1423797 nevertheless it is perhaps too soon to make a definitive pronouncement concerning this years probable extent at the summer minimum
1423798 the arctic sea ice is in a condition we have not seen since satellites began taking measurements thin ice is much more vulnerable to melting completely during the summer it seems likely that we will see a faster than normal rate of decline through the rest of the summer
1423799 youve never seen the olympics in a market that has such domestic commercial scale
1423800 when the olympics were in los angeles and atlanta the u s market was already fully developed
1423801 anglophones and francophones made it clear bilingualism is at the heart of who we are
1423802 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1423803 the overwhelming nature of frances support to the rwandan policy of massacres shows the complicity of french political and military officials in the preparation and execution of the genocide
1423804 did not challenge the infrastructure of genocide notably the checkpoints manned by the interahamwes
1423805 they clearly requested that the interahamwes contine to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee
1423806 considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes the rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused french politicians and military officials to justice
1423807 el mensaje entregado hoy no es la respuesta de ir n a las seis naciones
1423808 como ya hemos dicho si no recibimos una respuesta clara un mensaje claro de su parte no tendremos otra opci n que estudiar medidas adicionales

1423813 poco despu s del comienzo de la reuni n el capit n escuch a una mujer gritando desde la cortina y cuando se dio vuelta vio a siddiqui con el rifle del oficial en sus manos y apuntando directamente al capit n

1423818 our embassy is of course gathering information from the authorities
1423819 i believe there is no mistake so we plan to protest strongly
1423820 it is extremely unfortunate that a working reporter who followed the correct procedures should be the victim of violence
1423821 it is historys sorrow the grief of our era that i carry about me like an anathema
1423822 optimist a firm believer in the force of willpower with an unquenchable thirst for life and incredible powers of concentration
1423823 he felt positively uncomfortable without a hair shirt of some kind
1423824 the spiritual impotence that comes from living a life of ease
1423825 for the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature
1423826 i came with a very sad dark idea of the country
1423827 because hip hop rap music or rap celebrities have promoted this fashion trend to be cool i wanted to use the same approach in rap music to make it uncool and educate saggers on what saggin truly means
1423828 the alignment focused organization bridging the gap between strategy and execution
1423829 my bitter divorce with heather will never feature in my music
1423830 the main theme is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
1423831 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part there are so many celebrities that soapbox their opinions and people believe its more valid because theyre popular
1423832 for us people are people you should all have your own opinion we are hopefully putting the human element in what is an unfortunate part of life there are people over there dealing with situations like this and were showing the human part of being there
1423833 we want to be really plain about what our issues are with the movie
1423834 solving the problem this isnt solving a problem this is adding a felony on top of the problem
1423835 you know i picked up a couple magazines vanity fair and people whats your preference

1423839 i will say this to you when they brought to my attention that those materials were in the newspaper they had to scrape me off the roof because thats not why you know those were given to him howard and it was made plain and clear to him that thats not why they were given to him
1423840 were kind of stuck in the middle of this thing
1423841 you know provide transportation dont provide transportation they you know stick us in the middle and we shouldnt be in the middle basically
1423842 that he believed would be provided to the media by the executive chamber
1423843 were part of the executive department we have to live with that
1423844 they changed a lot of things from the old way of doing business we had to live with that you know its just a fact of life
1423845 what i made clear was this is not a foilable document
1423846 this is just a fun way for me to say hey boys im still here
1423847 the people who bought the homes say well we love looking into your yard and seeing the horses and the cattle but we dont like the flies and we dont like the mosquitoes and when i cut my field to bale it they say we dont like the dust in the air
1423848 i respect that theyre here and spent a lot on their homes but on the other hand give me a little bit too ive been here since i was 7 years old
1423849 ive talked to my neighbors and worked things out i really just thought this would be a funny thing to do
1423850 these can come out just as easy as they went in
1423851 so do all the other splendid buildings in washington d c for you are a citizen of the united states
1423852 engaged in bizarre antics that your average zegna clad washington lobbyist would never have dreamed of
1423853 sees that banks are safe places for people to keep their money
1423854 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1423855 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
1423856 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
1423857 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
1423858 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
1423859 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
1423860 an individual really doesnt have the opportunity to set up things so their genetic information pervades the gene pool a long time in the future
1423861 if i were to take 100 random mongolians and follow their family lines i wouldnt have seen anything special

1423867 you wont hear me say this too often but i couldnt agree more with the explanation that mccain offered a few weeks ago
1423868 he said our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been 30 years in the making what mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil

1423874 i feel it is a right of women to be able to give birth safely and when a woman is hiv positive the baby can obviously have the virus transmitted before being born
1423875 i think this is a fundamental human right for every woman to have access to treatment and health care so this is something that im actually addressing and talking about while we are here
1423876 we want to lift a loud voice to change our food system
1423877 we need to change the ways we grow distribute and eat food which needs to be good clean and fair things are at a crisis point with respect to health and the environment
1423878 we have been talking about a vegetable garden on the white house lawn this would be a way to talk about stewardship and nourishment thomas jefferson had such a garden
1423879 a big message of slow food nation is that we all need to be planting gardens
1423880 we need to have more greenhouses in the future whether it gets too hot or too cold
1423881 if you want to help grind up large quantities of gravenstein apples to make fresh juice drink lots of juice join a pot luck bbq lunch and get covered in apple pulp come on over

1423886 slow food is the opposite of fast food it is food that comes from local sustainable farms
1423887 we intend to raise awareness about the profound effects of our food choices on the environment on our health and on issues of social justice
1423888 the current industrial model will soon fail for its heavy dependency on homogeneity and petroleum as such slow food is about survival
1423889 on a long 200 person table for a meal curated by outstanding in the field
1423890 26 dynamic presentations on topics ranging from the viability of rare breeds to the nuts and bolts of engaging our isolated urban and rural communities in the sustainable food movement
1423891 lay the groundwork for more concrete inclusive and effective collaboration in the sustainable food and farming movement
1423892 the clash of ideas critical thinking from incisive minds and inspiring dialog
1423893 more people are thinking about what they eat these days
1423894 im proud to be a small part of this movement with a vision for a better food system it can help activate people to work to change food policies
1423895 i went to slow food nations parent terra madre in italy
1423896 it was life changing i plan to go to slow food nation because i do not want to miss another chance for a life changing event
1423897 terra madre was a heart event it was a thrill to see families still making the food they have made for centuries you feel this human thing it was very emotional and made me cry some recipes for corn bread for example had been handed down for twenty generations
1423898 i love the apple farmers here in sonoma county they are courageous there is a history here that we need to remember
1423899 slow food is an opportunity to re connect with our food and local growers and to understand the plight our planet is in our immunity and the immune system of the earth are linked building from here is a source of our healing
1423900 it helps create a sense of what real nourishment is it brings farmers children and the community back into the food system rather than leaving it in the hands of large corporations slow food encourages people to grow and cook their own food and remember the pleasure in that
1423901 it was intense being around people from over 150 countries in their traditional dress who have this common bond and language of the land growing food preserving local food cultures preparing serving and nourishing others
1423902 they have a delicious heritage bean they so inspired me that i bought them as christmas presents and included information about slow food
1423903 i traded them for tomatoes of which i have many
1423904 we need to do more foraging and gleaning lots of food is wasted on the ground which is very edible
1423905 have a long history yet are mostly ignored by the culinary mainstream
1423906 weve been writing a declaration and petition calling for a new national food policy
1423907 when kids grow and cook their own food they all want to eat it
1423908 they want an interactive education they are happy to be in the garden kids are not just hungry for food they are hungry for people to take care of them and for nature
1423909 we are sorry that toots is unable to continue his role with the team even though toots commitment to us was considered part time he certainly was a valuable member of our staff and contributed greatly
1423910 but something else surprised me how much you can love an adopted child the same as you can love a biological child i didnt anticipate that

1423914 they had to blast me twice and get me started all over again
1423915 the other day the guy guard tripped and fell with his gun on him it could have gone off and had fatal consequences it is inconceivable that tom hanks who claims to be the voice of the little people could tolerate this
1423916 morgan you just dont even sweat it you get better were thinking of you were waiting for you baby
1423917 im not a doctor which brings me to another point it seems like the media is often giving celebrities and actors more authority on this issue than theyre giving the experts and thats a sad fact
1423918 and i know thats a paradox thats part of why i wanted to become a spokesperson so i could say please dont listen to me dont listen to the actors go to the experts

1423974 sticking to what is traditional taxi service in georgia is one of the most prominent ground transportation service that one can utilize after an all day traveling through the airplane with the vast majorities and varieties of car services around georgia like limousines shuttles and other car fleets many still prefer to have the ideal means of transportation and that would be taxi services being in the car service business for a long time taxis and cabs are really considered as good ways of touring in and out of georgia in georgia taxi services mostly services as private rides to and from airports and hotels a taxi ride driven by a professional driver knowledgeable with all the ins and outs in airports and all over the place will definitely be a very reliable private ride that one can avail service from it will also surely serve as a good touring ride and dependable car service that one can rely on especially in instances that important meetings and business appointments are at stake with the various limousine and car service companies that have mushroomed all over georgia one should certainly be very picky when getting a private taxi service to accommodate him or her for the tasks he or she is about to attend to for the day some of these car service companies offer services like private transportation including airport pick ups hotel drop offs airport transfers and even during special events and occasions that people need to be present at however picking the most appropriate georgia cab service present within the country in fact has been very difficult today because of the reason that thousands of car service companies are all over the place in addition with the dilemma of choosing from hundreds and even thousands of choices distinguishing one from the other is also very tough thats why when getting a cab service one must always be aware that doing background checking about the company you are about to avail service from is the key factor to be able to be certain at all times two good ways of doing this is through inquiring to the transportation department where the company is registered and checking their records simply through the internet a private taxi service in ga will definitely help a lot to be able to get to those places that one must attend to as soon as possible but when one made a wrong selection the trip will surely be a hassle all throughout important schedules will surely be interfered because a having a poor taxi service and no one would want to experience something like this therefore when getting the service one needs he or she must be very wise also with the goal of avoiding experiencing disturbances that sometimes might get into his or her nerves with the varieties of georgia airport transportation service available like those limos shuttles taxis or cabs if one wants it in a more ideal way preferring a taxi or cab ride is a good option however one must be very wise at all times to be able to experience the relaxation and comforts he or she deserves while traveling it is a must to take into consideration that making sure of the credibility and reliability of the car service company best serves as a basis on how to be certain on the car service one needs to avail

1423987 real ale is a natural living product so there is a much greater intensity of flavours
1423988 one of our objectives is to get people to try it there are fruit beers wheat beers porters stouts milds and golden ales its incredibly diverse so theres something to meet everyones tastes
1423989 pasteurising and filtering a beer kills off a lot of the natural flavours
1423990 a processed keg beer is completely inert a dead flat liquid drawn up to bar with carbon dioxide to put some life in it thats why theyre so fizzy compared to a real ale
1423991 golden brown session beer full bodied with an aroma of floral hops initial malty flavour fades as citrus and hops take over leading to a hoppy bitter finish
1423992 its one of the hardest beers to brew because there are fewer ingredients in it and weve managed to put a lot of flavour into a low alcohol beer and keep it consistent

1424031 it was the kind of thing where the cia said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forth a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1424032 one of the greatest lies in modern american political history
1424033 its on the record its in the book and people can read it for themselves
1424034 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help make our case
1424035 bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office nothing was going to stop that
1424036 in the book youll see people who are involved and talking about the debate and it was quite a fierce debate at the highest levels of the government is habbush reliable whats he saying how can we check it
1424037 and a lot of people at the end of the day said it was hard for him to prove the negative that what he said was no weapons were actually not there thats hard to do
1424038 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operation link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade
1424039 a handwritten letter with habbushs name on it would be fashioned by cia and then hand carried by a cia agent to baghdad for dissemination
1424040 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationery and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals and saying you may not like this but here is our next mission
1424041 and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish
1424042 is really concrete proof that al qaeda was working with saddam
1424043 it is in my opinion true that the administration for whatever reason was determined to have a showdown with iraq that predated this whole wmd stuff
1424044 well you know a lot of them have been walking around with this lump in their chest for a couple of years five years now
1424045 and because theyre essentially free theyre not the original source they said look why hide now
1424046 id done this sort of thing for a while and the way it worked was there were off the record sources who played out the story and then i went to people actually involved
1424047 they were freed up because theyre not the original source if you will to sort of talk about the context what they felt what they did and the people actually involved and of course theyre all through the book on the record talking about how it all worked

1424205 in these warhol photos you can see exactly what warhol is about dark spaces a reflective ceiling and no natural light
1424206 still you wonder if the humility of the nicholas serota photo is genuine or just a good publicity shot
1424207 for me the photograph is revealing because it shows there is a big difference between planning to be shot and actually being shot the look his face says it all his arm hurt he is probably hoping or glad that the bullet did not break a bone but at the same time a little relieved that he achieved what he set out to do it is all right there for me he looks relatively calm and collected for just having been shot
1424208 the deeper question is who took the photo was it a spectator or was it a photographer arranged by burden ahead of time
1424209 but just because something is artificial does not mean it is not useful and cant be used to convey a powerful message
1424210 i think a few people have misunderstood what i was trying to get at in the essay
1424211 warhols studio is dark artificially lit and had reflective ceilings not because i am interpreting that but because that is the message he wanted to send
1424212 the important thing is that there is an agenda behind every single one of these images

1424232 my article appeared in ad week a month after yours did
1424233 i heard you were the nebraska state ping pong champion
1424234 that wasnt the problem i just didnt like the way he handled the interview
1424235 i spent over an hour with him telling him everything about the company and introducing him to all the key people
1424236 i even gave him an extensive tour of the manufacturing area
1424237 and then i brought him back to my office and we sat down to talk about what hed seen i asked him if he had any questions
1424238 ask not what your company can do for you ask what you can do for your company
1424239 no not really i know you dont know the answer to what were looking for
1424240 it was my turn to question you but i think ill just keep an eye on you youve got the look of someone whod kill me if you had the chance
1424241 well you three did kind of ruin my ruined night
1424242 hopefully it doesnt get ruined any further we just want what we think phil and bob must have or know about
1424243 has it ever occurred to you three that maybe they have no idea where whatever youre looking for is
1424244 it has occurred to me but i dont think mokoto buys it
1424245 you folks really dont mind telling us your names do you
1424246 well whats mokotos story she seems like shed rather be anywhere else right now
1424247 that was my understanding youre here to insure phil cooperates and if phil doesnt know he should insure bobs cooperation
1424248 you think keeping phil prisoner will help bob remember something
1424249 why if we have to well make phil scream for his life its easier to get someone to talk if their lack of cooperation translates to someone they hold close
1424250 so im here to make phil talk is that right
1424251 you might be the key to everything anything we do to you will break phil and likewise anything we do to phil will break bob youre the most expendable since you have no idea what were even looking for for your sake and for phils i hope bob remembers something i really do perhaps you have the wrong impression of me i dont particularly enjoy killing people

1424255 desert storm they expected the hornets nest could quickly spread to the entire middle east so they included the embassies all over that area of the world in their planning their goal was to sucker saddam hussein into invading kuwait to collect what the iraqi people were legitimately due
1424256 saddam is not like the saudi princes who spend the bulk of their lives outside of their country and who fritter away the kingdoms oil profits on prostitutes and bottles of champagne in paris no saddam is building railways creating electrical networks highways and other important elements of a serious state infrastructure after eights years of war against the iranian regime of khomeini he desperately needs to demobilize his republican guard which incorporates so many of this technical elite in order to rebuild his war devastated country these people are his technicians his engineers if they are put to work in the way saddam wishes they will rapidly make iraq the most advanced power in the region and we cannot allow this to happen
1424257 now we can see a new world coming into view a world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order
1424258 are these medical need cases from the military bases bush has put in the caspian basin area or combat related injuries
1424259 they are both need for general medical treatment and combat related vehicle accidents non combat injuries major illness combat injuries etc
1424260 interesting i do not seem to recall reading in the news that the us is involved in combat operations in those nations are we talking about black ops
1424261 yes it is almost all black ops in those nations
1424262 how did you know that these troops had been injured in those nations and not say in afghanistan
1424263 because they were angry at what they had been sent to do and they wanted someone to talk to about it as their care providers safe in the hospital late at night they cried they talked they confessed to us what they had been sent to do we are all under orders to shut up not tell the truth but soldier to soldier we talked a lot i heard more than i was prepared to hear due to the horrid extent of the injuries i saw more than i was prepared to see
1424264 why would a tough special ops soldier be crying loss of a fellow soldier loss of a leg or limb or god forbid his genitals or face unrecognizable anymore
1424265 because of what they were sent to do once they figured out what the real mission was
1424266 no they were sent to be the terrorists and it is why they were sent that had them crying some of them were afraid that god would never forgive them and i think they might be right at times there were some attacks on the us soldiers by people who do not want us there and some pay back attacks after us forces had attacked them but for the most part what i was being told about was the us conducting intimidation and terrorism operations against civilians to get their oil and gas
1424267 many of the people in those areas do not like america do not trust america many are competing to get control of areas of land that have or are thought to have vast amounts of oil or natural gas some of it is oil and gas leases some of it pipeline right of way to get it to a port and ship it all over the world
1424268 i know the caspian basin mother lode the idiotic grand chessboard that is why i have been reporting on and researching the caspian basin and the real reasons we attacked afghanistan to steal a pipeline deal from an argentina company have these soldiers been sent in to strong arm threaten terrorize etc with these big oil thugs and things got too hot shooting started
1424269 some times yes but that is not what had many of them upset unless they did lose a fellow soldier or yes they lost a future because of their injuries
1424270 exactly and that is exactly why i contacted you japan china russia and others are over there to sign up the oil and gas leases but the us is the only one i know of that is going in there and terrorizing or killing people to get its way they are using us soldiers to try to force people to sign a contract or kill them and take it from them anyway the truth has to get out about what bush has done and used 9 11 as the excuse to do it these black ops started way before 9 11 they had to get oil and gas leases signed then they had to get the pipeline under control
1424271 many of our soldiers have already figured out that 9 11 was just to get the pipeline they need across afghanistan many of these soldiers know they were used to get the oil and gas leases nailed down so there would be something to put through that pipeline
1424272 the us army or marines cannot tell you the truth lest they want to face court martial and spend the rest of their life in leavenworth as for me i am no longer concerned about making grade to colonel or general i am resigning my commission and getting out of this web of lies and evil i can no longer serve this nation and what it really stands for and what is does and will not tell america im finished
1424273 were you able to determine from any of these special ops soldiers how long such covert operations had been going on prior to 9 11
1424274 yes according to some of them these operations had been going on for up to a year before 9 11 and possibly even longer they had to nail down those oil and gas leases pipeline right of ways because many other nations were after the same oil and gas deals
1424275 the thought just occurred to me how do they explain these injuries or kia of these soldiers who are waging black ops against civilians in nations we supposedly have no ongoing military operations afghanistan
1424276 afghanistan some times if after october 7 2001 or they list them as victims of terrorists without explaining that they were killed or injured conducting acts of terrorism against civilians and a fire fight broke out innocent humans except they were sitting on land with oil and gas under it there were some attacks on us troops as pay back
1424277 did any of these soldiers admit to you how they figured out that someone had ordered them on an illegal mission an illegal order to go process a death warrant on civilians who would not sign a contract

1424306 were too talented of a team to take tough shots because theres always going to be someone open
1424307 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ball game
1424308 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
1424309 we just broke down we gambled a couple of times and allowed them to make the extra pass

1424528 seemingly gender neutral workplace norms can result in discriminatory outcomes and perpetuate gender inequality
1424529 many workplaces use face time as an important proxy signal for workers commitment or professional competence
1424530 however it should be noted that increased work hours do not assure increased productivity and more importantly it can seriously disadvantage many female workers who put in fewer hours at work than men

1424541 the intellectual skills of 15 to 30 month olds as measured by the bayley mental scale at 16 and 22 months and the mcdi at 30 months were significantly related to the fathers engagement in unstructured play fathers positive rating of children the amount fathers and children interacted and fathers aspirations for childrens independence as measured on an age expected questionnaire
1424542 its hard to tell parents how to interact with their children based on one study but what we see here is that parents who have a propensity for being verbally aggressive have a tendency to try to direct and control their children during a play period
1424543 as a result these children were less cooperative and not only are parents setting up situations that are challenging for them to handle but they also are subtly undermining their childs self esteem
1424544 of course all parents direct their children and people in general are always directing others to close a door or hand them something
1424545 its something we do all the time but there is a qualitative difference in the kinds of directing going on by these verbally aggressive mothers by looking at how and when directives occurred not just how often we found that moms who scored highest on verbal aggression used directives to control the child and ultimately the way the game or activity was played the aggressive action is not overt as in a parent hitting or yelling but these small negative maneuvers can say so much to a child
1424546 we all say things to our children that we regret saying but saying a lot of things that attack a childs self confidence is not healthy
1424547 these parents were in an unstructured low stress environment and if we saw this behavior in such a brief setting how could such negative interactions even so subtle affect a child over the long term for example if the parents always have to control what activity they and their children are going to play as well as for how long and how they are going to play it you wonder if this communicates to the child that what they want to do doesnt matter

1424772 while many continue to say that he will play defensive end or tight end at the next level i see it differently this is a young man who has tremendous athletic ability a good throwing arm and tremendous size i have to say that watching daunte culpepper in high school this is what he looked like

1424789 since we have come back theres more drivers off the tee its enclosed with more bunkers i suppose most of them were there the last time but i think that you got to hit driver youve got to hit it straight and the greens while theyre incredibly difficult to putt on theyre at least a little bit more receptive than they were back in the ryder cup
1424790 the usual setup for the pga is more like a tough pga tour event
1424791 this year the last couple years its gotten more like a traditional u s open type test its nearly more u s open type than the u s open is at the moment if that makes any sense its actually like they switched the two of them around this year
1424792 the last two set ups for the u s open i dont think theres a player that wouldnt want to play golf courses like that every week
1424793 brilliantly set up very fair different grades of rough as you get away from the fairway
1424794 i think this golf course is set up more like what a u s open was set up three or four years ago where missing the fairway by a couple of yards is the same as missing it by 10 yards as in there is no difference once you go off theres no first cut second cut third cut of rough
1424795 this is a tougher test in terms that its a more intimidating test and more punishing in that sense that a slight miss is just as bad as a big miss
1424796 maybe even a big miss might get away with more
1424797 we continue to execute well and expect to gain share during these tougher operating environments

1424816 the content industry in suing cablevision once again overreached in its goal to limit the personal uses of increasingly popular technology
1424817 we hope this case will be another signal to hollywood to scale back its attacks on consumer friendly technologies
1424818 cablevision has no control over what programs are made available on individual channels or when those programs will air if at all
1424819 in this respect cablevision possesses far less control over recordable content than it does in the vod context where it actively selects and makes available beforehand the individual programs available for viewing
1424820 the cable companies have done just about all they can to damage tivo by keeping them outside the fraternity
1424821 people who are buying tivo are doing it despite all the obstacles the cable tv companies are putting in front of them and i dont think this will much change that

1424832 the white house had concocted a fake letter from director of iraqi intelligence habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1424833 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1424834 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd

1424854 a secret deal between britain and the notorious al mahdi militia prevented british forces from coming to the aid of their us and iraqi allies for nearly a week during the battle for basra this year
1424855 us officials knew of the discussions which continued until march this year
1424856 a spokesman for the mod said that the reason why troops were not sent immediately into basra was because there was
1424857 colonel imad who heads the 2nd battalion 1st brigade 1st iraqi army division the most experienced division commanded one of the quick reaction battalions summoned to assist british trained local forces who faltered from the outset because of inexperience and lack of support he said
1424858 lieutenant colonel chuck western a senior us marine advising the iraqi army
1424859 captain eric whyne another us marine officer who took part in the battle said that he was astounded that
1424860 a senior british defence source agreed that the battle for basra had been damaging to britains reputation in iraq
1424861 maliki and the americans felt the british were morally impugned by the deal they had reached with the militia the british were accused of trying to find the line of least resistance in dealing with the shia militia
1424862 you can accuse the americans of many things such as hamfistedness but you cant accuse them of not addressing a situation when it arises while we had a strategy of evasion the americans just went in and addressed the problem

1424868 driving in here it was nice to see where everything was and bring back a few memories
1424869 ive been out on the golf course and although it has changed a little bit basically its the same im looking forward to the week
1424870 i played pretty good that week in 2004 and obviously im playing all right at the moment i hope to carry that form through
1424871 im carrying a lot of confidence through from last week and its always good to come back somewhere where youve played well in the past and you have good memories from
1424872 i have very happy memories around this golf course and im very much looking forward to getting out there
1424873 its a golf course i got to know in one of the most memorable weeks ive ever had it will be nice to refresh my mind with those good thoughts
1424874 its amazing especially when you consider the strength of european golf over the last few years
1424875 i think over the last 15 years theres been a little bit of a lull in european golf in terms of winning majors so thats why there hasnt been such great form in the pga
1424876 but obviously there are plenty of good european players around now and there are plenty of them capable of winning
1424877 im not as stressed i obviously know im good enough to win
1424878 but this one at birkdale was a lot more satisfying

1424881 in the next week or so i will have to make one of the biggest decisions of my career
1424882 i am nearing the crossroads where if the injury does not improve i will have to decide whether or not to go ahead with surgery
1424883 the alternative is simply to give my wrist more time to heal and continue with the rehabilitation therapy which i have been doing over the past few weeks
1424884 it is a huge decision because if i go for surgery next week then i certainly would be out for at least two to three months which would take me through to october in effect i would miss the rest of the season
1424885 at this point it doesnt look good for me for the ryder cup
1424886 if i go for surgery then obviously im out but if i choose to continue with the rest and rehabilitation then i might miss the next three or four events and that would probably mean i would not automatically qualify for the team nick faldo to offer me a wildcard place
1424887 it has all been hugely frustrating and missing the british open and the u s pga and possibly missing the ryder cup are all very disappointing
1424888 driving in here it was nice to see where everything was and bring back a few memories
1424889 ive been out on the golf course and although it has changed a little bit basically its the same im looking forward to the week

1424897 en la actualidad la mayor a de la poblaci n tiene m s a os de escolaridad que la generaci n de sus padres pero eso no es suficiente garant a para lograr empleo por inadecuaci n de los objetivos y logros con relaci n a la situaci n laboral
1424898 se produce una relaci n de ida y vuelta entre el mercado de trabajo y el sistema educativo ya que si por un lado la escolarizaci n no habilita para lograr empleo la falta del mismo trae aparejada la expulsi n y a n imposibilidad de ingreso a la educaci n formal sistem tica
1424899 la diferencia entre educaci n p blica y privada se va ahondando y la primera cada vez m s ineficiente queda reservada para los sectores de menores ingresos reproduciendo la situaci n social en vez de trasformarse en palanca de cambio
1424900 en definitiva la falta de presupuesto educativo suficiente la falta de actualizaci n de la totalidad del personal docente la preponderancia de saberes tradicionales la falta de modificaci n adecuada de los planes de estudio la ausencia de estudios de prospectiva laboral para adecuar las terminalidades de los diferentes niveles de la educaci n sistem tica sobre todo en el caso de la escuela p blica atenta seriamente a las posibilidades laborales

1424962 even though i am younger i know hopkins is a slick veteran with a bunch of boxing tricks in his bag i refuse to underestimate him and i know on october 18 he will be ready to fight i am treating this as if it were a championship match with my plan being to remain undefeated and show the world that i am able to take on any fighter regardless of age weight or record
1424963 kelly pavlik has a heart of a lion but he has no idea what he is in for on october 18
1424964 pavlik might be the latest thing on a fast track to fame but i am a sure thing and will take this kid to school that night and teach him a lesson he will never forget
1424965 there is no doubt that bernard hopkins is a great fighter and was virtually unstoppable in his prime but kelly pavlik is recognizably one of the best fighters in boxing today and he will continue to prove his himself against a legendary fighter like bernard this is a tremendous challenge for kelly on october 18
1424966 the match up between kelly pavlik and bernard hopkins will be one for the record books
1424967 hopkins has the experience and pavlik has the desire to prove himself i am looking forward to seeing pavlik defend his undefeated record but i know bernard can rise to the occasion and take down one of boxings brightest stars
1424968 kelly pavlik atlantic citys most recent boxing hero and world champion takes on the cagey veteran bernard hopkins from philadelphia in his own back yard caesars atlantic city is proud to continue its tradition of bringing world class events to atlantic city

1425016 minimal progress has been made in adopting a more customer oriented crm based approach within the contact centre environment over the last 10 years when we compared this years findings with those from our inaugural 1997 report the picture is not positive
1425017 these findings indicate that the development of a more holistic and sophisticated approach to customer management is less of a priority than it was 10 years ago and there is a back to basics trend with contact centres focusing more on basic performance efficiencies and cost reduction
1425018 this is also reflected in the commercial drivers of contact centres only 16 of participating centres ranked creating direct customer relationships among their top three commercial drivers compared with over 50 10 years ago this underscores that there has been a major shift away from the tenets of crm over the last decade
1425019 this years survey confirms that when the basic service components are firmly in place customer service experience improves and client retention accelerates when we compared these service components to the level of priority or attention organisations place on them the results were enlightening
1425020 the choice of medium or channel was ranked among the lowest methods for customer service improvement less than 2 of participants selected this option in their top three choices for impact on customer satisfaction
1425021 taking into account that call resolution is the greatest indicator of customer service improvement we were surprised to learn that not all contact centres have aligned themselves to its measurement and targeting
1425022 contact centres still rely on the standard efficiency metrics abandon rate is the most commonly used target with 90 1 of participating centres using it as a key metric while only 63 4 of centres use first call resolution as a performance target these findings indicate a discrepancy between what customers want and what contact centres focus their costs and energy on
1425023 compared to last years benchmarking report these figures highlight the ongoing trend by organisations to reduce investment in training even though agent communication and service skills enhance customer satisfaction and the service experience
1425024 youtring is much more than just another social networking community there are currently no other web ventures offering the kind of services we are launching

1425029 this is a tremendous achievement for a south african based company and we acknowledge our fellow local nominees who are also making an impact in this growing and competitive industry
1425030 promoting the interests and advancement of comparatively new industries such as the contact centre and business process outsourcing industries is difficult when researchers and innovators work independently or more often highly competitively a well run and well organised recognition process such as the contact center world awards adds untold value to the industry generally and assists greatly with our local growth

1425034 we think were probably only using 30 or 40 percent of the power of the ps3 right now and theres this great untapped potential
1425035 all third party developers can get the edge libraries for free and are going to be able to use them in their own ways to get more and more and more out of the ps3 over the years
1425036 theres a set of tools called edge that were developed on the naughty dog premises actually by a group of very very senior games programmer some from naughty dog and some from elsewhere
1425037 i think its tremendously visionary of sony to make these tools which are largely low level libraries

1425041 you are going to see a huge surge in short sale completions for homeowners who fail to qualify to keep their home

1425043 this new fha hotline will provide peace of mind for all those mortgage companies trying to increase their origination volume using the fha program
1425044 where borrowers with loan balances higher than their original loan amount are located in neighborhoods that are still appreciating they have the loan to value ratios needed to refinance
1425045 certainly this is a small group however this is the level of micro targeting that lenders need to be engaged in while under these market conditions
1425046 mortgage power network is like having an instruction manual for virtually every facet of the mortgage industry from specific software technologies to specific marketing campaigns

1425057 two years ago i first began to think about the rollover
1425058 i can appreciate that this is a small island and the caymanians dont want to be dominated by expats but people like me are not asking to vote were not asking to run the country only to make a home here
1425059 but now because of the rollover instead of investing my hard earned savings here this island that is kicking me out i now have no choice but to take it back with me to canada
1425060 basically i lost all of my stuff the water was over the roof of my car and almost all my household things were destroyed
1425061 whereas i stayed here and helped rebuild the country helped the caymanians clean things up to bring the country back but i feel like i was punished for having stayed
1425062 the government says you can go away and come back in a year and try to return but how can a person put their entire life on hold for a year based on the fact that they might let you return and that if they did you might be able to find another job here
1425063 ive been dealing with this for a while now and im ready to move on ive put seven years of my life here and i really enjoyed living here and i think ive been contributing
1425064 a lot of people ask me if i would come back to cayman id have to think about it long and hard i mean do you really want to consider making a home in a place that really doesnt actually seem to want you

1425081 the increase in the number of babies and the relative decrease in the size of the personnel are behind the deaths we believe
1425082 this hospital has more personnel than most others but its still not enough
1425083 its hard to get my husband to do things like this so we just sat at a table and answered all the questions on one large numbered sheet of paper
1425084 keith joked through the whole quiz he moved the paper covering my answers and i caught him we both were hysterical but especially me
1425085 ive known my husband for twenty years and yes a few questions really made me think
1425086 doing this quiz reminded me about one of our favorite restaurants
1425087 we knew each other better than we know ourselves for my favorite leisure activity i wrote down golf and he wrote down reading the sunday paper on the deck by myself actually that is my favorite activity even over a round of golf i knew his favorite dessert is pecan pie he didnt think of it at first and then he remembered that is his ultimate

1425090 in the complex and fast paced world of medicine where patient safety is a primary concern physicians need to be assured that they are using agents and the best possible safety profile this is particularly important with agents that affect heart rhythm and may predispose patients to life threatening arrhythmias that can occur without warning
1425091 many urologists and other physicians who treat bph dont often have access to ecg to monitor the cardiac safety of the agents they prescribe
1425092 therefore its important that physicians recognize which agents affect the qtc interval and to avoid those agents if an alternative is available

1425098 our exhibition hall will be crowded with manufacturers introducing new technology

1425112 firstly the patent of valcyte which is in question in this matter was granted by the chennai patent office the other reason is obviously its bad experience in the delhi high court as far as the tarceva patent infringement was concerned
1425113 we know that litigations are costly but our intention here is to address the need of indian patients and public interest is what matters in such cases so we are not worried
1425114 since the patent for valganciclovir is not very strong as it already has been opposed by multiple parties and because a drug prescribed for hiv aids infections has larger social implications cipla may have a strong argument for a generic copy

1425134 although darwin gave us an essential component for the evolution of complexity it is not a sufficient theory
1425135 evolution on its own doesnt look like it can make the creative leaps that have occurred in the history of life
1425136 its a great process for refining tinkering and so on but self organisation is the process that is needed alongside natural selection before you get the kind of creative power that we see around us
1425137 understanding how those two processes combine is the biggest challenge in biology
1425138 this is a real chance for bollywood to play a major role in shaping the nigerian industry
1425139 nigeria has realized that as far as the quality of films and professional knowledge goes they need to improve on that
1425140 this presents a huge opportunity for the indian industry to create distribution networks for the nigerian industry
1425141 it could also mean collaboration on film projects between the two industries
1425142 this venture is important because of the positive impact it would have on nollywood and nigeria
1425143 in any case we struggle to fill up the existing vacancies with almost half of the vacancies for teachers going to reserved categories it might just get more difficult

1425146 the merit argument put forth by anti quota activists is a standard upper caste argument
1425147 at jnu we all support the quotas that are very important for social inclusion of backward castes and communities
1425148 each time we say anything against the quotas we are termed non inclusive in our approach but if we de reserve seats that otherwise belonged to the reserved category we would be at the receiving end of overwhelming flak no matter how earnest our efforts may be in filling up the quota seats
1425149 we therefore want the government to protect us against this prospect too while giving us absolute freedom to de reserve the seats and fill them up with general candidates

1425254 sharing of information is getting more and more important all the time for organizations as they try to achieve greater levels of productivity agility and simply make their organizations more effective
1425255 theyve got these silos of information across the business people dont really understand where information resides what it looks like what it means or the semantics around it and as such they find it difficult to share in effect they are talking different languages
1425256 basically the amount of data is growing not only in volume but the number of different sources it is coming from

1425277 the 1 5326 1 6376 rally is in 5 waves therefore expectations are for a similar 5 wave rally to succeed the corrective decline from 1 6376 therefore it is possible that a low is in place a bullish bias is warranted
1425278 one possibility is that a triangle is complete from the august 1992 top and that the next move is a bullish break from the triangle if this is correct then the euraud is forming a major low now 1 5922 would be critical to this long term bullish bias
1425279 those standards are fairly tough to meet but in many respects the beijing area does so
1425280 im sure im confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in beijing
1425281 you got to take every chance you have just to protect the airways
1425282 its really just taking every precaution necessary who knows how bad its going to be in a few days so if you can resist any air pollution any contaminants then you know its better performance hopefully
1425283 i am certain that it was in no way intended to be disrespectful
1425284 it is an athletes choice however it didnt seem to be necessary today
1425285 we will evaluate those and should problems arise we may have to take some action
1425286 exaggeration of the problem that has been seen in the media
1425287 to come to a city even though the air quality might be inferior the long term effects should no longer be feared by temporary visitors
1425288 the mist in the air that we see in those places including here is not a feature of pollution primarily but a feature of evaporation and humidity
1425289 we do have a communication problem here once the misconception has become sort of established in the minds of people its not that easy to get the right message through

1425292 piata de inghetata se va dezvolta continuu nu in ritmul de pana acum si consider ca va avea loc in viitorul apropiat o concentrare a jucatorilor de pe piata inghetatei urmand o perioada de fuziuni achizitii si concentrare a jucatorilor pe aceasta piata in urmatorii cinci ani va fi o crestere continua a pietei de inghetata atat din punct de vedere al volumului cat si din punct de vedere al diversificarii ofertei producatorilor dar nu in ritmul de crestere din ultimii cinci ani
1425293 dupa parerea mea piata de inghetata din romania este foarte competitiva si extrem de fragmentata probabil se va mai stabiliza in urmatorii ani oricum are un potential de crestere foarte mare
1425294 este o piata in care oferta este generoasa piata nu a ajuns la maturitate exista inca multe firme care nu si au gasit identitatea si care produc orice oricat de ieftin doar pentru a exista pe piata foarte multi producatori se suprapun cu oferte similare in zona pret mic calitate scazuta oferta pentru gama premium este mult restransa in comparatie cu celelalte game dar este diversificata in acelasi timp ca format ambalaj cantitate si sortiment oferta este la nivelul statelor dezvoltate

1425298 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1425299 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1425300 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1425301 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1425302 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1425303 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1425304 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1425305 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

1425324 the issue of screening for prostate cancer is frankly an area of medicine that remains somewhat unsettled
1425325 while its clear there is benefit to a significant number of men its equally clear that many men end up being diagnosed and treated for cancers that would likely not have caused them any significant harm
1425326 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1425327 thats because every 75 year old is not created equal
1425328 very active very vigorous and have minimal health issues and many of those men are going to live into their late 80s or 90s
1425329 ad sales is a very different business than content production
1425330 it was fun to play and its extremely supportive but distracting to the primary mission of rocketboom and our teams talents
1425331 every moment we spent on ads was a moment lost on the content we wanted to interface with ads in some way but why not leave this job up to people who have a passion for it
1425332 risking everything to make this the best distribution and advertising deal ever
1425333 instead of gaining capital to burn while continuing to build or seek an advertising solution we now have one of the most prominent advertising solutions out there
1425334 along with increased distribution a road map for expansion and a guarantee that i believe is an unprecedented deal for this space
1425335 thrilled to have it in our portfolio and to take it to the next level
1425336 the coldest winter i ever had was the summer i spent in san francisco
1425337 to whom it may concern i guess if youre reading this that means you
1425338 whats helped me is having really good friends i know i can rely on
1425339 cameron diaz is one of the greatest friend anyone can ever have she has so much love to give we also support each other through the bad times ive always felt like shes my big sister but at the same time i know that sometimes im wiser and a bit less naive than she is we just spend so much time having fun and laughing together thats what true friendship is about from star magazine print edition august 11 2008 star also has some more quotes from drew about her difficult childhood growing up with a mother who let her do whatever she wanted and a father who was losing his faculties from the way they work them into the article they seem like theyre from an old interview and i was able to find the original full quote but its unsourced ive never really understood how i should feel or behave in a relationship i didnt have the kind of childhood or family life that would have given me any perspective on what a happy home life or relationship would feel like my father was literally out of his mind and my mother was more like a friend than a real mom to me she would take me out to clubs and i wound up feeling like part of this very unreal kind of world although that was the only world i ever knew growing up
1425340 its mature but i feel like it speaks to kids and it doesnt white wash anything
1425341 he has a fine legal background and comes with the highest recommendation from david barber
1425342 im confident he will be an outstanding district attorney for the people of jefferson county
1425343 it is a great honor to be appointed by governor riley as district attorney for jefferson county
1425344 david barber has been an inspiration to me and i hope to continue the fine tradition that he has set in leading this office
1425345 i think if and when we do wed probably announce it after the fact as opposed to making any big announcement
1425346 we both wear rings and im giddy when i see all the pictures of people so happy standing there confirming the love they wish they could have expressed for a long time
1425347 im a big proponent of monogamous relationships regardless of sexuality and im proud of how the nation is steering toward that
1425348 was tricky part of the coming out process is figuring out who you like and what that means and how to act on it
1425349 being an actor reduced my level of anonymity i couldnt just go to some bar and walk in and ask someone out on a date
1425350 if i had any regret it would be that strange lack of anonymity that created panic within myself that i would be found out
1425351 number one i believe in vaccinating our daughters and health i know theres a lot of controversy around vaccinations i dont believe in all of them i believe they need some of them
1425352 dr waldstein should spend more time treating his patients than leaking stories to tmz

1425362 happily never after how hollywood favors adultery and promiscuity over marital intimacy on prime time broadcast television
1425363 suggest that many in hollywood are actively seeking to undermine marriage by consistently showing it in a negative manner
1425364 even more troubling than the marginalization of marriage and glorification of non marital sex on television is tvs recent obsession with outr sexual expression

1425369 israel displayed an excellent ear and fine false turn of phrase during the 15 or so months in the early 1990s when she sold hundreds of phony celebrity letters and a lot of filched real ones to about 30 different dealers now all these years later shes written a slender sordid and pretty damned fabulous book about her misadventures if i were a librarian i wouldnt let lee israel through the door but id certainly make sure i had her latest book on the shelves if i were an editor id sign her up to write a biography of louise brooks and not just to keep her out of trouble
1425370 the effect of this book on me was to make me like ammon shea and briefly to hate english what a choking god awful mash it is surely french is better then i recovered and saw its greatness afresh the o e d shea notes is a catalog of the foibles of the human condition shea has walked the wildwood of our gnarled ancient speech and returned singing incomprehensible sounds in a language that turns out to be our own
1425371 doris lessing once declared that fiction makes a better job of the truth than straightforward reminiscence and while that might well be true of her celebrated and semi autobiographical martha quest novels its an observation that doesnt apply at all to her latest book alfred amp emily an intriguing work that is half fiction half memoir the sketchy insubstantial first half of the book imagines what her parents lives might have been like if world war i had never occurred the potent and harrowing second half recounts the real life story of her parents and the incalculable ways in which the war fractured their dreams and psyches and left them stranded in the bush in africa eking out a meager existence on a tiny farm in rhodesia
1425372 brenda wineapple brings a scholars diligence and a novelists imagination to her account of dickinson and higginsons relationship crafting a tour de force that should delight specialists and casual readers alike the books individual strands of inquiry higginsons life dickinsons poems the letters that passed between them and the historical political and artistic contexts of the age are interesting in and of themselves but when intertwined so as to inform and strengthen each other theyre fascinating
1425373 a good and happy child is so well done that part of me wishes i had missed it i like to sleep soundly at night
1425374 this sly and discombobulating flight of whimsy by david deans is in a sense a book length joke and nothing drains the humor from a good joke as effectively as vivisecting it has comenius hallucinated his transformation and if so where did he acquire his knowledge of kafka and rilke of orpheus and lady macbeth is bob a good guy after all is he even out of town let alone in mexico and where is miss scarlett anyway mr deans may or may not provide the answers to these queries but the readers irresistible desire to know is evidence that hes pulled off a splendid joke
1425375 despite its specific american flavors travel writing seems most like a contemporary french novel such as those by christian oster and gregoire bouillier a book in which an atmosphere of established and almost enviable dailiness underwrites sophisticated narrative conceits truth matters less than the telling and that makes for a cool easy kind of fiction its not hemingway or borges or even dashiell hammett but its nice
1425376 have i raved enough i feel as if im barrys publicist or agent maybe shell give me a cut of the 2 million but i did love this book it didnt matter if i was in a bad mood or tired or had other things to do i wanted to read this book i wanted to be living in these characters minds hanging out in salem or on yellow dog island does the novel deserve the hype i certainly dont begrudge it
1425377 the now forgotten us immigrants to the soviet union in the early thirties were communist sympathisers or more often desperate victims of the depression at first they were feted waves of repression however ensured that they and their descendants ended up either in russias prisons or as inmates of the gulag this is a powerful important and highly readable book the gulag is no novelty but tzouliadis brilliantly links high politics to the torment of innocents adding devastating detail
1425378 the process of government can be annoying in its obsessive repetition of its main theme in its lack of interest in empirical evidence and yet its one of those rare books which change the way you look at the world
1425379 it would be difficult to find any precedent in american history for the scale brutality and illegality of the torture and degradation inflicted on detainees over the last six years
1425380 it would be even harder to imagine a set of policies more likely to increase the dangers facing the united states and the world

1425412 two detectives were assigned full time to the johnia berry case
1425413 they had no other duties for three years except to solve this case i told joan berry it would be solved and it was as i sympathize with the berry family over the loss of their daughter this is just another desperate attempt by tyree to gain free media time
1425414 we are proud of our rate of solving homicides which is over 90 percent compared to the national average of about 54 percent on aug 8 tyree will realize that he ran against jimmy jones and not tim hutchison
1425415 i told joan berry it would be solved and it was

1425417 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1425418 inflation has been high spurred by earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated
1425419 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1425420 if there is a subtle shift in the risk assessment it is that while acknowledging the downside risks to growth it notes the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern

1425427 among the humble brick and vinyl suburban style houses along hyde park avenue in roslindale the hyde blakemore condominiums stand out there are the mahogany louvered fences the solar panels and the flying v roof line on the main building which besides looking cool channels rainwater into a landscaped rock garden such modern flourishes are rare in a city that cleaves to architectural convention but they are especially striking considering that hyde blakemore was built for lower income families the newly completed buildings defy the tacky stereotype of government subsidized housing and for the architects and developers behind a new crop of affordable projects this is the whole idea

1425429 t ransportation costs are not the only reasons why globalization as we know it might be in for some rapid evolution consider
1425430 some of the economic advantages of globalization have come from companies gaining the ability to skirt labor and environmental laws by doing business in countries with high levels of political corruption corruption they have often helped create
1425431 one of the most enduring urban myths suggests that most jobs are in the core of metropolitan areas making commuting from the far suburbs more difficult thus as fuel prices have increased many have expected that people will begin moving from farther out in the suburbs to locations closer to the cores indeed in some countries such as australia much of the urban planning regime of the last decade has been based upon the assumption that urban areas must not be constrained because the residents on the fringe wont be able to get to work like many myths this one has limited conformity with the truth this can be seen even in new york the new york metropolitan area the combined statistical area which is home to the second largest central business district in the country and by far the most well developed transit system in north america yet despite this a close examination of work trip data from the 2006 u s census american community survey shows a pattern of shorter work travel times for many of the most far flung areas while those located closer to the core often experience longer commutes

1425439 our current approaches may be a case of too little too late
1425440 data are now available to show that instituting a low saturated fat low cholesterol diet in infancy seven months is perfectly safe without adverse effects on growth development and sexual maturation
1425441 the nih has already committed itself to wars on obesity and diabetes mellitus
1425442 the weapons for those wars education and behavior modification are the same as those needed for a war on coronary heart disease
1425443 the implication is that if blood cholesterol levels are sufficiently low the other dominant risk factors constitute much less of a threat
1425444 it would be unreasonable to expect that all that damage could be reversed in just five years
1425445 thus the risk factors that predict the extent of fatty streaks in the young including hypercholesterolemia are the same as those that predict coronary heart disease risk and myocardial infarction in adults
1425446 we are dealing with a single disease entity that evolves slowly over decades
1425447 the implication is that having a low ldl from birth almost triples the magnitude of the effect on risk compared with the risk reduction found in a five year trial of middle age people

1425449 on becoming stars each member of the trio once referred to as two cocksuckers and elaine had unwittingly pulled some plugs from the main currents of ordinary life that had charged their improvisations with humanity they had been almost instantly isolated from the ensemble work of their peers the extraordinary improvisational foot soldiers thus their passage into celebrity did not return to the political comedy of the improvisational theater any insights into the issues of status and money or hard looks into the workings of power in the arts and society or revelations about the entertainment industry without the focus and urgency of the improvisational theater they were atomized from their most integrated and revealing work substituting for commonality and spontaneity the narcissism and obsessions of show business they grew silent in the society they once had satirized

1425454 was to have domesticated alienation and the difficulty of communication by making what benjamin is alienated from a middle class comic strip and making it absurdly evident that he has nothing to communicate which is just what makes him an acceptable hero for the large movie audience if he said anything or had any ideas the audience would probably hate him mike nicholss gift is that he lets the audience direct him this is demagoguery in the arts

1425481 there are different characters in each piece but it all feels like a connected event
1425482 there are certainly different scenes on the record and thats what i like and i think that takes real talent as a writer to fictionalize a reality the way inara has done
1425483 there was more love going through the glass with inara and van dyke than any other record ive worked on

1425493 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1425494 while there is little question that testing some men in this age group is probably not beneficial due to limited longevity and the potential adverse side effects of treatment a significant percentage of men at age 75 can be expected to live considerably longer than 10 years
1425495 the updated task force recommendations for men ages 50 to 74 are in line with the current recommendations from the american cancer society and other major medical groups our guidelines say men 50 and over with at least a 10 year life expectancy should be offered screening but the choice should be made by patients with their doctors this means men should be given the option to be tested and can make a decision after weighing the pros and cons

1425679 they showed me some footage but i dont have a feel for the movie i didnt see enough i wasnt sure who the terminator was i dont know if there is one or if hes the star or the hero these are the things that determine the success and how strong the movie will be

1425864 i really cant recommend that parents get accounts for the sole purpose of monitoring their children i think whats more important is parents need to engage their kids in dialogue about what is and what isnt appropriate to be posted online

1425877 ibms hpc open source stack results from long experience with keeping large scale computing systems running like clockwork
1425878 as more and more computing tasks migrate to supercomputer style clusters there is a need for software that can effectively utilize and manage the large number of processors found in these systems
1425879 managing thousands of processor cores and multiple types of processors is a challenge we see every day and it will only grow in the future

1425906 science when it has once acquired a firm hold upon social organization is hardly likely to stop short at those biological aspects of human life which have hitherto been left to the joint guidance of religion and instinct we may i think assume that both the quantity and the quality of the population will be carefully regulated by the state but that sexual intercourse apart from children will be regarded as a private matter so long as it is not allowed to interfere with work as regards quantity the state statisticians will determine as carefully as they can whether the population of the world at the moment is above or below the number which leads to the greatest material comfort per head they will also take account of all such changes of technique as can be foreseen no doubt the usual rule will be to aim at a stationary population but if some important invention such as artificial food should greatly cheapen the production of necessaries an increase of population might for a time be thought wise i shall however assume that in normal times the world government will decree a stationary population if we were right in supposing that the scientific society will have different social grades according to the kind of work to be performed we may assume also that it will have uses for human beings who are not of the highest grade of intelligence it is probable that there will be certain kinds of labour mainly performed by negroes and that manual workers in general will be bred for patience and muscle rather than for brains the governors and experts on the contrary will be bred chiefly for their intellectual powers and their strength of character assuming that both kinds of breeding are scientifically carried out there will come to be an increasing divergence between the two types making them in the end almost different species scientific breeding in any truly scientific form would at present encounter insuperable obstacles both from religion and from sentiment to carry it out scientifically it would be necessary as among domestic animals to employ only a small percentage of males for purposes of breeding it may be thought that religion and sentiment will always succeed in opposing an immovable veto to such a system i wish i could think so but i believe that sentiment is quite extraordinarily plastic and that the individualistic religion to which we have been accustomed is likely to be increasingly replaced by a religion of devotion to the state among russian communists this has already happened in any case what is demanded is scarcely as difficult a control of natural impulses as is involved in the celibacy of the catholic priesthood wherever remarkable achievements are possible and are at the same time such as to satisfy mens moral idealism the love of power is capable of swallowing up the instinctive life of the affections especially if an outlet is permitted to purely physical sexual impulses traditional religion which has been violently dispossessed in russia will suffer a setback everywhere if the russian experiment proves successful in any case its outlook is difficult to reconcile with that of industrialism and scientific technique traditional religion was based upon a sense of mans impotence in the face of natural forces whereas scientific technique induces a sense of the impotence of natural forces in the face of mans intelligence combined with this sense of power a certain degree of austerity in regard to the softer pleasures is quite natural one sees it already in many of those who are creating the mechanistic society of the future in america this austerity has taken the form of protestant piety in russia of devotion to communism i think therefore that there is hardly any limit to the departures from traditional sentiment which science may introduce into the question of reproduction if the simultaneous regulation of quantity and quality is taken seriously in the future we may expect that in each generation some 25 per cent of women and some 5 per cent of men will be selected to be the parents of the next generation while the remainder of the population will be sterilized which will in no way interfere with their sexual pleasures but will merely render these pleasures destitute of social importance the women who are selected for breeding will have to have eight or nine children each but will not be expected to perform any other work except the suckling of the children for a suitable number of months no obstacles will be placed upon their relations with sterile men or upon the relations of sterile men and women with each other but reproduction will be regarded as a matter which concerns the state and will not be left to the free choice of the persons concerned perhaps it will be found that artificial impregnation is more certain and less embarrassing since it will obviate the need of any personal contact between the father and mother of the prospective child sentiments of personal affection may still be connected with intercourse not intended to be fruitful while impregnation will be regarded in an entirely different manner more in the light of a surgical operation so that it will be thought not ladylike to have it performed in the natural manner the qualities for which parents will be chosen will differ greatly according to the status which it is hoped the child will occupy in the governing class a considerable degree of intelligence will be demanded of parents perfect health will of course be indispensable so long as gestation is allowed to persist to its natural period mothers will also have to be selected by their capacity for easy delivery and will therefore have to be free from an unduly narrow pelvis it is probable however that as time goes on the period of gestation will be shortened and that later months of foetal development will take place in an incubator this would also free mothers from the need of suckling their children and would thus make maternity a not very onerous matter the care of infants intended to belong to the governing class would seldom be left to the mothers mothers would be selected by their eugenic qualities and these would not necessarily be the qualities required in a nurse on the other hand the early months of pregnancy might be more burdensome than at present since the foetus would be subjected to various kinds of scientific treatment intended to affect beneficially not only its own characteristics but those of its possible descendants fathers would of course have nothing to do with their own children there would be in general only one father to every five mothers and it is quite likely that he would never have even seen the mothers of his children the sentiment of paternity would thus disappear completely probably in time the same thing would happen though to a slightly less degree in regard to mothers if birth were prematurely induced and the child separated from its mother at birth maternal sentiment would have little chance to develop
1425907 among the workers it is probable that less elaborate care would be taken since it is easier to breed for muscle than to breed for brains and it is not unlikely that women would be allowed to bring up their own children in the old fashioned natural manner there would not be among the workers the same need as among the governors for fanatical devotion to the state and there would not be therefore on the part of the government the same jealousy of the private affections among the governors one must suppose all private sentiments would be viewed with suspicion a man and woman who showed any ardent devotion to each other would be regarded as they are at present regarded by moralists when they are not married there would be professional nurses in cr ches and professional teachers in nursery schools but they would be considered to be failing in their duty if they felt any special affection for special children children who showed any special affection for a particular adult would be separated form that adult ideas of this kind are already widespread they will be found suggested for example in dr john b watsons book on education the tendency of the scientific manipulator is to regard all private affections as unfortunate freudians have shown us that they are the sources of complexes administrators realize that they stand in the way of a whole hearted devotion to business the church sanctioned certain kinds of love while condemning others but the modern ascetic is more thoroughgoing and condemns all kinds of love equally as mere folly and waste of time
1425908 what should we expect of the mental make up of people in such a world the manual workers may i think be fairly happy one may assume that the rulers will be successful in making the manual workers foolish and frivolous work will not be too severe and there will be endless amusements of a trivial sort owing to sterilization love affairs need not have awkward consequences so long as they are not between a man and woman who are both of them unsterilized in this way a life of easygoing and frivolous pleasure may be provided for the manual workers combined of course with a superstitious reverence for the governors instilled in childhood and prolonged by the propaganda to which adults will be exposed the psychology of the governors will be a more difficult matter they will be expected to display an arduous and hard working devotion to the ideal of the scientific state and to sacrifice to this ideal all the softer sentiments such as love of wife and children friendships between fellow workers whether of the same or of different sexes will tend to become ardent and will not infrequently overstep the limits which the public moralists will have fixed in such a case the authorities will separate the friends unless in doing so they will interrupt some important research or administrative undertaking when for some such public reason friends are not separated they will be admonished by means of governmental microphones the censors will listen in to their conversations and if these should at any time become tinged with sentiment disciplinary measures will be adopted all the deeper feelings will be frustrated with the sole exception of devotion to science and the state the governors will of course have their amusements for leisure hours i do not see how art or literature could flourish in such a world nor do i think that the emotions from which they spring and to which they appeal would meet with governmental approval but athletics of a strenuous kind will be encouraged among the young of the governing class and dangerous sports will be considered valuable as a training in those habits of mind and body by which authority over the manual workers will be maintained love making among the sterilized will be subjected to no restrictions either of law or of public opinion but it will be casual and temporary involving none of the deeper feelings and no serious affection persons suffering from unendurable boredom will be encouraged to ascend mount everest or fly over the south pole but the need for such distractions will be regarded as a sign of mental or physical ill health in such a world though there may be pleasure there will be no joy the result will be a type displaying the usual characteristics of vigorous ascetics they will be harsh and unbending tending towards cruelty in their ideals and their readiness to consider that the infliction of pain is necessary for he public good i do not imagine that pain will be much inflicted as punishment for sin since no sin will be recognized except insubordination and failure to carry out the purposes of the state it is more probable that the sadistic impulses which the asceticism will generate will find their outlet in scientific experiment the advancement of knowledge will be held to justify much torture of individuals by surgeons biochemists and experimental psychologist as time goes on the amount of added knowledge required to justify a given amount of pain will diminish and the number of governors attracted to the kinds of research necessitating cruel experiments will increase just as the sun worship of the aztecs demanded the painful death of thousands of human beings annually so the new scientific religion will demand its holocausts of sacred victims gradually the world will grow more dark and more terrible strange perversions of instinct will first lurk in the dark corners and then gradually overwhelm the men in high places sadistic pleasures will not suffer the moral condemnation that will be meted out to the softer joys since like the persecutions of the inquisition they will be found in harmony with the prevailing asceticism in the end such a system must break down either in an orgy of bloodshed or in the rediscovery of joy such at least is the only ray of hope to lighten the darkness of these visions of cassandra but perhaps in permitting this ray of hope we have allowed ourselves to yield to a foolish optimism perhaps by means of injections and drugs and chemicals the population could be induced to bear whatever its scientific masters may decide to be for its good new forms of drunkenness involving no subsequent headache may be discovered and new forms of intoxication may be invented so delicious that for their sakes these are possibilities in a world governed by knowledge without love and power without delight the man drunk with power is destitute of wisdom and so long as he rules the world the world will be a place devoid of beauty and of joy
1425909 take again such a matter as housing in england individualism leads most families to prefer a small house of their own rather than an apartment in a large house the result is that the suburbs of london are spread out through mile after mile of dreariness to the immense detriment of the women and children each housewife cooks an abominable dinner at great expenditure of labour for an infuriated husband the children when they come home from school or while they are too young to go to school find themselves cooped up in small stuffy premises where either they are a nuisance to their parents or their parents are a nuisance to them in a more sensible community each family would occupy a part of an immense building with a courtyard in the middle there would be no individual cooking but only communal meals children as soon as they were no longer at the breast would spend their day in large airy halls under the care of women possessing the knowledge the training and the temperament required for making young children happy the wives who at present drudge all day doing wasteful work badly would be set free to earn their living outside the home the benefit of such a system to the mothers and still more to the children would be incalculable at the rachel macmillan nursery school it was found that about 90 per cent of the children had rickets when they first came and almost all were cured at the end of the first year in the school in the ordinary home the necessary modicum of light and air and good food cannot be provided whereas all these things can be provided quite cheaply if they are provided for many children at once the freedom to cause ones children to grow up stunted and crippled on the ground that one is too fond of them to part with them is a freedom which is certainly not in the public interest

1426059 our job is to try to get the game in
1426060 you do the best you can do at the time i understand players dont want to be out there i dont want to be out there
1426061 look im back there with all that equipment out there no matter what decision you make somebodys not going to be happy to me bell did an incredible job
1426062 a friend of mine gonzalez was killed by lightning this year any of us could have gotten hit and i wasnt going to play again so i sprinted off the field
1426063 everybody was at risk everybody its not like it was just a slippery field and the players had a chance to get hurt everybody was at risk what if that had hit the stands
1426064 there was no need to be out there when the lightning is that close
1426065 theres only two really options if youre out in something like that you either have never seen a lightning storm before or youre a complete idiot
1426066 so i dont want to accuse the people that were hanging out in the stands and stuff of being idiots but i guess theyve never seen lightning well think about it people get killed by lightning strikes all the time its not likely to happen but its a heck of a lot more likely if youre standing outside in a lightning storm its one of those things where the people when a tragedy ends up happening its because people dont have respect for it nobody thats ever been struck by lightning probably thought theyd be struck by lightning

1426068 im not trying to put in on cubs general manager jim hendry or anything like that but whoever is in charge of the cubs and their operations here if it was me when the tornado sirens went off the first time i would have immediately said were not playing this game
1426069 you got reports of severe weather you got to keep some perspective here
1426070 this is a baseball game and these games are important because teams are trying to make the playoffs and everybody understands that
1426071 you put umpires in a bad spot because everybodys like well its on them they got to make the call well i mean theyre getting all kinds of pressure so i dont blame them i think somebodys got to step up in a situation like that and say look yes we all want to win a world series here we all want to make the playoffs but there comes a point and time when youve got to just say stop i guess in our modern day of technology people say oh well the radar says this well im standing outside there and i can see the lightning hit the firehouse 100 yards behind the stadium so i dont need a radar to tell me that
1426072 franck and i have already been doing a lot of sailing in the trimaran and in the 40s
1426073 francks really handy in the multihulls so im sure hell pick it up real quickly so were just going to try and get into it as quick as we can and were hopefully come away with a good result either way were going to learn a lot
1426074 i think probably the strength of the team is multi tasking just because we have to race so many different classes with multihulls were going as hard as we can to understand them but this is something that on my team we havent really specialised in so this is just another opportunity to get better in the multihulls
1426075 its going to be a lot of fun just to be together as a group all living together and racing a lot of top guys that are out there
1426076 our main objective is just to do well in the week like all the events weve competed in whether it be the tp52 or rc44s its just to go there and be successful so this is no different obviously alinghi are there and yeah wed love to beat them
1426077 its been a long time since i raced in the solent and im really looking forward to coming back there and remembering all the idiosyncrasies of the area
1426078 it can be windy it can be light theres always some current it can be shifty or steady every days different we know that were going to have a difficult battle with a lot of great teams again and were really excited about the opportunity
1426079 funny enough ive never raced at cowes so itll be good to finally get there it should be quite a bit of fun the extreme 40s are pretty exciting and weve sailed them in quite a bit of breeze as well so weve enjoyed it and im sure cowes will provide some pretty interesting conditions
1426080 this event is a special one for us as we will be sailing on home territory so i hope that we can pull out some good races and stay on the podium
1426081 ive got a busy life working and with two small children so the extreme 40s fit particularly well and it is definitely the most fun ive ever had in sailing
1426082 ive sailed some cool boats but this is just great im absolutely hooked on cats compared to this the yngling is so dull and this is such a contrast we have a ball on board i have taken guests on all kinds of boats but nothing compares to the experience that they get on the extreme 40
1426083 but it was also a refreshing relief to go and do something completely different this was turn key sailing with none of the grief associated with campaigning boats in the olympics and i really enjoyed it
1426084 they are really tricky boats but i think they are tricky for everyone even the experienced multihull sailors
1426085 when the boat is down speed it behaves a bit like a keelboat
1426086 one of the interesting things is that on the extreme 40 what is going to happen to you next is in front of you
1426087 whereas with the yngling it all just happens and you cant do anything about it so that takes a bit of adjusting to just getting your eye in but then again a lot of the skills are the same youve got to work with your team youve got to play to your strengths i was certainly the most inexperienced on our boat which was good it made me hungry it made me enjoy it a bit more and i had a big smile on my face i just loved it
1426088 i always think its a bit like one of those computer games you know you just manage to escape one enormous crash and then there is something else coming to get you its just one after another and it never stops there are loads of near misses and maybes but thats what makes it great
1426089 normally you can see the waves but you couldnt see anything and you just had to react
1426090 last year it was a foregone conclusion that team basilica would win
1426091 they were certainly the best prepared of everyone but i think this year the bar will be raised and the sailing space we will see at the 2008 venues is getting smaller and smaller so its going to be different

1426121 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1426122 mike told me hey were a better team with you on it but wanted to know if i have a problem with an open competition
1426123 i dont have a problem with competing you know that but aaron should be the starter right now because hes been out here all this time this is more than about an open competition and i can do that absolutely but this is going to be mass confusion and thats not good for this team
1426124 ill practice my butt off if it comes to that and i think we all know what the end result will be but this probably isnt going to work
1426125 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it
1426126 so they can say they welcome me back but come on the way theyve treated me tells you the truth they dont want me back so lets move on i dont know where its headed well see

1426138 one could be led to believe that the bucs holding out garcia is a preventive measure in anticipation of a trade to green bay for brett favre in our opinion such a trade makes only the most sense seeing the bucs would get a qb that should finally quell jon grudens itch at that position while offering green bay a proven backup alternative if aaron rodgers goes down with an injury or continues to underperform as he did in the glorified scrimmage the other night
1426139 he knows how it is he knows and i know and thats good enough for me im not bringing that out it is what it is hes the head coach and im the player thats it

1426403 en atenas con mi mejor marca hubiese sido sexto y hoy no s si entro en las semifinales
1426404 para m no hay ninguna chance de conseguir una medalla no lo digo para quitarme presi n sino lo que demuestra la realidad con la marca que me clasific para los juegos que es de 49s 04 100 no ingreso entre los mejores 24 tiempos si se mantiene el nivel que se viene dando en los ltimos ocho meses ser muy dif cil clasificar siquiera a una semifinal
1426405 los tiempos de ahora realmente sorprenden hay nadadores que hace dos o tres a os estaban a la par m a y hoy est n nadando un segundo y medio m s fuerte en este nivel es muy dif cil mejorar d cimas sin embargo ellos bajaron un segundo y medio eso te hace sospechar mucho
1426406 es cierto que muchos atletas provienen de pa ses productores de la nataci n que viven innovando y de los cuales estamos muy lejos lo que ellos consiguen quiz s nosotros comenzamos a copiarlo a os despu s pero tampoco creo que haya cambiado tanto la metodolog a y que estemos tan relegados en el tiempo en atenas con mi mejor marca hubiese sido sexto y hoy no s si entro en las semifinales
1426407 participar de una final ol mpica siempre fue un sue o latente algo que quise alcanzar m s all de haber conseguido logros importantes en mi carrera ese fue siempre un anhelo la realidad indica que ser muy dif cil de conseguir en beijing pero si no se d realmente estar muy tranquilo porque s que hice todo lo posible tuvimos una gran preparaci n y trabajamos muy seriamente en los meses previos
1426408 trato de no pensar que es mi ltimo juego intento que eso no me distraiga ni me vuelva loco la ansiedad ya me jug en contra en atenas donde estuve permanentemente pensando en la competencia antes de tiempo y eso no me hizo nada bien la clave es disfrutar compartir momentos con los chicos del equipo y tambi n con los de los dem s disciplinas obviamente con toda la responsabilidad que implica estar aqu en el evento m ximo al que puede aspirar un deportista
1426409 despu s de atenas hab a perdido las ganas las motivaciones hasta fines de 2005 me cost bastante recuperar el nivel pero despu s me di cuenta que todav a pod a seguir nadando volv a sentir confianza y fundamentalmente me di cuenta que esto me hac a feliz eso es fundamental practicar algo que te de placer
1426410 elegimos esa fecha porque hay otros nadadores que tambi n se van a retirar entonces acordamos hacer una especie de retiro todos juntos
1426411 seguramente ser un cambio muy brusco porque dejar lo que hice toda mi vida quiero volver a c rdoba donde est n mi familia y mis amigos all empezar con nuevos proyectos seguramente vinculados al deporte y por supuesto no descarto a la nataci n despu s de tantos a os en esta disciplina compartiendo momentos con grandes entrenadores y nadadores quiz s me ayuden a trasladar esa experiencia o a darles consejos a otros deportistas tal vez tambi n sirvan para mejorar la pol tica deportiva

1426435 most of the kids had never heard of or read any shakespeare but four years ago some of the children read one of the plays and wanted to put on their own production of it our company grew out of that
1426436 on one level the plays are just poetry turned into a story that can be acted out kids respond really well to hearing poetry read we try to break down the action so everyone understands whats happening whos in charge who wants something and who doesnt we cast carefully and we try to encourage the kids to read outside of our rehearsals we look for a lot of interest and influence from the families to make that happen
1426437 once the production gets rolling and everyone knows what theyre supposed to be doing the kids really run the show in the beginning we didnt do much in the way of sets and lighting now were moving to more theatrical productions

1426514 we favor both funds for many of the same reasons both have experienced top flight management supported by robust credit research staffs
1426515 both bond funds have performed strongly over the long term and during recent market turbulence
1426516 pimco total return is the worlds biggest bond fund and second large mutual fund of any stripe with 128 billion in assets
1426517 pimco total is a reliable core bond fund holding for most any investors gross approach is both deliberate and opportunistic he builds the portfolio around pimcos macroeconomic outlook which is developed on a firm wide bases and looks out three to five years
1426518 this outlook is honed and refined quarterly and specific shorter term impacts to interest rates credit and economic factors are considered and used to shape individual security selection
1426519 the fund invests mainly in investment grade bonds of intermediate maturity that means it typically does not make significant interest rate bets despite this moderate sensibility gross has made several moves that should bolster returns
1426520 one pimco total return has avoided treasuries and tips which gross thinks provide poor protection from inflation at current levels the fund has also benefited from exposure to foreign interest rates and currencies especially the euro and emerging markets currencies
1426521 gross has stated his preference for the compelling value of high quality mortgages which have attractive yields relative to treasuries mortgage related securities make up nearly two thirds of the portfolio
1426522 and the fund has emphasized short duration that is lower interest rate sensitivity as evidenced by the portfolios low duration of 4 years relatives to the lehman brothers aggregate bond index duration of 4 5 years
1426523 loomis sayles bond is co managed by dan fuss and kathleen gaffney the 17 9 billion fund is run in a go anywhere fashion and they are not afraid to make significant bets on interest rates or sectors of the economy or the bond market
1426524 their portfolios broad reach makes it reasonably well diversified though and an able core bond holding despite its harder charging approach
1426525 performance has been outstanding the funds 10 year annualized return of 8 5 outpaces the lehman brothers aggregate bond index by 2 7 annual an enormous disparity in bond returns
1426526 the funds performance over the past year has been solid 4 1 return but has lagged the broad index and more conservative peers owing to its narrow holdings of treasuries whose prices soared earlier this year as risk averse investors fled from even high quality assets to treasuries
1426527 the funds average maturity recently 13 8 years and duration 7 years expose it to significantly more interest rate risk than pimco total return however the managers favor securities that have low correlations to the broader bond market and less sensitivity to fluctuations in interest rates
1426528 strong research capabilities allows fuss and gaffney to identify securities they believe to be undervalued and the funds broad mandate allows them to invest wherever such opportunities arise
1426529 as such the portfolio is eclectic it reflects the managers favorite ideas while we are impressed with fuss and gaffneys long term record and apparent managerial acumen much of the funds appeal to us stems from its current positioning with major stakes in investment grade corporate and high yield bonds
1426530 with the help of the united nations we reached a new phrasing for article 24 which was agreed by the kurds and accepted by some of the other mps
1426531 we were surprised by the objections of some other members
1426532 kurds are for the distribution of authority in kirkuk but not equally dividing it
1426533 the division of power should come from the election results
1426534 if we want to reach a convincing result concerning kirkuk this might take a long time and affect the elections
1426535 so we said lets not cripple the country altogether and let the elections go ahead in all provinces while postponing them in kirkuk until consultations are completed
1426536 real ale is a natural living product so there is a much greater intensity of flavours
1426537 one of our objectives is to get people to try it there are fruit beers wheat beers porters stouts milds and golden ales its incredibly diverse so theres something to meet everyones tastes
1426538 pasteurising and filtering a beer kills off a lot of the natural flavours
1426539 a processed keg beer is completely inert a dead flat liquid drawn up to bar with carbon dioxide to put some life in it thats why theyre so fizzy compared to a real ale

1426553 no one can honestly say the impact redistricting will have on unique and successful school programs on magnet schools elective courses and historic school and neighborhood relationships
1426554 the most likely bet is that a lot of harmful effects reside within the unintended consequences of this poorly written proposal
1426555 unfortunately thousands of students in arizona are underserved by the current haphazard system of school districts
1426556 in many cases arizonas current system of school districts segregates students along class and racial lines and perpetuates a history of low expectations for these students
1426557 redistricting will not help the three districts but will hurt them
1426558 a new administration building to house a merged district would strap even the tightest of budgets because school districts cannot print money nor can they go to the corporation commission for rate hikes
1426559 however taxes could be increased eliminating jobs increasing classroom size and destroying the fine arts could save money

1426564 we expect to see both humorous and endearing entries conveying the experience of sharing wardrobes whether its one or two favorite pieces or an entire closet that the two of you swap we want to hear about it
1426565 mothers and daughters have always known that borrowing each others clothes is a great way to expand their wardrobes
1426566 im looking forward to using my expertise to provide solutions to the grand prize winning team and help them choose a new shareable wardrobe from the huge selection of clothing shoes and accessory items available on ebay
1426567 were honored that two great brands will engage our audience with a campaign celebrating the special nature of the mother daughter relationship women everywhere will get the chance to share their memorable experiences with thousands of others across hundreds of social networks
1426568 we are confident the fun and inspiring entries in this campaign will generate increased awareness for both ebay and family circle as premier destinations for todays woman
1426569 were always looking for new ways to discover new beauties
1426570 it was a great location it represents a large part of the county
1426571 they need to get a feel for their personalities because the winner will be like a spokesperson for mario tricoci salon
1426572 everyone always says i should be a model so i figured why not try it
1426573 my links are all telling me theres going to be an announcement that the ville de quebec will be taken from natos standing maritime group and sent to waters off somalia to escort world food programme relief supplies to somalia
1426574 any confirmation would have to come from the government concerned
1426575 if a naval escort is provided by any country we would of course welcome it wholeheartedly
1426576 then we had a danish frigate then we had a dutch frigate which escorted ships sailing mostly from mombasa to mogadishu they escorted i think a total of something like 27 ships with enough food to feed a million people for six months
1426577 we have been appealing for anyone to step forward to protect ships carrying wfp food into somalia especially now because in the coming months we need to double the tonnages that we bring into somalia because the needs have gone up basically we aim to feed 2 4 million people by december
1426578 ninety per cent of wfp food assistance for somalia comes in by sea and it is very very difficult to bring in more by land or even to think of an airlift because neither of those alternatives would be able to bring in the volumes that we need
1426579 it was a relatively small ship we need a continuous supply line of large ships to meet the need in somalia
1426580 thats why its vital to have escorts because if there are one or two attacks on these unescorted ships we could well see that all ship owners say no its not worth the risk we are not willing to go and then the sea lifeline to somalia will be cut completely
1426581 it is extremely worrying particularly because of the increased violence in somalia kidnappings attacks on somali ngo workers in recent weeks plus the violence between the various warring parties
1426582 if we were unable to deliver sufficient food assistance in the coming months we could see a situation similar to the 1992 1993 famine in which hundreds of thousands of people perished
1426583 this year is looking like it will be the worst year for piracy off somalia
1426584 the situation is deteriorating so therefore people with guns see piracy as a purely money making activity
1426585 there is no somali navy as has been eminently demonstrated so theres every cause for the international community to respond to both somalia and the world food programmes request for escorting
1426586 and then the ship itself has got not only its main armament but its got a boarding party that would be incredibly powerful in dealing with the pirate vessels
1426587 i wouldnt discount that but i wouldnt put a whole bunch of emphasis on that given that this task is so fundamentally different from the job we had to do inland
1426588 he said mama im having the best day in my life
1426589 i dont know how many times ive called his cell phone to hear him go this is spencer leave a message
1426590 she just lost her best friend really and her brother you know
1426591 he joined the air force because whitehall is a small town and theres really not much here
1426592 when you first meet spencer hes got like just a way of making you fall in love with him
1426593 he makes you feel like youre his best friend the minute you meet him
1426594 spencer said ill sign up if you hang out with us later
1426595 he would just get up and dance and sing to me in the middle of a store
1426596 he liked to be the center of attention he was a big clown
1426597 from when he was a little kid next door to when i gave him a big hug at graduation there was a smile there was fun
1426598 he would be driving down the road and see something and start making rhymes and they were ridiculous
1426599 he was that guy in the huddle that would get everybody fired up
1426600 i guess us boys were just going to hang out and watch movies

1426651 god is doling out punishment here and i find it interesting that he says
1426652 the implication is that satisfaction is the normal reward for eating and multiplying is the normal reward for intercourse
1426653 apparently god is punishing his people by withholding satisfaction from their eating and childbearing from their sexual immorality

1426685 the enquiry is making good progress and we are following up a number of lines of enquiry some significant thanks to the assistance we have received so far from the public
1426686 we believe todays operation may give added impetus to the enquiry as there may well be people in the area who were there around the same time last tuesday
1426687 they may have seen or heard something which they did not consider material at the time and we would hope to be able to jog their memory and elicit information which might prove to be significant
1426688 as is often the case in such enquiries something they might not have thought worth mentioning could turn out to be vital to our efforts in compiling a picture of the events which led up the attack on mr branigan and bringing to justice whoever was responsible for his death
1426689 it may well be that people have been away from aberdeen since last week and have been unaware of our appeals for information
1426690 i would urge anyone who may have information even second hand information which they have heard from someone else to let us know i can assure them their information will be treated in confidence

1426720 we believe the circuit city chain has significant structural disadvantages 55 of its stores are the antiquated larger
1426721 at this time we have a cautious view on several major product categories and believe mass merchant competition is intensifying bby is best in class in nearly all regards and we have confidence in managements abilities to expand the chain into new areas both domestically and abroad however we believe a hold rating is most appropriate until the consumer backdrop improves until upcoming product cycles become more favorable and until the international investments begin to yield more meaningful returns
1426722 following extensive research into clinicians needs weve designed a laptop sized system that can help them get to patients quickly no matter where they are in the hospital or clinic and which can produce high quality images regardless of the difficulty of the situation at hand
1426723 clinicians told us that small portable systems are beneficial as long as the image quality can help them make a confident diagnosis if poor image quality from a handheld system results in inconclusive data repeat exams may be needed at the cost of additional time and money the cx50 was designed to consistently deliver high quality images even in technically challenging patients
1426724 philips cx50 compactxtreme system is truly the most advanced ultrasound system available today because its excellent image quality allows us to diagnose our patients quickly and confidently at the bedside
1426725 the combination of purewave technology and xres processing enables the system to deliver the same image quality as full size systems allowing full echo data analysis from a portable system without any compromises

1426765 i believe we have achieved a considerable progress over such a short time period
1426766 currently we have a continuous presence of humans in space not only living in space but performing complicated activities and tasks performing science experiments and it has been going on for years
1426767 i guess it is a milestone and i guess im just the person that happened to be in the right place at the right time
1426768 i certainly dont want to be the last female commander of the space station and i dont anticipate that to be the case
1426769 it really didnt become a reality to me to become a goal until i graduated from high school which was coincidentally the same year they picked the first set of female astronauts
1426770 i think that was when i decided i wanted to become an astronaut
1426771 when i was growing up almost every boy wanted to be a cosmonaut every spaceflight was so unusual and so exciting
1426772 i was offered an opportunity to go into the space program and i agreed and i never regretted it later
1426773 you know i would like to say that i spent a fair amount of time aboard the space station last time
1426774 so in a way it feels like you are coming home
1426775 now what we are seeing is very active development and assembly of the station
1426776 its always beautiful to look at the earth and to photograph it
1426777 to me its not just about going into space even though i have been dreaming about going into space since i was 10
1426778 i hope to come back and promote the space program back in malaysia

1426802 i am thinking of running this test on one of my sites which has not been touched in over an year and just do this and watch what happens and then remove nofollow and then watch again and then add again and see what happens might prove the point because that website does not have the authority status as seomoz no content being added no links being added not that i know of etc

1426821 has confirmed his complete desire to finish with rugby league to switch over to union
1426822 hell be at the very least in the stadium or better on the team sheet
1426823 our problem is is williams under contract with another rugby union side the answer is no
1426824 therefore hes free to join with whoever he wants he doesnt need a letter to leave
1426825 very serene very determined to make his entry into rugby union
1426826 that seems to be a closed chapter in his career
1426827 in my view williams should finish his season with his club in australia and then come to france
1426828 i find it funny and bizarre that a player would break his contract in the middle of the season to go somewhere else
1426829 there is a rule in the french competition that a player can finish his season in australia and then come to france midway through the season
1426830 at a basic level we dont believe anybody should break their contract

1426847 weve just been off our game against a team like melbourne you cant be off ten or twenty per cent
1426848 youve really got to be there in every aspect of the game individually and as a team
1426849 if you dont then theyll make you pay its really clear that weve got to prepare well
1426850 its not a season defining game for either side but its certainly a game that we want to win in front of what i think will be one of the biggest crowds well see at brooky for quite a while
1426851 its a big clash its top of the table its on a friday night and its at brookie it doesnt get any bigger really
1426852 we havent been happy the last couple of weeks weve been putting probably 50 or 60 minutes together but really lacking in the last 20 thats pretty much the main focus to play the full 80

1426856 better than the last two olympic games sydney 2000 was tough athens 2004 was extremely tough and this will probably be harder again
1426857 a gold medal would just mean a cherry on top of this cake
1426858 i have already got the icing and i have already got the base so a cherry would be just a nice bit on the top it doesnt really matter if i dont have it the cake is still nice anyway
1426859 for me i had to change my attitude because it was all about the ultimate result and i became too focused on that rather than focusing on what i had to do to get there
1426860 i dont think its any secret that most athletes their ultimate goal would be to win a gold medal
1426861 it would be completely arrogant of us to say were going to win
1426862 but we know if we do our job properly then we will have a very good chance and make it very difficult for everyone else

1427025 its our desire in small numbers to actually progress as humans to do things in a different way to others and to be able to set a new benchmark that we can set for future generations
1427026 the more important thing is not what the champion does today but how they inspire the champions of the future
1427027 and it is those future champions that im inspired to encourage and that is why we do what we do

1427030 the judge ruled today that because hes evaded being served with the subpoena for so long hes obviously doing it for a reason and we can have what is called substitute of service which means you can put it onto someone else
1427031 were now serving the subpoena via text message via the toulon club and via his address in sydney
1427032 the idea is that we go back into court friday morning seeking an injunction and then if he decides to play in the face of the injunction then he can be up for some serious penalties
1427033 people who dont have anything to hide are usually easy to serve
1427034 weve spent a lot of time and effort and a lot of long nights dealing with trying to find out where he is
1427035 hell be at the very least in the stadium or better on the team sheet
1427036 he has confirmed his complete desire to finish with rugby league to switch over to union
1427037 our problem is is williams under contract with another rugby union side the answer is no
1427038 therefore hes free to join with whoever he wants he doesnt need a letter to leave
1427039 its about taking action against people who have induced a breach of contract where that leads im not sure

1427044 senator mccain wants americans to forget that during the republican primary he said that americans were better off than we were eight years ago and that he thinks weve made great progress economically he wants us to forget that hes fully embraced the bush policies he once opposed
1427045 the truth is being a maverick isnt practicing the same kind of politics we have seen from washington for decades
1427046 mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1427047 senator mccain not only wants oil companies to keep every dime of that money that theyve been making he wants to give them more
1427048 the oil companies have placed their bets on senator mccain and if he wins theyre going to continue to cash in while ordinary families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1427049 wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks
1427050 we will have to reflect with calmness and tranquillity on the future of the olympic torch relay
1427051 we respect protests and freedom of expression but violence is against the olympic spirit
1427052 we believe in the strong symbolism of the torch relay
1427053 it is illusory to think the simple elimination of the international relay will make all the problems disappear
1427054 the torch relay attracts the media and the media attracts the protesters to make it only a national relay will not solve all the problems
1427055 after these incidents we are convinced more than ever that we need to cherish and preserve the flame
1427056 we must make all efforts to make sure these incidents are never repeated again it is a hope i dont know if it will become a reality

1427060 i feel happy to transfer to ac milan i am a professional footballer every transfer is a new start for me
1427061 but for the moment the most important thing is the olympics its a great honour to represent brazil in the games
1427062 my goal is to create history for brazil the olympics is as important as the world cup and copa america everybody wants to be the champion in the olympic games

1427066 however there is more to do if we are to realise the maximum benefits from this discovery
1427067 they produce enzymes that clean wounds they make a wound more alkaline which may slow bacterial growth and finally they produce a range of antibacterial chemicals that stop the bacteria growing
1427068 the understanding that i was briefed on this groups plans is incorrect
1427069 expanding super rugby is what the game needs there is no deviation from the aim
1427070 sanzars current position is that its very much a three country expansion of super rugby with south africa involved
1427071 the trans tasman idea does not include south africa and that is absolutely not the nzrus preferred position at the moment
1427072 at this stage sanzar is unified in new zealand australian and south african teams being involved in super rugby and tri nations going forward
1427073 the sanzar alliance oversees the toughest super 14 competition in the world and waratahs are right behind the vision to expand

1427078 we would like to remind you that windows xp service pack 3 sp3 will be released to automatic updates shortly
1427079 we were astounded by the fact his maximal heart rate was still up so high
1427080 we dont know why it is its something unique to him i havent seen it before and i might not see it again
1427081 his physiology is unique his psychology is unique how he deals with preparing for work is unique
1427082 hes just a mixture of everything youre looking for in an elite athlete thats what allows him to keep going for six olympics
1427083 it crystallised for me in munich in early may when we were doing double training sessions rowing morning and afternoon
1427084 it was 30 or 40 per cent more than we were doing the same time the year before and after training james would put his running shoes on and run back to the hotel
1427085 i knew then that he was close to peak fitness
1427086 i would say hes fitter now than hes ever been i think hes even surprised himself this time around hes done an amazing job
1427087 maybe when i was young i was a little bit more dynamically strong explosive strength
1427088 i really attended to that in the gym to make sure thats ok and everything else is fine
1427089 ive been training exactly the same as the 20 year olds and 21 year olds in the crew and managed to get here in one piece
1427090 hes not the sort of guy who gets really geed up theres a few other boys in the boat who like a bit of that but james is much more calm and relaxed
1427091 james doesnt talk heaps but when he does talk everyone listens
1427092 hes very confident he doesnt necessarily have to be in front as long as he thinks the rhythms right and the powers there he will come over the top of the other crews
1427093 you can feel all the forces being combined together in a really efficient way and you just squeeze
1427094 it doesnt feel hard youre still putting a huge amount of effort in but it feels coordinated and really well timed
1427095 and when you get in that situation it feels unbreakable its hard to get in there but once youre in there its actually quite hard to get out of it because people have locked into it
1427096 the boats just flying along really smoothly and it feels great
1427097 thats when you start to look for that state and even at the end when the rating goes up you actually can stay in there
1427098 marty rabjohns our coxswain calls something and we respond immediately all together
1427099 your mind is in the zone and you make the most of it you cross the finish line and youre as exhausted as ever but youve probably got to the finish line five seconds quicker over the course
1427100 we hope to give them a surprise i was talking to richo coach brian richardson and were just really happy with the way the crew is rowing but also im really happy with the way im rowing just in the last couple of weeks

1427105 with the help of the united nations we reached a new phrasing for article 24 which was agreed by the kurds and accepted by some of the other mps
1427106 we were surprised by the objections of some other members
1427107 kurds are for the distribution of authority in kirkuk but not equally dividing it
1427108 the division of power should come from the election results
1427109 if we want to reach a convincing result concerning kirkuk this might take a long time and affect the elections
1427110 so we said lets not cripple the country altogether and let the elections go ahead in all provinces while postponing them in kirkuk until consultations are completed
1427111 this case in my mind illustrates the need for the afl to consider when they do their review of the rules at the end of the year introducing a specific offence for contact of this nature
1427112 this has been done with respect to front on contact and with respect to head high contact and in my view that was very appropriate
1427113 there is a need for a specific offence that takes into account a dangerous tackle or a throw tackle or as it is called in rugby league a spear tackle but that is a matter for the afl

1427117 there was nothing that definitely proved to us that it has to be shut down
1427118 i think the question parents have to ask themselves is is it worth one extra day a week for my kids when people in this part of town wont have a library
1427119 pillet said referencing the citys plans to make up for shutting main library by keeping all the branch libraries in other parts of town open longer hours
1427120 i dont think the public in good conscience can make that decision and decide that
1427121 we know exactly where we are at at the moment and we have to change a few things
1427122 i think on the weekend we showed patches of good form
1427123 but to be a good side in this competition being so even you have to be able to consistently produce it week in week out quarter by quarter which the top sides like geelong have been able to do and we are not producing that at the moment
1427124 it was the second quarter when our concentration lapsed letting a flood of goals in cost us the game
1427125 the western bulldogs are still sitting in the top four and they are a good side
1427126 so to be able to do that for three quarters is good but not good enough in the afl competition weve got to consistently be able to do it
1427127 you get knocked around a bit with your confidence when you lose games of footy but we are just looking forward to the challenge getting a win on the board hopefully on the weekend and then move forward
1427128 we are not a side that is probably playing like they should be fourth at the moment but we are really looking forward to the challenge this week
1427129 it was great to be able to bring some kids in you get that enthusiasm and confidence
1427130 adam goodes will be close and leo barry will be up and around the mark we just have to pick the best possible team we can

1427143 theres obviously interest there but i really think if the players dont agree or dont feel its a realistic opportunity theres no use doing it
1427144 often players have felt they havent had as big an input into administrative decisions so its a great time for the administrators and the players to get together and work towards it if everyone believes in it
1427145 the players ive spoken to believe in it and theyd love to be part of some sort of push to get in there and at least present our case
1427146 id be more than happy to be involved in that
1427147 i guess its more of an international cricket council agenda and it will be interesting to see how they move from these discussions
1427148 the idea of twenty20 cricket at the olympics is definitely worth pursuing

1427158 valery borchin and vladimir kanaikin both failed to pass a recent dope test and are unlikely to compete at beijing
1427159 alexei voevodin who was not included in the olympic team also failed to pass testing

1427161 but he will be back into full training by the end of the week and will certainly be fit to race in beijing
1427162 together with the executive council of the russian olympic committee we decided not to include gusev in the olympic team
1427163 denis menchov will replace gusev and will compete in beijing in the time trial race together with vladimir karpets
1427164 though his results do not indicate the use of forbidden substances vladimirs values exceeded the normal parameters established by dr damsgaard and were not compliant with the strict agreement signed by all thirty riders

1427175 well its like i said you make your bed you lie in it

1427197 he is the fastest of the three and he is the most dangerous
1427198 for many of us it will be the last time we compete in an olympic games so we will approach it with more intensity and more emotion

1427213 we all want an alternative to what the federal government originally proposed i think theres a consensus that there are some real fundamental flaws in it
1427214 so we all know that we can only come up with that alternative if we all keep working together
1427215 in some areas we see very high ambient air emissions and in other areas we see less
1427216 so you may manage areas differently depending on how big a problem you have environmentally
1427217 at the end of the day well have to achieve agreement and it remains to be seen whether the government will find this an acceptable attractive alternative to what theyve already proposed

1427220 the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1427221 over time the substantial easing of monetary policy combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth
1427222 while we continue to expect paid claims to increase throughout 2008 the rate at which claims are being paid has begun to slow somewhat due to loss mitigation opportunities as well as from various state and lender foreclosure moratoriums and the overall volume of potential foreclosures in the marketplace

1427452 moreover the uncertainty of the extent of the intrusions continues to cause plaintiff a great deal of anguish and suffering

1427475 you would never see that the women be the main event but the ratings speak for themselves the guys in tna work their butts off theres no doubt about it but in the history of wrestling nobody has ever looked at the women
1427476 nobody has ever looked at the women as actual competition for the men
1427477 it already has before the knockouts division i would say no because look what the prime focus of the competition of womens wrestling was it was bra and panties matches it was lingerie swimming pools jell o matches pillow fights that will not compare to any form of mens wrestling
1427478 now with the knockouts were getting the highest rated segments on the show we wrestle and people want to see us theyre demanding to see us theyre actually tuning in to see us

1427516 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store

1427518 the mobileme launch clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about internet services
1427519 definitely these two teams bring out the best in each other i think the familiarity for our players with australia for us both in the wnba and internationally when they play in the leagues in the winter i think they just know each other very well the top level athlete is so competitive and they have so much pride that it wouldnt matter if they were playing for marbles i think theyd go just as hard this was great to see and it was great preparation absolutely the best preparation we could have going into next week

1427535 as president i would deploy at least two additional brigades to afghanistan to re enforce our counter terrorism operations and support natos efforts against the taliban
1427536 as we step up our commitment our european friends must do the same and without the burdensome restrictions that have hampered natos efforts
1427537 if there was security in the south why would we come here

1427550 this should not have been in the glare of press discussions in august 2008 as we have all known that this could be a problem ever since beijing were elected and we should have taken whatever steps necessary

1427632 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate there are some things we need to go through
1427633 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1427634 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1427635 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1427636 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1427637 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around
1427638 we should restore our position in cuba and other countries
1427639 we agreed on the priority for the direction of cooperation

1427641 i am happy to be back in the east where i can use my size and defensive prowess more to my advantage than i could out west i am excited by the way the team has embraced me this is a class organization
1427642 i cant speak for mr joe dumars but i think they see what a lot of people dont see this is a team that takes pride in defense and they put a premium on players who play hard at that end i think i am one of the most underrated defensive players in the league and this is a place where i can flourish at that end of the floor
1427643 i could name all sorts of things injuries a lot of things but i am not going to do that the past is past and i am not going to disrespect my new team by saying anything that sounds like an excuse i have a chance to rewrite my own legacy thats what i am setting out to do this is my home now
1427644 it takes a whole lot to hurt me i have heard it all and been through it all i am only 26 but i have been through more than the average man can imagine this is what we sign up for in this business your shortcomings are played up in the media and blown up 10 fold people that base their criticisms of me from those things dont really know me anybody who has sat down and broke bread with me and gotten to know me they dont have a problem with me
1427645 when i called the sophomores and redshirt freshmen up to sing the fight song sunday night there wasnt enough room up there to stand
1427646 when i called the seniors up there it was a very small group its a good thing for the future
1427647 we put our hand in the fire right off the bat and i dont think thats a bad thing for this football team
1427648 we have to establish our leadership were a young football team we have to find out who is truly going to lead in adverse situations
1427649 well find out a little bit about ourselves i think its good to find out about ourselves as early as possible
1427650 the players had good enthusiasm and they worked extremely hard
1427651 i asked them raise your hand if youre in the best shape of your athletic careers and i think they all raised their hands
1427652 all of our team is in better shape they got through the first practice which was pretty intense they got through it very well the key for us is to continue to do that were not in game shape but were in better shape than we were in the spring
1427653 its more intense more like every practice is like game day
1427654 its all about business no joking around but were going to have fun its more amped up than it used to be
1427655 it was hard it was harder than what we did under coach lloyd carr it was just faster no breaks we couldnt take our helmets off couldnt take a knee
1427656 but hes practicing and hes done enough to earn his status back on the team but he has not done enough yet to warrant playing time theres going to be some playing suspension but thats yet to be determined
1427657 we knew you guys were filming that was just playing around
1427658 hes certainly going to be a weapon for us on offense

1427666 i think in addition to greenwashing pg amp e is now engaged in gay washing given their inappropriate attacks on assemblyman mark leno
1427667 i think there is pretty resounding resentment in the gay community for pg amp es tactics it is kind of obvious they are trying now to court favor in a community they offended with their unsavory tactics
1427668 i would think our community might feel we have been significantly shorted by their 250 000 contribution
1427669 everything was going very well until we arrived in maoz esther
1427670 from behind a little hill suddenly emerged some cars and policemen wearing civilian clothes but with police hats and they arrested the one who shot in the air as well as some of our other escorts who were carrying weapons
1427671 apparently the police were waiting and watching the whole time doing nothing until our boy shot in the air
1427672 the fact is that police forces were there we understood that like last week when there was a violent incident when the hikers came to the bedouin with weapons we were ready because we knew that this was a place of confrontation the bedouin set up cameras and therefore the police were there
1427673 if the police were there and watched the confrontation why did the police not just stand openly and prevent the hikers from passing if it was not permitted why did they not just stop them the situation as i see it looks like an ambush hiding out like thieves in the night
1427674 im not the one who decides there are officers above me who decide what is overt and what is concealed
1427675 i have asked the public security minister avi dichter for a response and i expect to receive an answer within a few days i have no doubt that the police were engaged in a provocation just as they have been in other places such as a recent incident in the southern mount hevron area and elsewhere
1427676 another step in the police agreeing to become a political police in the service of the olmert government

1427726 the speculation is entertaining for sure and sometimes accurate but the process is anything but transparent
1427727 the hurry up world of 24 7 media and blogs assumes
1427728 but we also found that when people want to make a report related to fraud or any unethical behavior they look for confidentiality and ease of making the report
1427729 sometimes fraud reporters are in an open environment when they notice some form of irregularity
1427730 its a problem to pick up a phone because theres a danger that someone else could hear the conversation using this system they can easily sms the message over to us without anyone even suspecting where the message came from
1427731 what started out as a purely text based reporting mechanism expanded because people can take video clips or photos using their cell phones of the scene of an alleged offense that is taking place
1427732 for some reason we have found that people make the reports but they fail to give us the precise details
1427733 the misty air is not a feature of pollution but a feature of evaporation and humidity
1427734 most people who consume alcohol in the united states drink in ways that may increase their risk of the metabolic syndrome and related conditions
1427735 prevention efforts should focus on reducing alcohol consumption to safer levels
1427736 unfortunately few physicians screen their patients about alcohol use or are knowledgeable about guidelines that define low risk or moderate drinking
1427737 in treatment naive patients atazanavir ritonavir once daily demonstrated similar antiviral efficacy to lopinavir ritonavir twice daily with less gastrointestinal toxicity but with a higher rate of hyperbilirubinaemia the results of this study support the use of once daily atazanavir ritonavir as a recommended first line treatment option with a number of patient benefits over the currently recommended ritonavir boosted twice daily lopinavir for the treatment of hiv infected antiretroviral naive patients
1427738 our long term goal should be to alter our lifestyle accordingly beginning in infancy or early childhood
1427739 instituting a low saturated fat low cholesterol diet in infancy 7 months is perfectly safe without adverse effects
1427740 our review of the literature convinces us that more aggressive and earlier intervention will probably prevent considerably more than 30 percent of coronary heart disease
1427741 studies show that fatty streak lesions in the arteries that are a precursor to atherosclerosis and heart disease begin in childhood and advanced lesions are not uncommon by age 30 why not nip things in the bud
1427742 a concerted national effort might dramatically reduce morbidity and mortality due to three major chronic diseases it would take generations to achieve and it would require an all out commitment of money and manpower to re educate and modify the behavior of a nation is that impossible no we have already shown that even a frankly addictive behavior like can be overcome eventually
1427743 i dont know if we can jump to that conclusion yet
1427744 we need to study this further we do know from two large scale clinical trials that smokers benefited more when they got plavix therapy maybe smoking does something to make plavix work better
1427745 current smoking was an independent predictor of low platelet aggregation
1427746 were trying to get funding for a trial right now
1427747 then we would remove the smoking in half the group
1427748 we would see whether that removal adds support for our observation
1427749 and were definitely not telling people to smoke if they have
1427750 this study shows that immunotherapy is safe and well tolerated and could ultimately be beneficial for this high risk population
1427751 we now know that the immune system of patients recovering from chemotherapy is malleable so we just need to find the best immunological approach to exploit this window of opportunity
1427752 physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors varied widely among children in various ethnic immigrant groups
1427753 for example 22 5 percent of immigrant hispanic children were physically inactive compared with 9 5 percent of u s born white children with u s born parents
1427754 previous findings have shown that fish and fish oil can help prevent stroke but this is one of the only studies that looks at fishs effect on silent brain infarcts in healthy older people
1427755 while eating tuna and other types of fish seems to help protect against memory loss and stroke these results were not found in people who regularly ate fried fish
1427756 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role
1427757 no one takes any notice when i say that its to do with my hormones
1427758 we are proud of the science but the best thing is seeing the great improvement in our patients quality of life
1427759 one woman who had been a nurse developed schizophrenia soon after she had a baby and had the worst form of the illness for eight years she was more in hospital than out she made a dramatic improvement on estrogen and went from being unable to even attend to her personal hygiene constant auditory hallucinations and paranoia to now being able to work as a clerical assistant and live independently
1427760 estrogen is very interesting besides its actions as a sex hormone it plays many roles in the brain
1427761 we are going to be seeing more of this approach spurred on by the kulkarni studies and other papers
1427762 patients and families should not be rushing to their psychiatrists and asking for estrogen patches
1427763 but they should watch the news coming out of this work carefully
1427764 there is a lot to be done but i believe that we have opened up a new and promising area of treatment for a debilitating illness in both women and men
1427765 there are too many unknowns in this study to make conclusions about the relationship between cough and cold medicine and altes
1427766 they raised a lot of possibilities but the question is what do you do in follow up
1427767 theres a lot of evidence to support the idea that when kids watch violent media they become more aggressive
1427768 and yet violent media has become easier and easier to access for children so for the movie industry the message is that the 1960s ratings system needs to be updated and made more explicit and relevant to the way movies are being distributed and seen today
1427769 but also parents need to be much more careful about how their children consume violent media
1427770 and in any case the american movie industry rates itself
1427771 so how and why some movies get an r rating while others dont isnt always rational because its like the fox watching the chicken coop and the industry is not going to do anything that limits it from getting as wide an audience as possible
1427772 theres quite a lot of validity to what these researchers are saying
1427773 children are definitely far more able to access this kind of violent material and its potentially worrying but the evidence isnt really there yet that theres a negative consequence
1427774 but there just arent any studies that have shown a direct connection to problem behavior and what the connection is independent of a host of other factors for example children who are more violent in the first place tend to be the ones drawn more to material that is more violent so even the direction of any relationship is not clear
1427775 parents have to navigate a minefield of calories fat and salt to find them
1427776 parents want to feed their children healthy meals but americas chain restaurants are setting parents up to fail
1427777 is much more explicit than any recommendation out there right now
1427778 the time frame is that the benefit if there is any from screening is 10 years
1427779 the average life expectancy for men over 75 years is less than 10 years so screening them can do more harm than good
1427780 there is uncertainty about whether the benefits exceed the harm based on existing evidence
1427781 most of the harms are related to treatment rather than screening
1427782 men under the age of 75 should try to make an informed choice at this time
1427783 the current evidence is not enough for us to know the balance between benefit and harm
1427784 that discussion should occur before screening occurs and should include what the test does and does not mean the consequences of finding
1427785 will not sit well with oncologists and a lot of people
1427786 as medical oncologists we are always trying to be one step ahead of the cancer
1427787 we are trying to intervene earlier and identify patients who are at risk we always want to intercede to do something
1427788 these patients are very informed and their view will be at odds with the recommendations
1427789 these are not the 75 year olds of 50 years ago these are physically younger people still actively functioning sexually in many cases
1427790 we are starting to make recommendations that some people be screened by the age of 35
1427791 the american cancer society since 1997 has been against mass screening
1427792 but within the physician patient relationship a test should be offered to the patient with the patient informed of the potential risks and potential benefits so he can make an informed decision
1427793 but we are in the process of re evaluating our recommendations for men of all ages
1427794 more than 80 percent of the dive injuries occurred from a dive height of less than or equal to one meter so that is not the highest dive this is usually from the lowest order or the edge of the pool
1427795 this really suggests the need for increased prevention efforts to lower the risk of diving related injuries
1427796 theres a lot that can be done to make diving a safer recreational activity or sport
1427797 having a lifeguard or other supervision present is really important
1427798 what is most interesting to me as a pediatrician with a mind for prevention is what may also be among the most predictable findings of the study that diving injury peaks substantially during the summer months and that boys are far more likely to be injured than girls
1427799 the summer month exposure will surprise no one males are more affected by nearly all types of injury particularly unintentional injury
1427800 we tend to teach children well to stay in the shallow end when they are small
1427801 we do less of a good job teaching about the risks of diving or marking dive safe zones as they grow
1427802 furthermore our results demonstrate an important relationship between rem sleep and high bmi and obesity suggesting that the short sleep obesity association may be attributed to reduced rem sleep time and decreased activity during rem sleep
1427803 you can hunt around and you will find a few kids meals that are nutritionally pretty good
1427804 but the vast majority of meals are too high in calories saturated fat or sodium they are all made with refined white flour rather than whole wheat flour not the kind of meals we ought to be encouraging people to eat
1427805 kfc is proud to offer a variety of kids meals for those looking for lower calorie lower fat options
1427806 a 2007 consumer survey conducted by the association showed that four out of five customers said there were more healthy options available and more food choices available than there were two years earlier
1427807 look for grilled or baked items such as grilled chicken or grilled lean burgers and avoid fried foods
1427808 choose low fat or skim milk or 100 fruit juice over other beverages that simply provide calories without nutritional value
1427809 milk and juices typically come in small portions appropriate for children
1427810 however sodas and shakes made for kids are often more than enough for an adult
1427811 many complementary methods are extremely popular among cancer survivors who are spending a lot of their time money and attention on them
1427812 for this reason it is important to determine which are helpful not only for shrinking tumors and extending survival but also for relieving symptoms and improving quality of life
1427813 in general younger more educated and more affluent cancer survivors were more likely to use complementary methods
1427814 people with more advanced cancer were more likely to be complementary method users
1427815 this is not only because ovarian cancer is obviously limited to women and
1427816 scientific studies of complementary methods have become much more common during the past few years but there is still a lot of uncertainty about the effectiveness of many complementary methods
1427817 as more studies are done to evaluate effectiveness we will want to know whether men are missing opportunities to use some effective complementary methods that are far more popular in women or whether women use ineffective complementary methods more than men or whether some complementary methods are more effective for women than they are for men
1427818 this study like many before it confirms that cancer patients actively pursue a variety of alternative and complementary therapies usually in conjunction with standard approaches to cancer treatment
1427819 it is not known but it is not thought that these have an impact on cancer related outcomes though many patients report deriving comfort solace or symptom relief with such practices
1427820 this is something that is very true in my clinical experience
1427821 the uninsured cant get in to see the doctor they miss medications their blood pressure is out of control and really you see devastating consequences
1427822 these people are going to end up with complications of their illnesses prematurely they will be disabled early they will probably die younger it is a major public health disaster
1427823 longer term there will be expensive admissions to hospitals usually through the emergency department due to because of hypertension
1427824 we found some pretty striking differences when we compared uninsured individuals with one of these seven conditions with insured individuals with one of the conditions
1427825 these are conditions that we take care of in the clinic we know that we can prevent disabling complications or catastrophe if we are able to manage these conditions
1427826 it is interesting that chronic conditions are more common among people with insurance than without but that isnt surprising either people with a chronic condition are likely to place a higher value on their coverage and work harder to get and keep it
1427827 but having insurance is not likely to prove to be a panacea for these folks
1427828 people with chronic conditions who are insured are not doing so well either we do not do a very good job of delivering chronic care in this country for anyone
1427829 children have no control over their family situation so its encouraging to find that the amount of quality time that they have with their parents is largely unaffected by their family arrangement
1427830 city of ambition is a series of colour photographs from chongqing one of the largest cities in the world
1427831 i am mostly interested in the outskirts of chongqing where the city cant really be seen but rather sensed also construction sites and places of change are of main interest to me they show us metaphorical facets of the huge changes taking place in contemporary china astonishingly chongqing is an unknown place for most people in the western world the city is located in southwest chinas region of sichuan and was the capital of china during world war ii the municipality is populated by approximately 32 million people

1427839 we think etfs are a very logical extension of our business we view the etf as an important delivery mechanism for our strategies
1427840 i t is a known fact that ucits have segregated assets with respect to those of the companies which take care of their creation management administration and marketing activities therefore etfs are not subject to the insolvency risk in the event of default of the above mentioned companies
1427841 i had always considered myself a connoisseur of dark stories

1427843 ask anyone living in a rural community whos paying 4 for gas and who is watching their young people leave and schools close and theyll tell you that the bush coleman economy isnt working for them
1427844 i think more than anyone else the folks in this room know the difference between talk and results
1427845 what id ask people to do is simply step back and ask themselves a fundamental question what is it that any of us have done in our lives to merit the humbling opportunity to serve you in the u s senate

1427850 it is time to create a conservative production company or at least a production company open to conservative themes such a production company could make great epics that hollywood has so far failed to make
1427851 a loose knit network of entertainers who share common beliefs like supporting u s troops and traditional american values
1427852 functioned like a support group organizing informal gatherings where actors producers screenwriters key grips and other industry types can share common values or discuss concerns like anti americanism in hollywood movies or the perception of industry bias

1427855 my plans are to leave this tent up until there is no longer a need for it and that means i will leave it up until the county builds a shelter or jesus comes and at the rate they are going jesus will come first
1427856 we are looking to enforce the codes and make sure what facilities are being provided are safe and in our opinion allowing people to sleep in a tent in this fashion is not a safe thing to do

1427864 the instrumentation is a joke on us culture brazil grew up with european influences principally from portugal but is more influenced now by us now we want to be winners like americans
1427865 the us is very interested in brazil now as an area for american expansion and investment and brazil is now ready for this there will be more jobs improved infrastructure if america stops making wars and starts investing
1427866 cru was international this is for the brazilian audience who wanted some traditional samba samba rock ballads and gafiera to dance to and enjoy at weekend barbecues

1427870 the musicians we covered are people we all listen to pretty religiously
1427871 theyre all bands that im a huge fan of and wanted to tell the world its a shortlist of everyone i love that people may or may not have heard of or may or may not have thought that i would be into theyre my desert island songs
1427872 some of the songs are really similar theyre just a little more revved up
1427873 it depends on the song some things its good to just put a twist on and others like the fiona apple song are completely changed you think what direction do i want to see this go how can i make this sound like my bands doing it the songs are already written so the hard parts over with its basically just messing around in the studio until you strike gold its the most fun ive ever had
1427874 all these projects had come to fruition at once but not through any specific plan
1427875 they just all started happening at the same time all this stuff was destined to be together in one package
1427876 we have a similar game in america but the players wear pads and helmets and stop playing and go to the hospital when they get all bloody

1427903 no es posible asegurar las m nimas condiciones para garantizar el xito tanto pol tico como econ mico de la fiesta por lo que ha decidido
1427904 a pesar del excelente apoyo que siempre hemos recibido del grupo de concejales de iu en el ayuntamiento de madrid desde la empresa madrid espacios y congresos que es quien gestiona la casa de campo se ha venido desarrollando una pol tica de privatizaci n y encarecimiento de los espacios que ven amos utilizando que cada a o hac an m s inviable econ micamente el resultado de la fiesta
1427905 con el pretexto de las obras de remodelaci n de la zona la posibilidad de reservar el espacio
1427906 se neg la colaboraci n y los espacios para la realizaci n de la fiesta como es el caso del ayuntamiento de rivas gobernado por iu
1427907 atra an al p blico necesario para financiar con la entrada al conjunto de los gastos de la fiesta se agot hace a os
1427908 festival m s y no siempre el mejor ni el m s barato
1427909 otro handicap a adido al encarecimiento de los costes de la fiesta
1427910 todo esto nos ha llevado a reducir en los ltimos a os en m s de un 50 por ciento la venta de bonos y entradas en taquilla
1427911 la situaci n econ mica por la que atraviesa el comit federal de todos conocida y de la que hemos venido dando cuenta en distintas reuniones de los rganos de direcci n ha impedido tambi n que pudi ramos asumir el d ficit que estamos seguro esta fiesta hubiera generado en otras ocasiones el cumplimiento por parte de iu del protocolo econ mico con el pce ayud a superar estas situaciones ahora con un protocolo firmado pero que se incumple desde hace m s de quince meses esto era imposible
1427912 as pues con la voluntad de poner en pie una nueva fiesta del pce que siga teniendo como elementos centrales el debate pol tico el intercambio de ideas dar voz a los que no la tienen el encuentro entre camaradas y amigos la cultura y el ocio nos ponemos a trabajar desde hoy mismo para conseguirlo
1427913 the character of large parts of englands countryside is changing as a result of built development demand for new development is significantly higher per household in rural areas than urban areas and the countryside has seen a greater number of new houses than in the urban fringe in recent years
1427914 the decline in services in rural areas continues to concern rural communities each year we have found there are fewer outlets for many services and poorer accessibility to services for people without cars
1427915 we found that public concerns about the effects of migration are not necessarily based on prejudice but can arise from genuine anxieties about practical issues such as the effect of migration on housing and other local services
1427916 local services are unable to respond to rapid population changes and are left under funded as a result of the current funding system this situation is putting local public services under pressure
1427917 the scale of the pressures on the countryside from large scale housing schemes and other intrusive development are making rural england a place which needs more careful protection than ever before

1427926 for people who think that this is going to lead us to disenfranchise any gay or lesbian person they are sadly mistaken
1427927 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
1427928 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
1427929 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs

1427938 imagine if we allowed private organizations to take on the less fortunate in our area without the oppressive heavy hand of our county government breathing down their back to comply with unrelated and ridiculous regulations we would have greater participation from the private community to effectively help the homeless and the unemployed if government would just get out of the way one instance i recall was where a business i was involved decided to give out sodas grilled hot dogs and grilled hamburgers to the public on our own private property we were shut down within two hours by code enforcement for not having a permit we were shocked we would need to get permission from the government to feed the public

1427975 the edwans are a large clan that include top hamas supporters
1427976 speaking to wnd the two brothers praised obama and admitted giving the money online to his campaign they said they are not
1427977 monir and hasam edwan denied their financial transactions online listed as donations in
1427978 fec spokesman biersack told wnd contributions from overseas are allowed if the donations are coming from
1427979 he said there are strict guidelines against accepting more than 2 300 from one individual during a single election

1427992 the salt marsh can support these large numbers of animals because of its high productivity the grasses particularly spartina alternaflora the algae diatoms and dinoflagellates and the phytoplankton account for the systems production of organic matter that may approach 10 tons per acre per year
1427993 compare this with the productivity of the continental shelf which amounts to 1 3 tons per acre per year or the open ocean figure of 0 5 and the value for these fragile wetlands takes on increased importance
1427994 even the best of our fertile farmlands will produce only 6 to 7 tons per acre per year while the average farm produces between 3 to 5 tons
1427995 most of the organic material the marsh produces is not even consumed by marsh animals but rather is washed into the tidal estuaries where it supports large numbers of marine organisms

1428008 mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook

1428017 but we also found that when people want to make a report related to fraud or any unethical behavior they look for confidentiality and ease of making the report
1428018 sometimes fraud reporters are in an open environment when they notice some form of irregularity
1428019 its a problem to pick up a phone because theres a danger that someone else could hear the conversation using this system they can easily sms the message over to us without anyone even suspecting where the message came from
1428020 what started out as a purely text based reporting mechanism expanded because people can take video clips or photos using their cell phones of the scene of an alleged offense that is taking place

1428062 any time you miss games and youre not part of the action and youre in a pennant race its no fun to sit and watch i guess it made it a little easier because of the way we were playing
1428063 we were not shooting well and their defense took away a lot of driving areas they got really hot in the second half to put a lot of game pressure on our guys and i thought our guys handled it well on a night where from the free throw line or from the three point things were not easy for us
1428064 they knocked down their shots and really made us work for the game it was actually a good game for us and we knew from the jump that theyd come out really physical you can make whatever you want from it were still growing well get better as each game goes on
1428065 ive been preparing for this role my whole life i think in some ways

1428077 the benefit of screening at this time is uncertain and if there is a benefit its likely to be small
1428078 and on the other side the risks are large and dramatic
1428079 we felt with sufficient certainty that your risk of being harmed exceeded your potential benefits starting at age 75
1428080 there is this idea that more is always better and if a test is available we should use it
1428081 a lot of times were doing more harm than good
1428082 its a disservice to patients a lot of men die from prostate cancer and theres just an overwhelming amount of evidence that screening saves lives

1428087 worse it sucks tolls from south florida residents and commercial vehicles while promising to keep the money here we know this is not going to happen the revenues will be diverted elsewhere doesnt charlie realize that these folks expect a profit and that it will come out of our pockets
1428088 all commissioners and legislators in south florida must join together not withstanding political affiliation to protect their constituents from having their toll pockets picked for private gain
1428089 and its part of charlie crists plan to make our roads toll roads and lease them off this is just the first of many

1428097 the e mail seen by ars technica acknowledges mobilemes flaws and what could have been done to better handle the launch in addition to needing more time and testing jobs believes that apple should have rolled mobilemes services out slowly instead of launching it as a monolithic service for example over the air iphone syncing could have gone up initially then web apps one by one mail calendar etc
1428098 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1428099 the mobileme launch clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about internet services

1428127 hasta cuando el consell que preside francisco camps va a permitir la sangr a econ mica de la ciudad de las artes y las ciencias que lejos de atenuarse se incrementa como un caballo desbocado
1428128 se podr a haber hecho frente a las necesidades sanitarias educativas y de atenci n a los mayores

1428134 en lo que va de a o los datos reflejan que este mercado a pesar de la coyuntura mundial se mantiene con cifras cercanas a las registradas en 2007
1428135 hace prever que el a o se saldar con 174 escalas y 201 000 cruceristas
1428136 ya se duplicaron las escalas con respecto a 2006 pasando de 80 a 155
1428137 estos datos y la llegada de nuevos buques demuestran que la ciudad es cada vez m s demandada por las grandes compa as crucer sticas

1428173 whether i like or not cs is an unstoppable monster itll devour all five of us ripped apart piece by piece and shat back out mangled and stinking
1428174 but it also had an overwhelming feeling of liveliness strangely enough down there that set the tone for writing a less heavy record
1428175 whenever i sing i am only truly happy if she loves me so i feel like im going to explode in a thousand little pieces full of joy
1428176 the same thing with the line in devils song where i say this feels like a nightmare that were all in knowing that you can share your feelings creatively with everyone and make sense of them is like a creative orgasm whenever i sing i feel like a totally different person someone fearless

1428187 another thing i wonder about is is when the apologies should end how far back in history should we go to demand apologies for wrongs
1428188 any apology from the government would just be a media hype to make themselves look like the better person they dont feel sorry for a damn thing

1428192 you can get paid for wire if you get enough of it
1428193 a lot of people think that because you scrappin youve got to be a drug dealer
1428194 i ran into scrapping and its finally like i have a chance to be me
1428195 i was at a dead end job and i was torn mentally and physically you know what im saying even if i got another job man with no education its going to be bullshit you might get three four hundred dollars a week after taxes thats like 250 who can live on that

1428204 the easy stuff is being recycled the hard stuff is getting thrown in the trash still
1428205 its phenomenally energy intensive capital intensive environmentally intensive between recycling metal and digging for it or taking off the side of a mountain theres no comparison
1428206 its unfortunate that theres a stigma placed on these guys
1428207 these guys are hard working individuals performing a valuable function a lot of this metal is lying around as trash and this is the most recycled commodity in the world
1428208 if somebody can show me how youre going to identify stolen metal
1428209 working with me you aint got no temptation to steal
1428210 when most people was working and going to school we was out selling drugs and stealing and beating the shit out of people
1428211 al was a special dude man and i learned from him

1428213 wont take but five minutes and well be back on the road
1428214 yo we got metal waiting for us and you want to check out some dumpster that some scrapping motherfucker said had metal come on man
1428215 i knew a trash truck was going to be here
1428216 theres millions of people in this city man millions and each one have 20 30 pieces of metal in their homes thats a couple million times 30 there will always be scrap
1428217 we look at every case on its merits and there may be a case of the offence involved being of such a low value that we say the public doesnt require a prosecution
1428218 we still see many more overweight patients than underweight but its a challenge
1428219 we have to convince overweight people not to eat as much and underweight people to increase their caloric intake
1428220 its vital women know that pregnancy is no time to be starving yourself
1428221 during the nine months it is in the womb the baby is growing faster than it ever will in later life
1428222 what we expect is that whenever possible women should have a physical before they get pregnant that way they can be evaluated for risk factors such as being overweight or underweight
1428223 being overweight can lead to complications such as diabetes and being underweight can lead to problems such as low birth weight
1428224 mama the 4s are sooo big am i big now

1428244 there is absolutely no case of hunger deaths anywhere in the state
1428245 it is strange how the party which is in power denies there have been any starvation deaths but as soon as they are in opposition they start shouting about hunger deaths
1428246 there has been plenty of drum beating but relatively little by way of effective action
1428247 the extension of the nrega to the whole country just three months from now is one of the biggest organisational challenges any government has ever faced it is also an unprecedented opportunity to build the foundations of a social security system in rural india revive village economies promote social equity and empower rural labourers as things stand however this bold initiative looks like a political stunt shorn of the far reaching preparations that are required to make it a success

1428250 valencio listed off the numbers of unionists murdered in colombia like he was reading a report on the weather channel
1428251 our overwhelming conclusion is that a free trade agreement will not help the colombian people
1428252 colombia continues to be the most dangerous country on earth for trade unions and civil society activists we have also observed that colombia has no juridical framework that permits free collective bargaining
1428253 from what we have learned 95 percent of colombian workers do not have an enforceable collective agreement
1428254 we cannot accept a free trade agreement until this changes
1428255 it is easier to form a paramilitary gang than it is to form a trade union in this country
1428256 trade and investment and will help solidify ongoing efforts by the government of colombia to create a more prosperous equitable and secure democracy
1428257 in colombias current climate increased foreign investment will not lift all boats
1428258 colombia is offering canada an fta because it really wants the u s congress to reconsider its opposition to such a deal
1428259 we are not clear where this legislation will go in canada
1428260 colombia imposes tariffs averaging 11 percent on industrial goods 17 percent on agricultural and 15 to 20 percent on cotton yarns and paper products
1428261 the proposed agreement would benefit companies and workers in a wide range of industries including the automotive sector steel chemicals public infrastructure development oil drilling mining and advanced manufacturing such as mining machinery and equipment
1428262 the fact that they do not even know that a bigger customs union is being planned shows that their ideas have not been solicited
1428263 this is because these smaller members of sacu do not benefit much from the protective function of the external tariff regime because almost all the industries protected by the tariff regime are located in south africa which is the dominant member of sacu the revenue sharing formula is therefore being used to appease the blns countries so that they do not make noise about the skewed distribution of industries within sacu
1428264 the establishment of a broader sadc customs union is bound to impact positively on the blns countries in two important ways first it will enable the blns countries to diversify sources of their imports currently these countries get good proportions of their imports from south africa because of the current protective tariff wall created by the sacu external tariff regime
1428265 we will have access to a bigger market a bigger customs union will bring about stiffer competition among producers of goods and services which in turn will lead to higher productivity and efficiency the scales of production will be in favour of everyone in the region
1428266 sacu led to the integrated and coordinated economic development of its members even though a certain polarisation whereby big businesses are concentrated in south africa took place revenue shared among sacu countries has not just helped those countries fiscally but has given them the chance to develop economically it is up to the political leaders in those countries to use the revenue to develop their countries
1428267 this is the reality of the situation and until there is a bigger union there is no use trying to against thunder however i think this polarisation will end once there is a bigger customs union but sadc countries need to develop the skills of their people and do something about their production capacity to survive the impending competition
1428268 south african products are cheaper than products from smaller sacu countries which have relied on south african products to satisfy their domestic needs it is therefore impossible for products from smaller sacu members to compete with south african products even in their own domestic markets leave alone the south african market
1428269 theoretically a broader regional integration will increase the market and increase prospects for economic growth and development
1428270 the natural trade partners for primary goods producers are industrialized countries and the scope for trade within sadc is limited only south africa and to a lesser extent zimbabwe in sadc can provide adequate manufactured products in addition even in this field the range of products remains limited no competitive supply can be found within the region for numerous branches motor vehicles for instance so the eu will be the boss in this area

1428320 bakit pa sila kumuha ng why did they have to get a consultant that is the p100 million question im just asking questions im not accusing anyone of anything but we need more clarifications
1428321 i am saddened by the argument made by the landbank and quedancor officials that the p5 billion loan arrangement for the anomalous swine program is aboveboard this is regrettable for our country
1428322 something is gravely wrong about this transaction which has greatly prejudiced the filipino people there is also nothing regular or aboveboard about a transaction where by their own admission more than p100 million was paid to various arrangers consultants lawyers and questionable charges in the guise of additional taxes
1428323 first they said quedancors loan was part of wholesale lending to farmers but in the same paragraph they also said the loan from landbank and bdo were meant to support quedancors working capital and not tied to any program
1428324 your guess is as good as anybodys guess may documents in the next hearing which will prove this that p122 million in fees went to onl
1428325 they still have to come to the committee and explain to us whether or not it was wise to enter into such an agreement there are many questions on why a government owned and controlled corporation like quedancor would enter into an agreement like that and why you would need an arranger for a gfi to gfi loan we started out asking whether or not may graft and corruption or whether the funds for the swine program were misspent now the loan itself appears to have a problem
1428326 thats what they have to explain but what im saying is that from the start the deal does not look good if you have to pay p100 million landbank and quedancor should have just made a better arrangement
1428327 it was aboveboard duly approved by the banks approving authorities including the board of directors
1428328 that was supposed to be the secret but anyway i will now have to reveal to you that finally the foreign minister of japan has conceded to my appeals that there should be a complete list of all the provisions of the philippine constitution which prohibit any economic activity only to filipinos or filipino owned corporations at the level of 60 70 or even 100 percent
1428329 at first the senators did not understand the meaning of a conditional concurrence in any event now we will no longer have to debate it so my hopes are high that we will be able to get the two thirds vote that should be about 15 or 16 of 23 senators
1428330 we already had 12 senators and we might even be able at the committee level alone to get the needed votes so that in effect will be anti climactic if we are able to get 15 or 16
1428331 in any event there is no more debate on the constitutionality because the japanese foreign minister has authorized the japan ambassador here to enter into an exchange of notes presumably with secretary alberto romulo of the department of foreign affairs so that all constitutional provisions in our philippine constitution that conflict with jpepa will be deemed to be dominant or superior to any jpepa provision
1428332 it will all go japanese foreign direct investment and increased earnings from exports will all go to other southeast asian countries well be the odd man out and since the constitutional provisions over which i was very adamant for the past year have already been accepted by japan i have no more problem with it as a constitutional law scholar
1428333 with the tro temporary restraining order there will be no more signing therefore no reason for postponement
1428334 there is now a zero zero chance for the elections to be postponed
1428335 its all systems go for armm election come hell or high water
1428336 but as we said we are optimistic that it will not happen but again we are going to be ready for it
1428337 whenever we plan any activity we always plan for the worst case scenario police will also be on guard for the upcoming elections in the same region
1428338 the people there do not recognise the borders they move in and out due to economic opportunities in sabah
1428339 this problem has a very long history and many observations have been made on illegal immigrants the people here know this crisis goes back to the 70s
1428340 i think the focus of those involved in illegal immigration during that time was to ensure there was a change in the demography of sabahs population
1428341 but of course today in the whole of sabah no matter what race or origin or religion the people are now worried over this perennial problem
1428342 the main problem is they do not have identification and without this they cannot go to school so many end up as child labor
1428343 many of these children fend for themselves they do not go to school and lay around in markets and restaurants and some sleep in the market area
1428344 the president has heard the cry of consumers that there should be a close scrutiny of this thing
1428345 if there is evidence of overpricing then the government has every moral and even legal authority to impose them penalties under the law
1428346 the whole point is that the president wants that if there is going to be a reduction in the price of fuel in the international market immediately this must be passed on to the consumer
1428347 other nations are trying to reduce their taxes to make life easier for their people here we dont want to ease the burden on our people
1428348 this means that the government is imposing vat even on taxes it is collecting a tax on tax
1428349 in 2007 these revenues reached only p51 billion while vat collections from electricity use amounted to p10 7 billion this year from january to june we estimated that p21 billion in oil vat was collected
1428350 but what is p9 000 or p10 000 a month these days with prices soaring even in normal times that is not much you cant certainly be called rich with that income
1428351 we hope we can comply with the ercs refund order without securing new loans to finance it
1428352 our forecast is so far we may not need to borrow to finance the refund
1428353 upon the request of the chinese side the president will hold a bilateral meeting with president hu jintao to discuss the current bilateral relations

1428355 beijing olympic games is a great event not only for china but also for asia and the whole world as the host of the 29th olympics china welcomes leaders of all countries to attend the opening ceremony and other events of the beijing olympics
1428356 as asean members are important neighboring countries to china we warmly welcome asean leaders to attend the opening ceremony and other events of the beijing olympics it is our wish that athletes from asean countries would have outstanding performance in the games
1428357 we also hope through the beijing olympic games that the friendship understanding and cooperation between asean and china would be furthered strengthened
1428358 in the past few days the court of appeals has been the subject of comments in the print and broadcast media involving the actuations of some of its members relative to the meralco vs gsis case insinuations and accusations have been made to the prejudice of the institution
1428359 respect the sub judice nature of the case and to refrain from public discussion of the merits of the case
1428360 after the july 4 2008 reorganization there was no basis for justices sabio and vidal of the disbanded special ninth division to break this irca rule and the tradition of transparency by clinging on to the meralco case
1428361 justice sabio should have relinquished when regular chairman justice reyes reported back to work
1428362 with all due respect it would be preferable to assuage the pains and anxiety of the trial bar that the investigation of the court of appeals scandal be conducted by the supreme court itself or by a committee of sitting justices rather than delegating the investigation to a panel of retired justices who in turn will submit their findings to the high court for review and determination akin to a trial by commissioners
1428363 what happened is too heinous alleged bribery and case grabbing there is no substitute perhaps to the high court hearing it first hand
1428364 these three retired justices have the highest reputation in the legal profession but in any event these justices enjoy a very high reputation for probity so i am sure that their findings will be highly authoritative
1428365 i am very happy about this development plus the supreme court has even given them a deadline so that is a signal the sc is sending that under the leadership of chief justice reynato puno it is very serious about the question of corruption in the court of appeals
1428366 as i said yesterday i confirm the expression of some that in the legal profession the court of appeals is notorious for bribery
1428367 id like to think that there is fairness and that the output is going to be a product of fair and honest investigation lets not judge them lets just put the burden on them to come out with a fair and honest investigation we cannot second guess them lets just hope that they will base their decision on sound principle

1428379 ive discovered parks i never knew existed in my own neighbourhood because of geocaching
1428380 ive met new friends through geocaching and even found neighbours who do it
1428381 once you get around 20 metres to the cache you need to look with your eyes not your gps
1428382 in the forest its easier because no one is ever going to find it accidentally but in the city it cant be much bigger than a 35mm film container you have to look in places where the cache can be hidden all year round

1428384 i used to look for hours even in the freezing cold i would have to go back home and e mail the owner just to make sure the cache was still there
1428385 sometimes they come up and ask other times theyll see you lingering at a spot and theyll do the same from across the street looking at what youre doing then we get stuck because im waiting for him to leave so i can put away the cache while hes waiting to see if im doing anything bad
1428386 its not uncommon to get an e mail at night saying theres a new cache in your neighbourhood and when you get there theres already a couple of people looking for it with flashlights
1428387 and i was sitting on top of the cache some people just walked by not sure what to do others gave me money to move out of the way
1428388 by the time we meet a new geocacher theyve bought a handheld gps
1428389 if the software doesnt go off the rails it means youll hit a corner and just stop
1428390 whats startling to us is as we get to a point where we feel weve addressed a specific complaint and a specific issue we identify additional issues

1428412 food allergic individuals need to increase the awareness of their food allergy among the people around them
1428413 this would include not only telling them that they are food allergic but also showing them how to treat them and how to recognize signs of an ongoing reaction
1428414 there are serious issues that need to be addressed in terms of educating these young adults that it is of utmost importance to not only maintain emergency medication but to have it with you at all times

1428427 unexpressed concerns can keep patients from accepting recommended surgeries that may be very beneficial for them
1428428 if patients dont bring up concerns with their orthopaedic surgeon then the opportunity to help is missed for example if a patients unexpressed concern is based on incorrect information a surgeon will be hard pressed to help
1428429 our study also found that many patients do not mention worries about their capacity to meet the demands of surgery especially in the post operative period likely thinking that the surgeon cannot help but orthopaedic surgeons may be able to direct patients to social workers and other professional staff who can
1428430 patients are individuals not the left shoulder in room 2 but sometimes orthopaedic surgeons become so technically focused that we forget to develop that necessary personal relationship
1428431 about 20 to 30 percent of patients who undergo a knee or hip replacement end up having someone else do the surgery because they didnt feel a personal connection was established in that first meeting with the orthopaedic surgeon
1428432 improved communication skills can be learned and even small changes can make a big difference
1428433 this research strongly supports our programs emphasis on specific techniques that allow us to be more empathetic with our patients since the average orthopaedic surgeon sees 160 000 patients during his or her career aaos communicaton skills workshops can have a significant impact on patient care
1428434 is there something else you want to talk about today
1428435 there are potential therapeutic benefits associated with simply allowing for the expression of these concerns
1428436 listening to our patients demonstrates a willingness on the part of the surgeon to engage in a dialogue with patients that supports their decision making
1428437 simply offering some empathy and reassurance can go a long way in easing a patients concerns about surgery
1428438 bear in mind theres an operator in the centre of the ride who watches it going around theres an attendant on the side of the ride who is able to jump on as its moving without any problem
1428439 youve also got the parents to hold their two or three year olds on a horse riding for nothing just for safety precautions

1428449 we had a really good team on board and made no mistakes with tactics or sail handling the boat is fast so we just let her go she loves reaching and she loves a bit of wind that was how she was designed so she is proving what we all knew but had previously no chance to prove
1428450 this is our last proper race and our first major race win and one year on things have changed a lot our plan now is to do some two boat testing with hugo boss its great to be doing a lot more high quality sailing with these boats ecover hugo boss artemis we are very pleased with todays result
1428451 we had lots of wind about 22kts maximum and it was very hectic and certainly no time for rest but it was a good race and devina my celebrity seemed to enjoy it too interestingly we had 30kts of wind on the jp morgan round the island race and this one we had a maximum of 23kts and we went round a minute faster
1428452 it was really great to line up together with all the guys and have the race to ourselves
1428453 now in the run up the vendee globe im offshore until the end of august after cowes week im then going to change my keel qualify the change of keel and then do some two boat testing with mike golding with ecover 3 then in september ill be doing the final touch ups before we head to france in october for the vendee

1428462 americans who want to contribute to their presidential candidate of choice are strictly constrained in giving no more than 2300 per candidate election but the same limits apparently dont apply in practice to foreigners who want to help barack hussein obama get elected although the federal election commission clearly does not agree the brothers edwan monir and hasam hail from rafah ga thats ga as in gaza not georgia as first revealed by the they contributed a whopping 29 521 54 to senator obamas campaign more than 13 times the legal limit that applies to american citizens
1428463 nc state fans have learned the hard way since our amazing run of fantastic point guards ended 17 years ago with the graduation of chris corchiani that there is no substitute for a talented point guard providing key leadership for a college basketball program
1428464 it would be tough to turn down nc state they have been my dream school they already are no 1 for me if they tell me that i can come in and play right away not necessarily getting a starting spot it would be hard to turn them down

1428470 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1428471 either obama is a fool and is blind to what should have been obvious or someone like tony is fine by obamas standards the guy is a dirtball and a dirtball would not be part of my circle certainly not my inner circle i would rather not be elected than associate with someone like rezko
1428472 a strength inside i had never known before hitlers sheer animal confidence and power of will entranced me he sent an electric current through my body

1428474 i have to say barack obama has not had any of those experiences either nor has he ridden in a fighter plane and gotten shot down
1428475 well i dont think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president
1428476 a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day

1428485 my headmaster sent me home last week because i hadnt paid the school fees
1428486 im looking in the computers for copper and iron which i can sell to pay the fees
1428487 chemicals like lead are very dangerous especially for children they affect the brain when it is developing and therefore cause a lower iq when they grow up
1428488 other chemicals we found cause cancer or disrupt your hormone system
1428489 my research shows that about 90 of the computers are just junk they just dont work this is dumping
1428490 about 10 are put to good use the rest go straight to agbobloshie dump site and other dumps around the country where they contaminate ground water surface water the rivers and the streams and they all end up in the sea and thats where we get all the fish
1428491 it wouldnt be how we understand the operation functioning no doubt we can clear up the matter quickly
1428492 my face was pushed into the ground my arm was twisted and i was hit two or three times in the face
1428493 this is utterly unacceptable any time its particularly reprehensible just days before the olympics at a time when china has promised complete media freedom
1428494 fulfill its olympic bid commitments to increase access to information and expand freedom of the press
1428495 the japanese reporters violated the rules of china by forcing their way into a military area the act was not well justified and they should accept the consequences
1428496 i however apologize to the reporters as the top regional public security official for the clash they had with the border policemen
1428497 he hasnt been feeling well in the last few races he had a respiratory crisis caused by allergy

1428500 i know my polish language is very difficult to learn so i wanted to try another difficult one

1428503 this is my first olympics and i didnt know what to expect but its better than i thought
1428504 we all had some breathing problems when we arrived but its gotten better day to day
1428505 i can say the food tastes good and the quality i think its ok for sportsmen
1428506 once i got into the home stretch i was smelling beijing and victory
1428507 the force of the water means you have to fight
1428508 heres how to think about such and such a problem in order to arrive at a good solution
1428509 heres a useful way to think about this class of problems
1428510 i think there will be a certain amount of pressure that we put on ourselves to make sure that we go there and play well
1428511 the better we do the more coverage well get here at home and the more people will start to take notice if we can go there and are able to put some good games together i think people in america will really take notice of that and we will be encouraged by that
1428512 i think the pure magnitude of the olympics in our country puts this event on such a pedestal above everything else
1428513 people in our country maybe dont know about the world cup or the champions league so for people in america competing in the olympics is the most prestigious thing you can do as an athlete
1428514 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1428515 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1428516 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves
1428517 and in total they caused widespread loses by banks retailers and consumers

1428521 bradleys an exciting player and were delighted hes joining saracens
1428522 hes a talented footballer who can control games but he also has a physical edge to his game
1428523 having spoken at length to bradley i know he is looking forward to working with the coaching team at saracens to help in the development of his game and also broaden his rugby knowledge
1428524 he wont be joining us until the conclusion of the currie cup but his arrival will add significant strength in depth to the squad
1428525 i want to emphasise the point that i am not turning my back on the sharks or springbok rugby
1428526 from a team perspective losing brad is a big blow for all of us
1428527 he is an outstanding super 14 player a good guy with great leadership qualities but we are not going to hold him back

1428549 todav a hemos visto estos d as al anterior ministro de justicia hablando de construir nuevas imputaciones para que de juana siguiera en la c rcel pero eso es hacer un flaco favor a la democracia y al estado de derecho
1428550 la democracia y el estado de derecho como m s se fortalecen es con la aplicaci n escrupulosa y rigurosa de la ley y de la normativa vigente en cada momento
1428551 si de juana sigue siendo un terrorista no arrepentido su lugar natural sigue siendo la c rcel
1428552 estamos haciendo m s publicidad y la publicidad fortalece a los movimientos terroristas
1428553 s lo pueden implantar el terror si se habla de ellos
1428554 el error que comete el estado de derecho con la reducci n de la condena y la excarcelaci n es que de juana est consiguiendo una segunda rentabilidad por sus m s de 20 asesinatos

1428559 one half hour show on a dvd doesnt sound like good value especially as most of the clips are available to watch on youtube
1428560 im definitely excited to do it theres no travel involved
1428561 its really exciting very fastpaced its a fight to stay near the front were continually sprinting so it makes for a very very fast race
1428562 therell be some guys that might get some road rash
1428563 at the race at enumclaw had a great huge turnout probably about 500 people over the weekend
1428564 the category i was in had about 60 riders and they all want to stay in the front
1428565 in the higher categories you see a lot more team tactics
1428566 youll see a whole team get their guys in front so youve got to look at the guys with the same jersey the higher categories definitely have a lot more strategy
1428567 it made sense to me that wed train here together
1428568 its been nearly 20 years since bellingham had a rink and thats a shame
1428569 i think a rink would be a great success in bellingham
1428570 we really need one in a town our size skating is a perfect family activity
1428571 we havent had a rink in bellingham since the one at the old national guard armory closed in 1989
1428572 we used to have four rinks in the county and now the only one left is in lynden home of the lynden skating club
1428573 we see wonderful facilities like the sportsplex and the arne hanna aquatic center and we can only wish someone would come along to invest in a roller rink
1428574 it would be a multi functional complex since the national roller sports association sponsor of the nationals in nebraska oversees several roller sports
1428575 if i was a millionaire i would build a rink in a heartbeat
1428576 we have a lot of former national champions in our county
1428577 you have to remember to breathe yet stand straight and hold your gut in while remembering all the steps and set patterns in a routine and keep time to the music its a lot harder than it looks
1428578 thats what happens when youre helping to run the race
1428579 if people can run only one race during the year they look forward to the chuckanut
1428580 in those days there was only one century to consider
1428581 dad has almost always won his chuckanut masters division in the last 10 years
1428582 i was a hurdler at bellingham high school and at western
1428583 and when i got older genevie trained me up as a distance runner she got me in better shape than i had ever been
1428584 but i never had any idea i would become a distance runner or that there would ever be races like the chuckanut foot race
1428585 they still go to meets everywhere and they have all kinds of memorabilia
1428586 ive always thought running people were the nicest people you could find being kind and respectful to one another that helps make events like the chuckanut foot race that much more special
1428587 this is going to be a very special day for running in bellingham
1428588 this is the first time weve had a celebration to end our one week summer camp for girls on the run and were planning to make it an annual event
1428589 well start at 9 a m at the barkley village gazebo and everyone in the area is invited to participate including boys and men
1428590 its a non competitive event and our goal is to celebrate the strength confidence and character in girls and women
1428591 in 2007 girls on the run offered half of our total participants either full or partial scholarships to girls who wouldnt otherwise be able to participate in our program
1428592 there are now more than 160 girls on the run councils across the united states and canada
1428593 the local girls on the run program was founded in 2001 by nancy tupper
1428594 we served 250 girls in whatcom county in the past year in fall spring and summer girls on the run
1428595 i really feel the sense of accomplishment our girls develop carries on in all aspects of their lives
1428596 they learn that inside beauty is more important than whats outside
1428597 one girls mother told me her daughter had never done a 5k before joining girls on the run and now she wants to try triathlons
1428598 we keep the groups small so each girl can receive a lot of individual attention
1428599 some groups meet to run and talk once a week and others meet twice in addition to running we talk about topics such as healthy nutrition and why bullying and gossiping are so harmful
1428600 but my mother told me about a car that was available from the mount vernon fire department and it seemed like it would be cool
1428601 i finished third in my first competition last september and then i won the next competition in may
1428602 thats how i qualified for the all american soap box derby
1428603 but i began to realize that it was a lot like ski racing youre reacting to the quick changes you need to make in a lane
1428604 and thats an important part of the race how you fold yourself into the car
1428605 as the day wore on and adam kept winning i was sitting back and grinning because about halfway through it all adam turned to me and said its ok dad ive got it
1428606 what he meant was that he understood the mechanics and decisions he had to make at that point i just relaxed because adam had it figured out
1428607 theres a lot of tension and everything goes so fast in a small period but its not really scary the trick is just to be as smooth as a you can be you actually have more control in skiing
1428608 mike bourgeois a local 1983 firefighter helped me with the car
1428609 it was originally driven by his daughter megan after it was built for the may 2007 qualifying race
1428610 were getting financial support for our trip from washington alder a timber company mount vernon parks and the mount vernon fire department
1428611 just the spectacle of it all and the thousands of people who will be watching will make it quite an experience
1428612 well learn a lot of the details of whats going on when were racing on saturday
1428613 but i really thought i wanted to play basketball i started for one year at north seattle community college and i played another year in the ibl for the lewis county raptors i still love basketball but my focus is entirely on football now
1428614 i went to the first game last season and told myself i could play
1428615 toby was so good as a rookie he won minor league all america honors
1428616 i call him plastic man with his leaping and athletic ability toby is a serious prospect
1428617 im the one who gave az his nickname the wizard of az when he was at whatcom community college
1428618 now i call him the gazelle it took me a little while to talk the gazelle into coming out for football after i became coach but i remembered how quick he was in his two years at wcc so i just knew i wanted him for our team
1428619 if you put the ball within 14 feet of toby he is probably going to make the catch
1428620 he is making some amazing catches for us his video highlights have to be seen to be believed
1428621 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1428622 people are treating the branches while the problem is in the roots
1428623 heres how you have to modify the vanilla ice cream base when youre making cookie dough to keep the nutrition reasonable
1428624 take the instructions for how to modify the base and actually do them on the base
1428625 if i have both chocolate chips and cookie dough ill need to lower the butterfat content of the vanilla base even more to make the nutrition label not scare people
1428626 how long will it take to make sku j of our product how much will it cost
1428627 well we cant just add j we need to change our core library to get ready for j and update this user control to get ready for j oh and then wed need update this menu and that toolbar and this context menu and this documentation oh yeah and then make sure that we didnt cause a regression of any of the functionality in our existing product h b and then finally we could add j and then test and document it
1428628 why not its just as if i told you to make a version of a car that has an option to not have a gps or a tv or cruise control or rear defrost the auto industry has been doing this for decades why cant you do it is this too much to ask dont get in the way of my next bonus buddy
1428629 into distinct features that overlap in functionality as little as possible
1428630 try your best but keep these overarching goals in mind
1428631 if this subject thingy is equal to this object thingy then do such and such
1428632 what are the bad things that can be caused by how you do think
1428633 furthermore it helps to insulate you from the ramifications of renaming a resource it also lets you use intellisense while writing code and lets you use easily refactoring tools if you want to change the name later
1428634 this method will be modified to the following after rewriting
1428635 get out of the way if something dangerous is nearby
1428636 huge disconnect between the practitioners the guys who get stuff done and the academics who think about how we get things done
1428637 the academics and the practitioners dont talk to each other
1428638 programming languages much like human languages are expressions not just of concepts within them but also the environment in which they were born
1428639 the future is already here its not just not evenly distributed
1428640 there has been an enormous over focus on objects and an under focus on messaging most so called object oriented languages dont really use the looser coupling of messaging but instead use the much tighter
1428641 its really unfortunate that congress left for yet another recess without dealing with pending nominations especially for key officials dealing with energy issues like our nominee for deputy secretary of energy and three nominees to be commissioners of the cftc commodity futures trading commission
1428642 when we purchased the paramount parks including kings island in june of 2006 we believed these parks operated in stronger regional markets when compared with our legacy parks
1428643 this geographic diversification has proven to be beneficial to us thus far
1428644 software architects are there to make sure the project doesnt fail
1428645 i dont know how to deal with the symbol sorry
1428646 a new object oriented language for pattern matching ometa is based on a variant of parsing expression grammars pegs a recognition based foundation for describing syntax which we have extended to handle arbitrary kinds of data we show that ometas general purpose pattern matching provides a natural and convenient way for programmers to implement tokenizers parsers visitors and tree transformers all of which can be extended in interesting ways using familiar object oriented mechanisms this makes ometa particularly well suited as a medium for experimenting with new designs for programming languages and extensions to existing languages
1428647 from the very outset simula was regarded as a system description language
1428648 it should be problem oriented and not computer oriented even if this implies an appreciable increase in the amount of work which has to be done by the computer
1428649 another reason for the de emphasizing the above goal was that we realized that the success of simula would regardless of our insistence on the importance of problem orientation to a large to a large extent depend upon its compile and run time efficiency as a programming language
1428650 both parnas and the simula team point to an important principle decomposition into subunits is necessary before we can understand model and build software components if that decomposition is based on a natural partitioning of the domain the resultant models and software components will be significantly simpler to implement and will almost as a side effect promote other objectives such as operational efficiency and communication elegance if instead decomposition is based on artificial or computer derived abstractions such as memory structures operations or functions as a package of operations the opposite results will accrue
1428651 to make it easier to describe natural systems and simulate them in software even if that meant the computer had to do more work
1428652 simulas class based type system was a huge plus but its run time performance was hopeless the poor runtime characteristics were a function of the language and its implementation the overhead problems were fundamental to simula and could not be remedied the cost arose from several language features and their interactions run time type checking guaranteed initialization of variables concurrency support and garbage collection
1428653 c with classes precursor to c was explicitly designed to allow better organization of programs computation was considered a problem solved by c i was very concerned that improved program structure was not achieved at the expense of run time overhead compared to c
1428654 its disputed whether newton ever observed an apple fall he certainly was never struck by one unless theres secret evidence of fraternity food fights while he was studying in cambridge even if the apple incident took place the telling of the story discounts newtons 20 years of work to explain gravity the feat that earned him the attention of the world
1428655 journalists have always asked me what the crucial idea was or what the singular event was that allowed the web to exist one day when it hadnt before they are frustrated when i tell them there was no eureka moment it was not like the legendary apple falling on newtons head to demonstrate the concept of gravity it was a process of accretion growth by gradual addition
1428656 anyone who was never made a mistake has never tried anything new
1428657 i often thank ibm because they gave me so much motivation to do better

1428660 a plan to consolidate all the pentagons space research under a new civilian agency reporting directly to the secretary of defense it would be called the advanced research projects agency or arpa
1428661 the kind of beyond the cutting edge stuff that the services were willing to do without
1428662 the fig tree is pollinated only by the insect blastophaga grossorun the larva of the insect lives in the ovary of the fig tree and there it gets its food the tree and the insect are thus heavily interdependent the tree cannot reproduce without the insect the insect cannot eat without the tree together they constitute not only a viable but a productive and thriving partnership this cooperative living together in intimate association or even close union of two dissimilar organisms is called symbiosis man computer symbiosis is a subclass of man machine systems there are many man machine systems at present however there are no man computer symbioses the purposes of this paper are to present the concept and hopefully to foster the development of man computer symbiosis by analyzing some problems of interaction between men and computing machines calling attention to applicable principles of man machine engineering and pointing out a few questions to which research answers are needed the hope is that in not too many years human brains and computing machines will be coupled together very tightly and that the resulting partnership will think as no human brain has ever thought and process data in a way not approached by the information handling machines we know today
1428663 getting into a position to think to make a decision to learn something i needed to know
1428664 that the problems of command and control were essentially problems of man computer interaction i thought it was just ridiculous having command and control systems based on batch processing who can direct a battle when hes got to write a program in the middle of a battle
1428665 improbably miraculously through some once in a lifetime alignment of all the right planets arpa was offering him a chance to turn his vision into a reality he could reinvent the whole field of computing he could transform those giant calculating machines into full fledged partners in a human creativity he could create information utilities that spanned the continent he could democratize information by opening up vast libraries of material to instant access by anyone and he could do it all with the pentagons money
1428666 the professional bureaucrats had a history of giving grants to individual people in twenty thousand dollar chunks but lick was talking about millions of dollars and whole teams of people it was as though these folks had encountered this alien creature friendly but strange
1428667 lick realized if this vision was ever going to outlast his tenure at arpa he would somehow have to forge all these groups into a self reinforcing self sustaining community
1428668 to the members and affiliates of the intergalactic computer network
1428669 it is evident that we have among us a collection of individual personal and or organizational aspirations efforts activities and projects
1428670 carrying out any research project or study unless such project or study has a direct and apparent relationship to a specific military function
1428671 in retrospect moreover the mansfield amendment came to be seen as the symbolic watershed for arpa the point at which it started its downhill slide from being a cutting edge agency that was blessedly free to take risks to being an ordinary agency that was cautious and risk averse
1428672 if jack goldman hadnt thrown a tantrum in order to get the business guys to listen they might just have rejected the laser printer itself the one parc bred product that would eventually earn billions for xerox and repay its investment in parc many times over
1428673 it was like going into the graveyard or retirement home before going into the maternity ward you could see that microsoft could do things one hundred times faster literally im not kidding six years from that point we overtook xerox in market valuation
1428674 i think that i found a lot of bright people and got them working in this area i got it moving and it was a fantastic community i guess thats the word it was more than just a collection of bright people it was a thing that organized itself into a community so that there was some competition and some cooperation and it resulted in the emergence of a field
1428675 repeated unweaving and reweaving burden on the programmers that introduces many programming errors into the software and can increase costs disproportionate to the size of the problem
1428676 skilled programmers can write better programmers than they can hire
1428677 steps toward the reinvention of programming a compact and practical model of personal computing as a self exploratorium
1428678 reduce the amount of code needed to make systems by a factor of 100 1000 10 000 or more
1428679 this enormous reduction of scale and effort would constitute a moores law leap in software expressiveness of at least 3 and more like 4 orders of magnitude it would also illuminate programming and possible futures for programming it might not be enough to reach all the way to a reinvention of programming but it might take us far enough up the mountain to a new plateau that would allow the routes to the next qualitative change to be seen more clearly this is the goal and mission of our project
1428680 a very advanced functional programming dialect of basic with closures and lambdas and rails like active records that can be compiled down to vbscript javascript php4 or php5 wasabi is a private in house language written by one of our best developers that is optimized specifically for developing fogbugz the wasabi compiler itself is written in c
1428681 however instead of upgrading to asp net they decided to write their own proprietary language that compiles down to vbscript php javascript
1428682 my argument against wasabi is this when a developer decides the right solution to their problem is a new language you dont have a solution you have an even bigger problem
1428683 do you want to get your program done or do you want to get it right we confuse productivity with getting it done quickly we dont account for all the hours of debugging were doing the wrong accounting
1428684 we can have only the greatest praise for the flight crew the flight attendants who worked to get everyone off the plane safely
1428685 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
1428686 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1428687 we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate

1428691 when confronted with a difficult position a weaker player may calculate for half an hour often looking many moves ahead yet miss the right continuation whereas a grandmaster sees the move immediately without consciously analyzing anything at all
1428692 a common assumption is that the decomposition process is guided by a knowledge representation which is built up with experience and stored in long term memory when such a knowledge representation is not available experts develop plans through a bottom up backward strategy when software designers were asked about strategies they would recommend to an inexperienced programmer working on the same design problem high performers reported twice as many strategies as moderate performers experienced programmers did not necessarily have more plans available but focused on the most salient parts of the plan and flexibly switched between plans in contrast novices preferred a strategy with which plans are implemented in a more linear fashion
1428693 a thinking aloud study showed that high performers needed less time for debugging made fewer errors searched more intensively for problems and showed more information evaluation activity
1428694 professional programmers metacognitive knowledge was much more detailed and more comprehensive than students knowledge for example a professional programmer provided a comment such as the main program is not very well divided the logic has been scattered over different parts of the program the updating paragraph has too much in it the control function of the program should be implemented in one paragraph now the program has much depth in itself and scanning is difficult
1428695 exceptional software designers showed superior communication skills in fact much of the exceptional designers design work was accomplished while interacting with other team members high performers spent a lot of time educating other team members about the application domain and its mapping into computational structures they found that individual performance of software developers is facilitated significantly by a 15 minute talk with a senior designer about their task these results hold for complex tasks not just for simple ones indicating that high task complexity makes it more necessary and more valuable for the programmer to communicate with a more senior person
1428696 i think there is great potential it all depends on how efficient you make your chunking algorithm moreover you have to be careful
1428697 google uses bayesian filtering the way microsoft uses the if statement
1428698 which is much easier to chunk than the roughly equivalent
1428699 youre just calling chunks what are called design patterns or even micropatterns
1428700 if the basic concepts arent so easy that you dont even have to think about them youre not going to get the big concepts you see if you cant whiz through the easy stuff at 100 m p h youre never gonna get the advanced stuff
1428701 ericssons primary finding is that rather than mere experience or even raw talent it is dedicated slogging generally solitary exertion repeatedly practicing the
1428702 all skaters spent considerably more time practicing jumps that already existed in their repertoire and less time on jumps they were attempting to learn
1428703 not because they are easy but because they are hard
1428704 you hate the kind that lead to failure and hair pulling and fist pounding
1428705 the most contentious claim made by dr ericsson is that practice alone not natural talent makes for a record breaking performance innate capacities have very little to do with becoming a champion said his colleague dr charness whats key is
1428706 when we train olympic weight lifters we find we often have to throttle back the total time they work out
1428707 otherwise you find a tremendous drop in mood and a jump in irritability fatigue and apathy
1428708 you hate the kind that lead to failure and hair pulling and fist pounding
1428709 if you think youre at a 7 youre really at a 3 maximum
1428710 and it should never get easier if it does you are coasting not improving
1428711 would be better off trying to learn from more experienced programmers
1428712 under senator mccains plan the oil companies get billions more we dont pay any less at the pump and we stay in the same cycle of dependence on oil that got us into this crisis
1428713 the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1428714 unfortunately in this election senator mccain has proposed an energy plan thats nothing but four years more of the same
1428715 senator obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america
1428716 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1428717 while americans are hurting barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1428718 it underscores that barack obama isnt being straightforward with voters and has the bad judgment americans cant afford right now
1428719 i will be 70 in 2012 ive not made any commitment
1428720 i would not in any way shape or form try and commit myself to something that is four years ahead

1428726 well im just saying this as an option and not
1428727 a change of that magnitude is more than we have seen in 20 million years
1428728 if we had wanted to destroy as much of life on earth as possible there would have been no better way of doing it than to dig up and burn as much fossil hydrocarbon as we possible could
1428729 the higher cost of crude oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price of gasoline and other refined products
1428730 as a result our downstream operations incurred a loss in the second quarter with most of the loss taking place in the united states
1428731 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
1428732 were probably holding around 3 000 people you know bagram air field diego garcia guant namo 16 camps throughout iraq
1428733 theyre behind bars weve got them on diego garcia in bagram air field in guant namo
1428734 we have received concurring confirmations that united states agencies have used diego garcia which is the international legal responsibility of the uk in the processing of high value detainees
1428735 he had received credible evidence from well placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on diego garcia between 2002 and 2003
1428736 the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
1428737 the u s may also have kept prisoners on ships within diego garcias territorial waters a contention the u s has long denied
1428738 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
1428739 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
1428740 is a violation of uk law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
1428741 a u s plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the u s facility in diego garcia the detainees did not leave the plane and the u s government has assured us that no u s detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
1428742 neither of the two detainees carried aboard the rendition flights that refuelled at diego garcia was ever part of the cias high value terrorist interrogation program
1428743 the united states government confirmed that with the exception of two cases related to diego garcia in 2002 there have been no other instances in which u s intelligence flights landed in the united kingdom our overseas territories or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 september 2001
1428744 intentionally failed to ask the right questions of the u s and accepted implausible u s assurances at face value
1428745 this remains a transatlantic cover up of epic proportions while the british government seems content to accept whatever nonsense it is fed by its u s allies the sordid truth about diego garcias central role in the unjust rendition and detention of prisoners in the so called war on terror cannot be hidden forever
1428746 it is deplorable that previous u s assurances about rendition flights have turned out to be false the failure of the united states administration to tell the truth resulted in the uk government inadvertently misleading our select committee and the house of commons we intend to examine further the extent of uk supervision of u s activities on diego garcia including all flights and ships serviced from diego garcia
1428747 responsible for the 9 11 operation from a to z
1428748 diego garcia is an obvious place for a secret facility they want somewhere thats difficult to escape from difficult to attack not visible to prying eyes and where a lot of other activity is going on diego garcia is ideal
1428749 this indictment proves that the government was never interested in any information that dr al arian has on the iiit i e the international institute of islamic thought matter
1428750 they have indicted him despite the fact that the prosecutors admitted that he is a minor witness in the iiit investigation and he has already given two detailed statements under oath to the government and offered to take a polygraph examination to prove that he has given true information about his knowledge of iiit dr al arian has addressed every document cited by the government as the reason for his being called before the grand jury he has shown that he has no incriminating information to offer against either iiit or its officers

1428753 after charles lindberghs baby was abducted over 200 people walked into police stations and said they were the kidnapper
1428754 the false selling of the iraq war we were railroaded into an unnecessary war
1428755 no president of the united states should employ distortion of truth to take the nation to war
1428756 the bush administration convinced a substantial majority of americans before the war that saddam hussein was somehow linked to 9 11 inexcusably selling the false iraq al qaeda claim to americans
1428757 the president and his top advisers did not allow the american people or even congress to have the information necessary to make reasoned judgments of their own its obvious that the bush administration misled americans about mr husseins weapons and his terrorist connections
1428758 any device capable of storing information in digital or analog form

1428760 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgen of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
1428761 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
1428762 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
1428763 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
1428764 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
1428765 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed
1428766 the opportunity for the university to promote its programs at no cost to the school provides exceptional benefit to both the campus and the community
1428767 it would cost thousands of dollars to promote campus events and messages in a high traffic location such as highway 50
1428768 theyre a great medium for sending out safety messages as well as an essential means of possibly reuniting abducted children with their families
1428769 unsurprisingly the favored method to connect is fiber to the premises as embodied by the verizon fios service
1428770 the fast fiber hookup received an 8 6 for an overall score the best rating of all the broadband options

1428796 if we are not going to receive a clear response a clear message from them we are going to have no choice but to pursue additional measures
1428797 so first we will see what happens with the rest of the day that is left in europe and then they will have their call tomorrow we will see where we go from there

1428805 last week i spent another night riding with one of our irondequoit police officers and i know firsthand the importance of providing the men and women who are on the front line keeping our community safe with the proper equipment
1428806 senator alesi understands this need and on behalf of the town our police department and our residents i am grateful for his support
1428807 there is nothing more gratifying than securing these funds to ensure the lives of our first responders are protected so they can continue to protect others

1428857 a bad experience on muni on the way to work can trickle down all day to employers co workers and customers i personally believe that munis failure is degrading the quality of life for all san franciscans and our guests the foreign tourists who jammed the system all summer while traveling to take advantage of the weak dollar did the chamber of commerce collect data about their transit experience

1428970 but when dealing with students especially many who will become future rabbis talmidim and thus will refer back to him as an authority in my opinion there is no such leeway for off the cuff remarks
1428971 think of this post as a serious question regarding ase lecha rav what compels a person to revere a particular rabbi how is such reverence expressed or imposed on other people and to what extent is someones reverence an excuse for abdicating critical thought or a motivation for cognitive dissonance
1428972 in the charedi definition but for the modern orthodox world there are obvious differences between them of which people should be aware
1428973 the singling out here and now is for a few reasons aside from the immediate relevance
1428974 what was offensive about his comments regarding the edah conference is that he claims that only certain people with a cognizance of
1428975 this is overtly contrary to torah and as linked in the post is an idea not of torah origin
1428976 this is overtly contrary to torah and as linked in the post is an idea not of torah origin
1428977 that is what the talmud says sheal avicha veyagedcha they will be able to tell you what the spirit of the law is
1428978 the belief that ufos were present at the base probably started when alleged former employee bob lazar came forward in 1989 claiming hed seen a ufo at an area within the base called s 4
1428979 lazar claimed that s 4 was used to back engineer alien technology according to lazar there were nine ufos in the hanger it was his job to investigate the propulsion system of the craft
1428980 was this a case of lazar lying or the us military removing all traces of him being on the base once he went public with his story
1428981 dreamland a documentary from the mid 90s included an interview with a 71 year old mechanical engineer who claimed to be a former employee at area 51 during the 1950s
1428982 he claims he worked on a flying disc simulator built to train us pilots based on a disc originating from a crashed extraterrestrial craft during his career at area 51 he claimed to have worked with an extraterrestrial being whose name was j rod described as a telepathic translator
1428983 i just think its down to testing secretive aircraft which the american government dont want the rest of the world to see the american government have probably let the alien conspiracy theories go a little further so the public can be a bit more imaginative which allows them to get along with their work without hassle
1428984 there are undoubtedly ufos theres no question about that theres too many bits of video tape film too many reliable witnesses too many pilots who have seen them for them to be denied and say they are irrational
1428985 the idea that the governments of the world are all involved in a huge cover up regarding extraterrestrial visitation hardly stands up to a nanoseconds critical scrutiny
1428986 presumably the aliens wouldnt choose to only crash their saucers having travelled successfully across the galaxy conveniently near to area 51
1428987 any anti american national leader in the word would be in a position to blow the whistle at any time the conspiracy theory is complete nonsense
1428988 for some the truth is very mundane and quite boring

1429000 we believe this was caused by mass spam e mails mentioning the just say no deal network of blogs which in turn caused our system to classify the blog addresses mentioned in the e mails as spam
1429001 we have restored posting rights to the affected blogs and it is very important to us that blogger remain a tool for political debate and free expression
1429002 malicious intentions at all its just that spammers can literally overrun a service if youre not careful so their defenses have become overzealous
1429003 we always have human review before turning off an active blog
1429004 people invest so much time into their blogs to treat it with anything less than the utmost respect is criminal

1429006 i believe that i have been road tested and trialed and i have found myself willing
1429007 and i could do for sen mccain what i did for president bushs father put him over the top with the republican party baseline
1429008 and i can do it all over again im rested and ready and set to rip into this campaign like a tissue paper tiger
1429009 if we can deposit men on mars as we have been doing we can get a republican elected president this year and im just the astronaut to help sen mccain win the white house
1429010 greetings my friend we are all interested in the future for that is where you and i are going to spend the rest of our lives and remember my friend future events such as these will affect you in the future
1429011 sen mccain what would you do to guarantee americans more jobs
1429012 ah ah ah ah ah stare at camera confused for thirty seconds
1429013 sen mccain do you think supporters of your opponent have questioned your military service
1429014 fuck all of these people i can chew em up and eat em for breakfast im a godamned war hero and nobody better say different or ill toss em in gitmo to rot i dont care what the law says president mccain doesnt eat shit from anybody you talk out of line and ill have you disappeared you little jerks
1429015 they call him flipper flipper he flops faster than lightning no one you see changes quicker than he
1429016 read my lips candidate no new taxes no matter what
1429017 there is nothing thats off the table i have my positions and ill articulate them but nothings off the table
1429018 i think the worst thing that could happen to america in these very tough economic times is to raise someones taxes
1429019 the board has expressed its support for rick wagoner and the gm management team on several occasions and that has not changed
1429020 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1429021 consumers companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information

1429027 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
1429028 have you seen the new commercial the mccain campaign compares barack obama to britney spears and paris hilton
1429029 and today the obama campaign released an ad comparing john mccain to zsa zsa gabor and bea arthur
1429030 senses a chink in obamas armor following the democrats european tour which did not appear to give obama a noticeable bounce in the polls despite drawing a crowd of 200 000 in berlin
1429031 it is a strategy that carries some risks with americans weary of partisan sniping
1429032 beyond this one ad other overriding concerns im hearing is that mccain has perhaps gone too negative and its taking away from his above the fray campaign that he has said that he wants to run
1429033 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
1429034 remarks put mr obamas campaign in a delicate position his campaign gingerly tried to tamp down the issue saying he did not believe that mr mccain had tried to use race as an issue
1429035 was the latest spike in a contest thats grown increasingly negative despite pledges by both obama and mccain to run aboveboard campaigns
1429036 as both maneuver for advantage and polls show the race competitive three months before the election
1429037 why sweetie arent you familiar with the oddly melancholy fat giant
1429038 lets trust that any real world kid with half an upbringing understands that what goes on in this show and in its advertisements is a cartoon extreme meant to entertain rather than instruct
1429039 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1429040 if there is a subtle shift in the risk assessment it is that while acknowledging the downside risks to growth it notes the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1429041 1 in 8 single births began as a twin pregnancy
1429042 did you see the outcome of the monthly challenger job report that usually is a good indicator of the jobs jamboree
1429043 a situation that looked at first like it could be confined to the housing industry really has taken a wide swath across the country with job losses
1429044 its not just construction jobs either and i believe these job losses are just gaining momentum unfortunately by the fourth quarter we could be looking at a 6 unemployment rate ugh
1429045 dont know much about history dont know much biology dont know much about a science book dont know much about the french i took but i do know that job losses cause recessions and if theyre bad enough they could cause depressions old sam cooke never thought his song would be used to make fun of dollar bulls buying dollars in the face of huge job losses
1429046 with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing

1429056 im delighted to have signed ive been with these players for two years now and the spirit is fantastic
1429057 the manager harry redknapp is the main man and i love the fans they are the best in the league like a 12th man in the team
1429058 and i want to score more goals than last season only four in the premier league and more like my first season here 12
1429059 above all i want to give 100 per cent all the time
1429060 he said the winds were between 88 and 120 miles per hour to have done the damage weve seen
1429061 the ability to use these funds for public safety initiatives can also help with our transportation needs
1429062 we wanted it to be in the police so if we do have a proposal they would be able to consider it

1429064 i havent heard any complaints with many of the ordinance violations its easier for people to come to the village on a monday night than to the courthouse in the middle of the day
1429065 one of the benefits is our managers dont have to go to the cook county courthouse anymore
1429066 both companies have stated that the current economic climate is affecting marketing budgets in all industries and that market conditions had changed during the course of the agreements

1429072 the friends of the louvre is a milieu that is both cultured and demanding and it easily gets into a bad mood
1429073 as one of the biggest museums in the world the louvre cannot escape the consequences of globalization
1429074 theyll present all the facts and the grand jury will decide if any charges are appropriate
1429075 the majority of our investigation focused on the accident investigation and basically how the whole thing transpired in terms of the accident the post accident investigation everything
1429076 thats certainly one of the things that probably will be considered by the grand jury his actions following the accident itself
1429077 he is represented by an attorney so therefore were not interviewing him at this point in time
1429078 the baby has gained a small amount of weight but is still battling for her life
1429079 all alexis recalls is her car stalling out and steering over to the left shoulder of the road
1429080 she put her flashers on and some other vehicles were able to pass by but nicholas joseph was not able to do that for some reason and rear ended her car
1429081 were very interested in where he was coming from and what he had been doing and whether he was under the influence of anything
1429082 and that would obviously have affected his reaction time and whether he could have avoided striking alexis vehicle in the first place
1429083 the caribbean is a perennial favorite spot for tourists during the winter months and delta is making it easier and more convenient for customers to reach their preferred beach destination
1429084 driving in here it was nice to sort of see where everything was and bring back a few memories
1429085 its always good to come back somewhere where youve played well in the past and you have good memories from
1429086 its amazing that a european has not won in such a long time when you consider the strength of european golf especially over the last few years
1429087 the likes of nick faldo and seve ballesteros and woosie ian woosnam and bernhard langer nd sam torrance and people like that and monty colin montgomerie monty had a good chance at a couple and amazing that none of us would win
1429088 im playing all right at the moment and i hope to carry that form through
1429089 this will be a good place to start off winning im carrying a lot of confidence through from last week
1429090 you look at the bridgestone thing vijay he doesnt play well for three months and he wins one and he starts playing well again
1429091 people may hate it belle lettrists may orchestrate public disembowelments of all concerned
1429092 maybe it is good that the residents learn that approach early on because it seems that most docs are becoming shift workers
1429093 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
1429094 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence

1429097 requiring larger preapproval databases could be a cost effective means of reducing adverse events in post approval populations
1429098 mating it with the latest process control information and communications systems
1429099 the next step beyond fair trade helping farmers by transferring knowledge of how to grow and ferment better beans so they can escape commodity production to become premium producers
1429100 while bureaucrats are arguing and stalling over minutia the tax paying people of texas are taking it in the teeth
1429101 the negative impact that our open borders have on public health on our crime rates and on our states budget are real and the more we delay enacting solutions the more we are forcing the citizens to pay not just in dollars but in peace of mind
1429102 the number one priority for all levels of government should be the safety of our citizens
1429103 surely the commission is able to see that they have a duty to place the health and safety of the people of texas over the perceived and hypothetical risks to the population of fish in a two acre area
1429104 the plaintiffs argument turns the first amendment on its head
1429105 their reasoning would condemn any law that prevents discrimination against religion by expressly protecting the right of students to pray including numerous federal and state laws that protect students against religious hostility
1429106 the state of texas will work diligently to defend the law and uphold the district courts decision which ruled that texas moment of silence statute is entirely constitutional
1429107 with shannon graceys growth across texas the ability to communicate with our clients lawyers and other parties of interest quickly and in multiple formats print video internet has become critical to our business
1429108 liesls demonstrated talent creativity and experience in multi media communications brings us the top notch professional that shannon gracey needs to direct all of this important process
1429109 legal communications is completely different from anything i have ever done
1429110 but i am not afraid to get my hands dirty and my feet wet working for such an established and respected firm shannon gracey exemplifies the best of texas and i couldnt be prouder to be a part of this team
1429111 drastic action that attracts a crowd or affects public order
1429112 foreign reporters will no longer be prohibited from filming on tiananmen square
1429113 this kind of thing is good news if it is enforced
1429114 what weve seen in the past is that the central government has instituted rule changes and then when it comes for them to be implemented on the ground local authorities dont follow through
1429115 instead of preventing things from going wrong the focus will now be on how to deal with things when they go wrong
1429116 almost all our players play in europe so it would be much easier for us to join the six nations
1429117 but we are also in the southern hemisphere and it would be great to join the tri nations
1429118 but then we would never get a holiday because we would be playing tri nations when our clubs are on holiday and we would never get a break our clubs would not be happy and in this professional era they are our bosses it is a really difficult decision
1429119 the world cup was a really big thing for us but it is impossible to keep at that level if we only play six tests per year
1429120 ti amo molto di piu di quanto avessi fatto nel 2004

1429130 there are definite regional pockets of low and high cost medicare spending
1429131 there may be a silver lining in this for some texas communities
1429132 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1429133 this transformation will be costly and given the fiscal disaster we will inherit from the last administration it will likely require us to defer some other priorities
1429134 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1429135 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1429136 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1429137 like george bush and dick cheney before him he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than 1 million from big oil just last month
1429138 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1429139 it was sen obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1429140 a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families a thousand dollar rebate

1429147 reforma del c digo de procedimiento penal para evitar las excarcelaciones y tambi n para limitar este uso de pulseras
1429148 imag nense c mo me cay que se haya dejado en libertad a una persona con esos antecedentes pero en el marco de la independencia de los poderes en este caso es el consejo de la magistratura quien debe analizar el pedido de juicio pol tico
1429149 lo que s tengo claro es que hay que ir a fondo en la investigaci n de por qu se lleg a esta situaci n y ya he instruido al ministro de justicia en este tema
1429150 la reforma del c digo de procedimiento penal para evitar las excarcelaciones y tambi n para limitar este uso de pulseras
1429151 en primer lugar se ha removido a personal del servicio penitenciario y se abri la instancia de juicio pol tico y por otro que estos mecanismos por las pulseras queden restringidos a casos de gravedad de salud o mujeres embarazadas
1429152 esta es una situaci n que ven a de otra gesti n no la cuestiono es un tema que en el marco de la reforma de la justicia estamos cambiando

1429162 d nde surge atento a sus manifestaciones ante distintos medios de comunicaci n que la sobreventa de pasajes de la empresa alcanzar a los us 140 millones
1429163 sin embargo con fecha 7 4 08 el poder ejecutivo a trav s del decreto 565 08 vet el art culo 32 que precisamente habilitaba a multar a las compa as a reas por sobreventa de pasajes ese art culo fue el nico veto a la nueva ley esta decisi n result funcional a la venta de acciones beneficiando la pol tica de sobreventa de pasajes aplicada por aerol neas argentinas
1429164 en el marco de estas negociaciones aerol neas argentinas cont con el aval para sobrevender pasajes
1429165 la defensor a del pueblo de la naci n viene efectuando desde hace bastante tiempo denuncias sistem ticas por la sobreventa de pasajes a reos
1429166 es por ello que tanto el ministro de planificaci n como el secretario de transporte de la naci n ricrado jaime tuvieron informaci n oportuna y actualizada sobre el mecanismo de sobreventa entre otros tantos perjuicios que padec an y siguen padeciendo los usuarios del transporte
1429167 es incomprensible que las nuevas autoridades como el nuevo secretario de agricultura y el jefe de gabinete no hayan tenido una comunicaci n con el sector no lo entendemos

1429199 the events of the last five weeks highlight the profound importance of dns to the proper functioning of the internet and the critical role nominum plays in protecting it
1429200 our customers around the world demonstrated an extraordinary commitment and ability to address this problem quickly and efficiently their confidence in nominum built on a long history of stable and predictable software releases allowed them to upgrade rapidly without disrupting their networks or operations
1429201 nominum has a strong track record of delivering software that works the first time

1429203 nominum has done its customers and the internet a great service by working so closely with me the carriers and the rest of the dns community on this common threat to the internet and nominum has delivered on the trust placed in it by its customers
1429204 to know that over a hundred and twenty million users are safe within such a short time after the vulnerability was discovered is excellent and nominums customers set a great example for others to follow

1429223 this team is very close and we expect to surprise some people
1429224 but one thing ive learned is that in this league when you are holding on a lead in the fourth quarter you have to be able to run some clock and keep your defense rested
1429225 i was doing my film study during the spring and when david was here i might have had one page of notes on things i wanted to ask him about because we knew each others thoughts we had worked together a long time
1429226 when i watched daves group i took down about six pages of notes of things that caught my attention im excited about this guy and what he is bringing to the table
1429227 i hated that i couldnt be out there helping we are going to find ways to get our opponent off the field
1429228 it was one of the most gratifying seasons ive ever had in coaching
1429229 a lot of people gave up on us but our guys just kept playing they deserve the credit

1429233 you are an intelligent man you were a senior police officer
1429234 you were no doubt thoroughly familiar with the sort of harm this type of offence could inflict
1429235 you had an obsession of sexually offending against girls with a particular propensity towards incest
1429236 my team were able to recover a contact list and chat logs of alexander discussing his fascination for incestuous sexual activity especially that between a father and daughter
1429237 he was able to do this whilst sharing obscene images of this nature with other like minded individuals
1429238 his actions have had a lasting effect on his daughter who will undoubtedly live with this for the rest of her life
1429239 i had my hands in my pocket standing totally off my guard the next minute this headbutt came from nowhere and struck me right on the lip i had to get two stitches
1429240 it made it worse for me knowing he was a serving police officer a trusted person by the public
1429241 really the moneys not the matter here its the fact the guy can get off with a fiscal fine hes got no criminal record whatsoever and hes back with his police uniform on the next day
1429242 parliament decided that in situations like that the procurator fiscal could look at it take a decision about what the average fine would be and present it to the justice court which is where that case would have gone
1429243 we took the decision that under new provisions it would be appropriate for compensation to be paid to mr cantwell of 250 quickly and efficiently
1429244 the difficulty seems to be the level of crime that is now being diverted from prosecution is causing great concern in particular the level of violent crime which is no longer being prosecuted
1429245 justice has to be available for everyone the accused and victims of crime there has to be a balance struck between those two
1429246 its really a matter for public attention and public debate to decide on how we should deal with violent offenders or offenders of a level above the most minimal offence
1429247 the allegations made in the times article are simply not true there was no deal never mind a deal preventing the uk military from entering basra
1429248 i have the greatest confidence in the judgement of uk military commanders in iraq and i would never seek to constrain their ability to make decisions
1429249 britain would release around 60 militia prisoners and stop patrolling inside the city in return the mehdi army agreed not to attack the british as they withdrew to the airport
1429250 lives were saved but basra was effectively abandoned now questions are being asked about just how far this deal tied british commanders hands during this years battle for basra
1429251 no secret deal or accommodation with the militias kept us out of the city
1429252 the only limit placed on the profile of our support was mr malikis rightful concern that the iraqi security forces be seen by the people of basrah to be those enforcing the rule of law in the city
1429253 had no bearing on the decision to go to the city
1429254 exactly under what circumstances the negotiations took place and whether or not they tied the hands of the british army
1429255 what would be unacceptable is if our troops were under effective political orders not to take risks because potential loss of life would be politically unacceptable
1429256 when the iraqi army needed help our forces should have been free to give that help as required
1429257 i am honored to be the superintendent of the mobile county public school system

1429268 this doesnt say much however as the reliability of the test results has always been too low to provide accurate comparisons between schools
1429269 while the reliability of the key stage 2 results has to be treated with a massive pinch of salt there is no evidence of a decline in standards despite this years chaos primary schools are doing well
1429270 should have taken the opportunity to ask lord sutherland to conduct a fundamental review of the entire flawed testing system
1429271 it is very difficult to speculate on what will happen to house prices over the next year or so

1429273 it is a welcome initiative and shows that ministers appreciate the problems the current housing market situation is causing people looking to buy and sell properties and the impact it is having on the wider economy
1429274 the government shouldnt be trying to bribe people into buying houses in a falling market
1429275 with the economy grinding to a halt we are already likely to see a shortfall in taxation suspending stamp duty even on a temporary basis will only make this situation worse
1429276 bradley is a very exciting player and were delighted that he is joining saracens hes a talented footballer who can control games but he also has a physical edge to his game as his powerful displays for the sharks in their super 14 and currie cup campaigns have shown

1429279 ive tried to do everything i can in order to be a valuable asset for the company and army the first few months into our deployment i emphasized to soldiers that the easiest way to be productive is to improve your foxhole
1429280 so we spent a lot of effort renovating our office and doing carpentry work for the company but then we realized how much more of a benefit we could be if our work was more related to our specific skill set nothing says we cant fix printers
1429281 people enjoy doing what they are trained to do we may not be tearing apart army radios but were still burying our noses in wiring diagrams with the amount of office equipment weve fixed so far im confident our efforts are making a difference

1429311 w hen iraq finally admitted having these weapons in 1995 the quantities were vast less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax a little bit about this amount this is just about the amount of a teaspoon less than a teaspoon full of dry anthrax in an envelope shutdown the united states senate in the fall of 2001 this forced several hundred people to undergo emergency medical treatment and killed two postal workers just from an amount just about this quantity that was inside of an envelope
1429312 the anthrax in the tainted letter sent to senate majority leader tom daschle was laced with bentonite
1429313 a troubling chemical additive that authorities consider their first significant clue yet
1429314 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
1429315 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
1429316 the anthrax found in a letter to senator daschle is nearly identical to samples they recovered in iraq in 1994

1429709 studying the courts decision and will respond to mr marris contentions
1429710 this decision means the president can pick up any person in the country citizen or legal resident and lock them up for years without the most basic safeguard in the constitution the right to a criminal trial
1429711 was lawfully present in the u s and then arrested and held here as opposed to being a noncitizen captured in a foreign land
1429712 this consideration makes his case more difficult even in the eyes of relatively conservative jurists
1429713 because he was not captured on a foreign battlefield or foreign soil
1429714 is akin to a judicial declaration that congress and the executive may fight only the last war
1429715 this does not mean that al marri or similarly situated american citizens would have to be freed
1429716 like others accused of terrorist activity in this country from the oklahoma city bombers to the convicted september 11th conspirator zacarias moussaoui they could be tried on criminal charges and if convicted punished severely but the government would not be able to subject them to indefinite military detention

1429737 the goal of the organization is to have a competent and professional group of armed volunteers ready to respond to a threat at a moments notice in any area where jews reside
1429738 we do not carry out demonstrations or political activity of any kind as we have no political agenda our agenda is to protect jews wherever and whenever necessary and by any means needed
1429739 felt a false sense of security in the united states
1429740 because historically there has been less anti semitism than in other countries but there have been incidents neo nazi terrorist attacks arab terrorist attacks jews have to be vigilant
1429741 the threat is not from the american people or government
1429742 terrorist sleeper cells that want to target jews these people are very dangerous and the fbi issues warnings against them very often
1429743 the average american is friendly to jews but were worried about those individuals on the periphery of society
1429744 we realized there is a need for this kind of organization and as israeli combat veterans living in the us we have the skills and ability to respond to this
1429745 we believe all jews in the us must be legally armed and trained
1429746 and towards this goal we hold paramilitary training camps to train and equip jewish american youth
1429747 are 100 legal and in compliance with all federal state and local laws
1429748 we strongly believe in the constitutional right to bear arms and we express this right to its fullest
1429749 well connected with the new york police and fire departments
1429750 all members of the law enforcement community to join in our life saving activities
1429751 we are all legally armed and carry radios and cellphones
1429752 as we need to be constantly ready to respond to any incident
1429753 know your rights and learn how every american can and must be legally armed and how to express the second amendment
1429754 we wouldnt have a problem with non jews coming either
1429755 why do i have deleted items as the most prominent folder in my all mail folders section
1429756 the goal of the zionist movement is to establish a state in palestine which would become a base for ruling the entire world its other goals are to destroy the religions it opposes particularly islam to corrupt values and morality to spread permissiveness and sex and to generate moral decline
1429757 they have come up with many means to achieve this such as inventing philosophical theories that destroy religion and morality
1429758 jean paul sartre founder of existentialism which is based on atheism was a famous french jew
1429759 there are also theories that were invented by non jews but they disseminate them knowing that they are scientifically false such as the theory of darwin darwin was not jewish but they exploited his theory even though new darwinist theories have appeared they spread the original theory because the concept of survival of the fittest serves their colonialist needs
1429760 yes it serves the goals of global jewry in addition they established destructive movements to fight religion and morality to corrupt the leaders throughout the world and to break down social relations among nations
1429761 this was led by global freemasonry which was founded by three prominent jews the first of whom was herod this is a long well known story the role of the jews in creating the masonic movement the freemason movement used various methods to bring the political philosophical and literary leaders worldwide to their knees i remember the names of arab leaders some are dead and others are still alive who joined the masonic movement they were brought down there were even palestinians among them
1429762 we see this clearly in the u s elections both democrats and republicans compete to please the state of the jews thats why when a democrat comes to occupied palestine he puts on a religious skullcap goes to the western wall bangs his head against the wall and says your philosophy and the need to please you is now inside my head they all compete with one another but the jews maintain a balance and they always prefer the christian zionists
1429763 if a democrat comes to power like bill clinton who served them well in oslo and elsewhere and almost served them in the second camp david but then made statements they didnt like what did zionism do
1429764 clinton left the white house but there are thousands of pages documenting his sexual depravity because he had sex in the white house i read a report that clinton used to call arab leaders and talk to them while she was having sex with him
1429765 these things are documented but the arabs dont read them
1429766 even if you take all of alaska into account its a pretty small marketplace

1429782 this is a complicated long term plan and the legislature wants to continue to exercise its oversight every step of the way
1429783 my main criticism is that the plan was not nearly detailed enough the discussions that went on between arb staff and other stakeholders were on a much more detailed level than what was reflected in the plan

1429831 this is only one account of how ziggy odyssey the man of mumbo died and it does not include a giant pancake or any other such silliness what strangeness compels a man to babble such nonsense i cannot say he was a reckless fool who often confused the lines of adventure and idiocy i knew him well but he was driving much too fast and when the car flew off the road it did not have a very happy landing my guess is that he was trying to get up enough speed to crash land in hawaii his severed head was found in a pumpkin patch it even had a few teeth knocked out which really did make him look something like a jack o lantern he wanted to die that way
1429832 agent zigmund odyssey died long before he ceased to exist his rotting lingered on most offensively all noises from him were only the stink of his return to the mud clay dirt and streams i saw his blood washed into shallow puddles his flesh devoured by worms and flies and birds i saw his bones strewn across the fields by dogs and from each bone new creatures sprang some wonderful some horrible they flew or slithered or crept away into the wilderness some were photographed at a distance by tourists whose friends and family would never believe that such manner of creature existed he was never given a funeral so let this conversation then be his funeral and lets not speak of him again for several years people said they saw his ghost jabbering hoo ha in phone booths now the phone booths have become extinct his time is over even if he had another quarter it wouldnt do him any good the operator has cut the line may his soul rest in peace
1429833 i wouldnt know but if you find the entrance feel free to contact me you might need a flashlight or something

1429846 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1429847 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters over time the substantial easing of monetary policy combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth
1429848 were a nation that loves our gadgets and it seems we take our mobiles everywhere with us even to the lavatory its amazing to think that some people will even chat and text while in the throes of passion or at funerals our survey also revealed some even stranger places that people admitted using their mobiles such as while having a filling and even during a rectal examination

1429899 very few alternative vessels are available and certainly none match the specifications of this vessel
1429900 at 105 metres long and 20 metres wide this vessel is large and stable and the predicted work rate of 80 of total time exceeds the performance of other contractors which is about 75 on average the sampling equipment will be able to drill 12 metres through not only loose sand and gravel but also through packed boulders and semi cemented rock this will result in accessing deeper diamondiferous formations which otherwise could not be reached by more traditional sampling systems additionally all geological and operational parameters will be automatically recorded for each sample and each sample hole will be cased to prevent contamination by collapse of the side walls this ensures that the results will be of very high quality and reliability there is no other vessel that meets these specifications

1429910 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1429911 the official confirmed a report that olsen wants a promise of immunity from prosecution before speaking to the drug enforcement administration olsen was a close friend of ledgers and was the first person called by a masseuse who found the 28 year old dark knight actors lifeless body in his manhattan apartment authorities have obtained a subpoena that could force olsen to appear before a grand jury if negotiations with her lawyer fail the official said

1429939 the thrust of my lab is the use of mixed cultures
1429940 the advantage of mixed cultures is that it can take just about any waste material and through our manipulations convert it into something valuable
1429941 lignocellulosic biomass is plentiful renewable and a good way to deal with wastes by using it we open the door for better economic opportunities for crop producers and rural communities and because this kind of biomass is carbon neutral we dont worry about carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere
1429942 in additional to the naked photos he took of anne 25 he also prized a sizzling photo of her in black fishnet stockings a garter belt and bustier that totally exposed her top follieri 30 supposedly paid a very famous photographer to take that steamy shot the enquirer learned that just recently annes brother michael tried to gain access to a hidden storage room in the bronx where follieri had storied some of his and annes belongings after he moved out of his apartment

1429949 we have to keep our word or sources wont trust us
1429950 the networks hyperventilating broadcasts of leaked false allegations purportedly tying the anthrax to saddam husseins iraqi regime was bad enough what the organization is doing now is journalistically unforgivable
1429951 its imperative for abc to tell us what happened here
1429952 big media and the government are already in a kind credibility death spiral this doesnt help
1429953 then he said he had to look at a lot of samples that the fbi had prepared to duplicate the letter material
1429954 our constituency doesnt like ruckus this at all not one bit
1429955 pressure on abc to out their sources should be swift and sustained
1429956 i join those who believe that some kind of congressional investigation is in order there are too many echoes of niger and uranium
1429957 reports that the anthrax letters sent to the offices of senate majority leader tom daschle contained the additive bentonite known to be used by iraq were dismissed by the white house
1429958 yet another illustration of the dangers of relying on anonymous sources and the rush to judgment when only part of the story comes out via shadowy channels
1429959 it is vital that abc news tells the american public how it came by its anthrax stories to see just who it was who manipulated the network and for what purpose
1429960 for the first time in our history were pushing up against the edge in terms of quality land
1429961 this debate is by no means over yet in the contemporary science religion discourse this debate has expanded to include mathematics physics biology cosmology philosophy and theology and questions such as the nature of infinity the beginning of time the origin and destiny of the universe and the nature of gods role in the cosmos
1429962 the ontological position upheld is the primacy of quiddity asalat al mahiyyah briefly stated this position holds existence wujud to be a derived mental concept while essence mahiyyah is considered to be primary and real
1429963 according to shahrazuri demons ifrit nasnas etc dwell in the mundus imaginalis where true dreams occur it is beyond the world of sense perception and beyond extended space but below the realm of the intellect alam al aql in this mundus imaginalis archetypes of all known things on earth exist as luminous forms there are numerous multiple levels in this realm and only god knows their number
1429964 it is my personal opinion that these interpretational difficulties are of such a nature that they hardly allow us to hope that we shall be able within the world of atoms to carry through a description in space and time that corresponds to our ordinary sensory perceptions

1429970 correcting spherical aberration in an electron microscope has long been possible in theory
1429971 but only recently has it become practical because todays stable electronics reduce drift and fast computers allow continuous adjustments in real time
1429972 but no off the shelf corrector can match team 0 5s ability to compensate even higher order aberrations
1429973 low energy electrons have longer wavelengths so they are harder to focus
1429974 aberration correction allows better than one angstrom resolution with excellent contrast even at 80 kilovolts this is important when you dont want to damage the sample with a high energy beam in biological studies for example
1429975 its because the signal to noise ratio is so good that you can adjust focus atom by atom with enough sensitivity to obtain information about the three dimensional atomic structure of a single nanoparticle
1429976 this brings us within reach of meeting the great challenge posed by the famous physicist richard feynman in 1959 the ability to analyze any chemical substance simply by looking to see where the atoms are
1429977 the chromatic aberration corrector will add two feet to the height of the team i column but the new configuration will also allow us to enlarge the gap between the pole pieces into which the sample fits in team 0 5 this gap is only about two millimeters so we have to use traditional outside mounted sample stages with limited space to manipulate the sample in team i the gap will be five millimeters the sample stage will have much greater freedom of movement
1429978 when the team project was launched in 2004 it was not quite clear if the goals could even be achieved the electron microscopy community had never done a collaborative project like team before and certainly not with full doe project management rigor
1429979 perhaps the biggest contributor to success was a series of scientific workshops that contributed to forming a converging opinion on what the next steps would be and what would constitute success that helped in getting everyone if not quite on the same page at least in the same book
1429980 this is a big jump for the microscopy community teams success will open the door to other ambitious developments around the world
1429981 for example jim zuo at the university of illinois is doing studies of electron diffraction from the surface of single nanoparticles
1429982 he sees evidence of surface contraction but when we at ncem do imaging of similar nanoparticles we find that the surface is expanding jim looks forward to using the team microscope because it can do diffraction and imaging of the same particle at the same time a grand experiment and the only way to solve the apparent contradiction
1429983 teams ability to image the structure in 3 d through tomography and its ability to do spectroscopy with single atom sensitivity can identify each kind of atom at each position in the structure that has never been possible before
