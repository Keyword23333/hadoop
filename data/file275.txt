2750023 das habe ich aber viel wichtiger ist dass ich mit menschen aus verschiedenen bereichen gesprochen habe mit journalisten mit sportlerinnen und sportlern mit sportpolitikern und mit funktion ren das war sehr aufschlussreich ich habe nicht einen einzigen geh rt der gesagt h tte da gef llt ihm irgendwas nicht es sind perfekte spiele bis jetzt es ist die freundlichkeit die h flichkeit und der stolz zu sp ren bei den chinesen bei den vielen vielen volonteers ist es so dass mein herz richtig aufgeht die 18 19 oder 20 j hrigen studenten zu sehen die lange darauf vorbereitet worden sind das ist wirklich perfekt die er ffnungsveranstaltung war auch gro e klasse ich h re von den sportlern nur gutes es ist ein wunderbares netzwerk das ich f r meine aufgabe sehr gut nutzen kann

2750026 es ist sensationell man wird nat rlich schon ein bisschen angeschaut wenn man erkannt wird und man wird sofort erkannt auch aufgrund der u eren erscheinung die leute sind unheimlich freundlich und versuchen einen zu beraten obwohl es mit der sprache sehr schwierig ist aber das geschenk f r meine tochter habe ich v llig problemlos bekommen manche dinge sind hier kompliziert wenn man zum beispiel bezahlen will dann wird ein ganzer verwaltungsakt davon gemacht mit zwei durchschl gen jeweils das ist etwas gew hnungsbed rftig w hrend in anderen dingen die chinesen ja perfekt sind das ist noch ein wenig von vorgestern was mich so fasziniert ist die architektur der stadt ich war vor 22 jahren das letzte mal mit werder bremen hier das ist eine v llig andere welt das kann man nicht vergleichen und zwar in fast allen lebensbereichen kann man das so sagen damals war es das reich mao tse tungs heute ist da etwas ganz anderes draus geworden

2750043 just shows you the twins had no idea what they were doing when they asked for hughes kennedy and melky that woulda been the steal of the century

2750046 being part of a monthly support group with other writers gave me the confidence i needed to follow gods plan for my life the encouragement and love in the room was a confirmation that making music for the purpose of blessing other people was what i wanted for my future
2750047 we did it it was perfect its a dream come true
2750048 we made plans for this a little over 12 months ago and sat down as a kind of working group going over all the scenarios for beijing
2750049 its just like a dream come true and i hope everyone can share in this dream its been a very long journey to get here so many people have helped me and i really hope they have the same feelings as i do
2750050 sometimes i felt like i was drowning there was so much water on the road
2750051 i knew it would be a good finish for me although i knew both nicole and tatiana also had a good finish
2750052 our team plan was to attack because we wanted to try to whittle down the field as much as possible so we could arrive at the finish line with as few riders as possible

2750055 the magnitude of the dollars moves and the breaking of key technical levels suggest that a major shift in the outlook towards the dollar is occurring as massive positions are adjusted
2750056 mr trichet was unable to convince the public that the ecb had not been surprised by the eurozones economic downturn
2750057 therefore the last remaining rate hike expectations were taken off the table
2750058 we need to have opportunities to do things at the right time
2750059 a lot of people can throw the football we have to find out if they can throw it under pressure
2750060 we can go by the hashmarks as to which guy we send in
2750061 i started cycling because of my family we were always sporty my mum and dad told me and my brother to do what we wanted but to always do our best
2750062 ive been talking to them and theyve been very supportive this week just as they have throughout my career i just called them and it sounded like they had half the village in the house
2750063 before the race we had a plan but our plan went back more than 12 months in terms of what we were going to do
2750064 we sat down with the british coaches and went over all the scenarios for the race sharon emma and i knew our best strength was to ride as a team
2750065 i want to thank all the people who have been there from the start i have worked so hard i am so happy
2750066 ich habe mich mit marcelinho unterhalten und er hat sich klar ge u ert
2750067 es liegt noch kein konkretes angebot vor aber es kann sein dass ich mich in der n chsten woche damit besch ftigen muss
2750068 some type of argument erupted and that lead to the shooting
2750069 weve also learned that the victim who is deceased may have actually been attempting to break up a fight
2750070 i was empty at the end just in terms of fuel i just havent had seven hour rides
2750071 the guy that i raced today wasnt the guy who won the tours so i dont put myself in that category
2750072 but it was great of him to come out and do this race and to race with all the people hes a class act out there it was fun we didnt talk a whole lot because it seemed like it was pretty much business
2750073 at the end i realized i was thoroughly cooked but i said i am having a good time
2750074 thats why i wanted to come out here i didnt expect to beat this guy so i just wanted have something out there to shoot for train for stay in shape for and it was a blast it really was
2750075 i wont come back unless im in shape and i feel like im in decent shape you cant show up to this race if youre not in shape so it just depends on how i train id love to be back
2750076 i dont know what happened its got to be flattened by now it was squishing all over
2750077 that was a product of lance and i being together
2750078 it was lances idea i would have never considered that

2750082 harris would pose as a finance broker befriend people gain their trust and assist in refinancing houses
2750083 customers would discover their house had been refinanced but for thousands of dollars more than they signed for

2750088 madrid ha venido a pek n con dos objetivos aprender de esta ciudad y de estos juegos que es un punto de partida desde donde trabajar y dar a conocer nuestro proyecto a todo el mundo nuestra candidatura no es virtual es s lida articulada y una aut ntica realidad tenemos razones y motivos para sentirnos una ciudad ol mpica hemos concebido un modelo que apuesta por un nuevo amplio y ambicioso legado ol mpico nuestro proyecto ol mpico es nuestro proyecto de ciudad representa el modelo de ciudad que queremos ser parte de este legado son las infraestructuras que madrid ya est construyendo para celebrar los mejores juegos de la historia
2750089 no s lo no se arrepiente sino que est orgullosa de su experiencia de madrid 2012 y sobre ella se est edificando 2016
2750090 para demostrar que la ciudad sea m s equilibrada sostenible y dotada de mayor capacidad de progreso
2750091 nos hemos planteado que madrid sean los juegos de las personas y nos referimos a los deportistas y ciudadanos madrid es una de las mejores opciones posibles para organizar los juegos de 2016 contamos con una sociedad ilusionada y comprometida tenemos un entorno ambiental privilegiado y una red de comunicaciones de las m s modernas
2750092 todo el mundo descubrir para l que madrid cumple con sus compromisos que nunca defrauda a quien conf a en ella
2750093 es el momento de madrid una ciudad acogedora alegre que abre la mano al mundo y abre esa mano a trav s de los juegos que queremos organizar en 2016
2750094 el 2008 ha sido magn fico y ayer gan el oro un corredor con el n mero ocho
2750095 es la hora de madrid porque es una apuesta segura
2750096 don quijote le dec a a sancho que a la hora de hacer un largo viaje hay que saber elegir a un buen compa ero madrid es un buen compa ero del olimpismo espa a es un pa s abierto abierto a los derechos la cultura gastronom a entretenimiento y trabajo y el olimpismo tambi n es un buen compa ero de viaje para madrid porque significa un buen legado en infraestructuras y valores
2750097 es un apuesta de xito y el olimpismo crecer seg n l si los juegos se organizan en la capital de espa a
2750098 madrid vincula el olimpismo con valores de los que todos participamos desarrollo urbano sostenible educaci n respeto por el medio ambiente y humanismo y eso supone un gran impulso para el olimpismo si se organizan los juegos en madrid el deporte espa ol dar un gran salto cualitativo y eso es importante para todas ciudades y tambi n para barcelona barcelona convirti ese sue o en realidad y siempre estuvo acompa ada ahora est is acompa ados con el calor y el fervor de la capital ol mpica de barcelona
2750099 ha habido mucha controversia pero cuando los atletas han empezado a participar esas controversias han empezado a desaparecer
2750100 quiero desear mucha suerte y xito a sus deportistas que han trabajado muy duro estos a os he tenido la oportunidad de vivir unos juegos y s que la vida no sigue igual despu s de esta experiencia madrid necesita ese elemento catalizador para incrementar ese aspecto humano madrid quiere organizar los juegos ol mpicos y paral mpicos es el momento de madrid espero verles en madrid en 2016

2750102 refused to listen to reason continued to interfere and threatened the officers with lawsuits
2750103 i saw what i believed to be a civil rights violation
2750104 based on my training there was no probable cause for them to search that trunk
2750105 there are laws that prevent citizens from interfering with police officers performing their duties these laws are essential to allow officers to do their jobs
2750106 the houston police department will enforce all of those laws impartially
2750107 well have like 130 guys cornering around these corners at 35 miles per hour literally just inches from each other its about as extreme as it gets its fun
2750108 mike who is our lead guy spent the whole winter in new zealand training studying to be a doctor this days his its awesome were happy for him
2750109 people can identify because its just like nascar its drafting its high speeds its dangerous people can really identify with it
2750110 the stunning admission edwards made to abcs bob woodruff and in a written statement from chapel hill on friday afternoon was that hes a narcissist
2750111 leads you to believe you can do whatever you want youre invincible and therell be no consequences
2750112 en we zijn niet kinderachtig als er een fust al bijna leeg is slaan we wel een nieuwe aan dit is voor mij de 21ste keer dat ik hier kermis vier en altijd gaat de schutterskoning rond met een blad daar komt zoveel op dat we de inkoop er uithalen maar dat is geen verplichting hoor in principe kun je op de maandagavond je portemonnee thuislaten
2750113 in order to maintain our leadership in a global economy we have to work with the rest of the world with the transfer of technology we either lead the world or we get trampled by it
2750114 nothing would have more impact on the economy and the price of oil than his election as president
2750115 there would be a boost of 1 000 points on the stock market the first week after hes elected this would be better than a chicken in every pot
2750116 i usually only sleep a few hours a night and i stay hungry a lot
2750117 i just want a place of my own with my own bed and maybe a refrigerator to keep my food in
2750118 we run across people every day who have lost their home having to live with relatives or calling from shelters
2750119 you hear a lot of talk about a future crisis in social security involving the retirement program but there is already a crisis in social security disability system people are dying while they are waiting for their disability claim to go through and thats just unacceptable
2750120 probably half or more of the people we see have disabilities that significantly interfere with whether they are able to get what they need
2750121 hopefully darrell will be able to soon qualify again for disability and be given some better choices for his life
2750122 they want to know about a lifestyle where people have homes like when you get up when you eat what household chores you are able to do
2750123 they dont know how to access someone who doesnt have their own home or bed so they tend to disregard it all disability examiners need a hard and fast education on homelessness to know how to evaluate many people
2750124 we got the letter that his disability payments were approved about a week after his funeral
2750125 we have a higher level of smokers less active population and one of the highest levels of obesity
2750126 that tends to encourage more people to file for disability thinking that because of their poor health they are unable to work but they dont understand the criteria
2750127 the problem has worsened terribly in recent years as more baby boomers get older and as congress has cut the budget for social security
2750128 at the same time there has been a cut in the field workers that handle disability claims there has simultaneously been a tremendous increase in applications its out of control
2750129 they just dont have the staff or budget to handle this exploding population
2750130 what results is people with severe disabilities having to wait terrible lengths of time
2750131 too many people are not getting paid for the social security insurance they have paid for when they were working
2750132 were making an effort with training and coordination to streamline the process
2750133 this lengthy delay only further compromises the health and stability of applicants
2750134 the state does a good job reviewing applications but it can be a complex process especially for those who are illiterate or have trouble filling our forms
2750135 higher utility gas and food prices are creating a lot more problems for many poor people
2750136 its especially difficult for persons with limited disabilities trying to get around or just understand how to navigate their way through the process to get the benefits they may be qualified to receive
2750137 i wouldnt apologize for it i certainly paid my dues
2750138 it was some unusual circumstances i happened to be in that resulted in that i certainly paid my dues
2750139 it is this elephant in the room thats been growing more obese this decade that everyone refuses to recognize
2750140 the issue is somebodys paying all this stuff has a cost
2750141 when i started teaching i was making 5 000 a year it took me 15 years to pay off my student loans
2750142 my compensation was also high in comparison to others and that got factored in
2750143 vacation time was always in the summer and i was fortunate to have good health all those years
2750144 although not in any way a typical practice among superintendents i am nevertheless embarrassed when these reports surface
2750145 the public pension system is already a substantial benefit that shouldnt require additional tweaking to squeeze out a few more dollars
2750146 in order to send a firm signal of the iocs moral consideration
2750147 there is a whole string a list of events that took place over the course of this sorry tale
2750148 this string of events really resulted in what the ioc sees as a scandalous saga that overshadowed the athens games and brought the ioc the olympic movement as a whole into disrepute based on this the board made its recommendation that she should be ineligible
2750149 we will not appeal her participation in the games what matters now is katerinas compensation
2750150 it is these totalitarian practices and decisions that bring the sporting spirit and the olympic ideal that my country gave birth to into disrepute
2750151 it affects not only the ioc but the entire olympic movement in particular the athletes participating in the olympic games
2750152 i telephoned him president sidi ould cheikh abdallahi personally to explain to him the gravity of his decree and suggest he postpone it to avoid the worst
2750153 i explained to him how it could have serious consequences how it could lead to military engagements death and destruction and that it would be best to reconsider his decision but he was stubborn
2750154 it was our duty to remind him of his humanitarian responsibilities to try to dissuade him but he chose to ignore us just as he tried to destroy the country and block its institutions
2750155 a motorist in a red audi a3 was caught driving the highest speed at 236km h
2750156 we gave it our all in the first 30 minutes but couldnt maintain the momentum
2750157 i cant believe that god has taken us all this way for me to be doing what i am doing right now
2750158 what makes the bible different that other religious scriptures is that it is story sprinkled with instruction not instruction sprinkled with story
2750159 thanks for traveling down to the game to support our boys
2750160 we value a connection to the community of faith around the world and throughout history because this is and has been gods primary way of revealing himself
2750161 god gave us a community before he gave us a book
2750162 they know that if they refuse to work they will be replaced by the next cheapest workforce what they do not know is that they can report this
2750163 we also get situations where workers claim for compensation but then struggle to locate their employers for additional information especially in short term construction situations
2750164 when injured workers claim they dont act in their best interest as they follow instructions from management
2750165 there are many more cases of workers getting injured or killed at work that go unreported and the department of labour is not cooperative in terms of giving us statistics of cases that are under their investigation
2750166 the shortage of inspectors is also of concern to us as employers continue to maximise their profits by pushing workers into intolerable working conditions
2750167 arte sem arte uma forma de arte em que tudo vale
2750168 a racont un correspondant de l dition russe de lhebdomadaire newsweek

2750174 cdep is one hell of a weapon to take aboriginal peoples rights
2750175 its a killer its worse than bashing women its worse than bashing children its worse than drugs
2750176 i would like to take every dollar of cdep and build a training school and give skills to our people for their future
2750177 veel kroegen uit de buurt hebben nog helemaal geen bezoek gehad van de voedsel en waren autoriteit
2750178 we have asked asa to look at tra as an alternative to uncontrolled airspace because it gives a greater ability to be aware of all the traffic in that airspace
2750179 airservices seems bent on shifting the blame to those who have been holding a failing system together rather than accepting the consequences of its own mismanagement of human resources across an extended period of time
2750180 clare martin was still saying she expected labor to win all of their 19 seats on the morning of the poll which was broadcast as a lead media item territory wide over and over again this was despite hendersons attempt last night to say he always said it was going to be close they werent listening to him they were listening to clare
2750181 gave people an excuse to vote against the government rather than for the clp
2750182 vouchers represent an attempt to commodify education and an abrogation on the part ofgovernment for ensuring planned provision of education
2750183 rather the structure and funding of vet has to give students and industry the power to get providers to respond to their needs
2750184 there are a number of ways of achieving this reform but an ill thought through badly implemented voucher program like the howard governments work skills vouchers isnt one of them
2750185 the last voucher system was trialled but it really was both poorly targeted and inadequately funded
2750186 we are just keen to see that in the next commonwealth and state agreement that comes in force in july next year whatever funding agreement is ultimately agreed that theres a lift in training funding
2750187 its been almost four years since the tragic death in custody and too many questions remain unanswered
2750188 the old saying is that the wheels of justice grind slowly we would like for them to grind a lot quicker
2750189 the investigation is nearing completion and it is expected a report will be provided to the cmc who have been overviewing the matter in the near future
2750190 esta medalla es algo bueno para georgia especialmente en tiempos como estos

2750194 before this game i dont think theres anybody who gives us a chance to play like we did tonight versus the european champions
2750195 we in the beginning of the game gave them too much respect
2750196 it got to a point where personally i got mad we can play with these guys those guys arent gods
2750197 kljestan kept going the defender was going to try to reach for the ball because he thought i was going to pass sacha through and i just went right in between his legs to sacha
2750198 im not sure how else we shouldve handled the last 10 minutes
2750199 were disappointed we gave up the equalizer but we have to get this out of our heads and focus on the positive things we can take out of it
2750200 a cura para o cancro e a bolsa de ac es
2750201 il gioco avr naturalmente forti attinenze con la pellicola cui si ispira
2750202 we are a little bit stiff on the court at first as it is the olympics and it is 21 point scoring system
2750203 there is no much difference between the olympic games and other tournaments
2750204 it started with people looking in the window and making comments outside and they told me their points of view that they found it offensive
2750205 other shop traders also told me that people were saying to them that it was offensive and that i should cover her up or move her so i put a camisole on emily and someone else made another comment saying that they could still see the bump so i put her in the corner of the shop away from the window
2750206 how bout a sticker on the side of your suv that says its a hybrid
2750207 it was definitely out of my control as so much stuff is in this business i had such high hopes for lost hotel even before i released it i shopped it around to some different labels and had interest from even rca
2750208 i dealt with them for around six months talking back and forth until they finally passed on me i then went ahead and released it through sustain records down here in texas because i felt there was an opportunity there to try something different and hopefully have some success
2750209 you have to understand that at that time i was struggling to keep my career alive i really wasnt pulling any huge crowds it had been three years since my last record and that one was a live album
2750210 i told myself to be patient with lost hotel i knew that it would not hit immediately i knew that i was going to have to work my ass off to get the point of that album across to people and i convinced myself and my boys that they will get it eventually i would say prayers that someone was listening somewhere and eventually it turned out they were the beauty of this scene came through for me one person heard it they passed it to their buddy who passed it on etcetera and word of mouth made my career happen
2750211 i just feel really comfortable with rock sounds and going back to the sounds my sisters had playing back when i was a kid
2750212 it develops and builds into this energy that you cant find in just simple straightforward country music but having said that my roots are imbedded in country music and they always will be songwriting is my passion and my voice will never be anything but country i just think being exposed to all the different sounds as a kid shaped the kind of artist i became
2750213 its clich but im still just a fan myself and constantly find myself amazed that im sharing a stage with someone like a ray wylie hubbard or hearing my songs on the radio from time to time
2750214 i made my decisions based on what i thought was best for me at that time and it just so happened to follow what pat had done people talk and it has all worked out in the end for both of us plus i got a song out of it god bless this town
2750215 our first gig was in 1998 at the lubbock stubbs bbq we had like three hundred people there and thought we were rock stars
2750216 it was a group of young guys that knew nothing about recording or making a record im surprised we even got a record at all but we did
2750217 the record title says it all i was living a dream making my very own album looking back im happy with that record for what it is
2750218 it was such a cool time fun to be out at shows playing for people traveling to new towns wed never even heard of before it was back in the day when it wasnt work and we didnt look at it that way it really was all just for fun
2750219 we were hitting all these towns and clubs and seeing all these bands that sounded and looked the same i knew we had to go to a higher level
2750220 it was around the time of try not to listen that i realized this was going to be a career it was no longer just a fun hobby i was determined to work my tail off and get to the next level
2750221 i think when try not to listen came out personally both wade and i were tired a little frustrated and questioning what our future would be we didnt know what graduation would bring or how much longer we could keep this project and band on the road at the pace we were at we were three years in and we knew it was make it or break it time
2750222 when i graduated and moved to austin i had to start over completely because lubbock is so far away from everywhere so i did and thats where the west 84 became extinct i knew that i was serious and i questioned that about the rest of the band as a group so i took matters into my own hands and started playing acoustic shows wherever they would let me eventually people came to know wade bowen instead of west 84
2750223 that record definitely started to spread the word about us i remember being amazed at how many we were selling week after week actually im still amazed at how many still sell the blue light threw that idea at me and i just ran with it i decided to just record one night instead of a couple of nights i felt that would make it more real and honest and i think thats what people like about it so much
2750224 we had made a name for ourselves as this rocking band and doing audioslave breakdowns mixed with waylon and i knew that as cool as that was and is i wanted to also be known as a serious songwriter so i set out to prove to people that i was a serious songwriter and lost hotel was the product of that
2750225 i got frustrated many nights i would wander back to the van and head back to the room as soon as i could so that i could just go to sleep and go to another town
2750226 people started to get it and who i was one by one and in the end thats what matters to me with all the cheesy stuff out there lost hotel stands out because its the furthest thing from it anyone who listens to that album knows or at least has a glimpse into what i went through to make it and write it and thats what is so special about it to me and as excited as i am about this new album i still dont think lost hotel is done
2750227 there are a lot of shady folks in the music business and very few are as genuine as wade bowen and everyone i know in the texas scene would echo that sentiment
2750228 wade bowen is a classy genuine soul and a dear friend whom ive enjoyed watching as his star continues to grow
2750229 when i first went in to make this album i told my producer and the band that i wanted to keep things as upbeat as possible we tried but it was really crazy how everyone just felt it go right back into that lost hotel vein we laughed about it a little actually because i guess its just me
2750230 we also ended up cutting some outside tunes and i think when people hear them theyll realize why i had to include them i ended up setting aside some of my favorite songs that id written to make sure the record was perfect for me as an artist and i couldnt be happier with the results
2750231 i really feel like this album is going to put me over the hump as an all around artist everything weve done has built to this point i hope radio will get behind us on this project and i want everything for this record to explode like i think it will so i can implement some really cool ideas ive been sitting on
2750232 i dont have the biggest crowds i dont make the most money and i dont get played on the radio very much but for some reason people throw me up there as one of the big dogs in the texas scene and i believe its because i did it my way the way i wanted
2750233 hey bud that ad was funny as hell im up for some frisbee send me a pic so i know who im talking to i live in my hometown im 29 and i need some physical activity my girlfriend keeps telling me to get out and do something but all my friends are busy all the time either that or they just dont care now dont get me wrong im not fat but im not completely in shape i own a business too so im usually home able to have some fun let me know bud j
2750234 ja dat vind ik ook bedankt ik zal het doorgeven in de kleedkamer
2750235 als de bal op doel is moet er een goede keeper staan anders vliegt hij erin gelukkig was dat het geval want een snelle thuisreis zit niet in mijn planning
2750236 maar het gaat niet alleen om voetbaltechnische zaken ik wil er eerst met foppe over praten
2750237 ik hoor het wel maar ik handel altijd naar eer en geweten
2750238 onze selectie is momenteel erg krap bezet daarom hebben we vincent nodig
2750239 we hadden met de belgische bond al de afspraak gemaakt dat we hem na de tweede wedstrijd terug konden halen
2750240 we waren duidelijk nog niet klaar voor dit zware toernooi
2750241 ik werk met spelers die zich in de voorbereiding op een lang seizoen bevinden
2750242 ze kunnen op dit moment gewoon nog niet tot op de bodem gaan daar hebben ze het vermogen nog niet voor maar ik blijf hopen dat het er allemaal nog eens uitkomt hier in china want ze kunnen wel allemaal voetballen hoor
2750243 de meeste spelers moeten nog leren om met elkaar samen te spelen dat is een probleem tegen nigeria 0 0 hadden we daar ook last van
2750244 het was niet makkelijk op dit veld maar we hebben er ons voordeel van gemaakt deze zege zegt echter niets het volgende duel begint weer met 0 0
2750245 we zijn dit weer natuurlijk gewend in nederland ik heb tegen de meiden gezegd maak er je voordeel van dat hebben ze gedaan dit is een lekker begin een goede warming up we kijken echter al weer naar de volgende wedstrijd tegen zuid korea
2750246 we weten dat haar rug kwetsbaar is ze ging door haar rug we moeten afwachten hoe het maandag gaat
2750247 oh no im fine im just trying to get better fuel mileage
2750248 i took a sabbatical from teaching this is my project its my attempt to bridge the gap from game community to a new form of game scholarship initially my real purpose was to demonstrate at wabash that you can be serious about games the blog started and it became clear to me that this is something that could be integrated into the liberal arts it was a lightbulb moment
2750249 it all started as conversation but now part of my mission with brainy gamer is to convince people that games can and should be a part of a curriculum its difficult we have people who are saying just let me play games and have fun but there are also those who have never played games and who are saying how can we let this in the academy i think both groups are resistant but for totally different reasons
2750250 what would it take to grow these kinds of communities
2750251 one thing id like to see is for developers to join these conversations with us steve gaynor is one good example and design rampage is another developer who blogs about design and communicates with the wider community developers could add a dimension we often dont see
2750252 part of what game criticism is doing is that theres a kind of teaching mission were presuming we have something interesting to say to help people understand and appreciate games better potentially that appreciation will enable the group to grow
2750253 i think its a bigger space than we may think the community developed i think largely due to college and grad students there are a surprisingly large number of people who write thoughtful essays and comments on my blog enough people are interested to make it a critical mass
2750254 narrative games are barely past the infant stage and critical commentary and analysis about them are even less developed
2750255 everyone is still trying to figure out who everyone else is and in this process communities form themselves we are on the ground floor of this effort to try to figure out how to talk intelligently about video games how to analyze them and develop a critical language to discuss them were not like other disciplines im not even sure i would call us a discipline yet because were all figuring this out together we dont even have the terms yet
2750256 a very typical example how did i meet mirch krpata well someone linked me to something which linked to him somewhere i contacted him and he kindly responded thats pretty much how it works
2750257 even or especially outside of academia people are on unsure footing leighs the only one who dared to suggest a term for the most part people seem to be quiet about it
2750258 part of our trepidation about what to call it is that there is already a field called game studies and some of us arent comfortable with where thats going or dont feel we quite fit in there game studies is taking a fairly traditional academic approach to research and scholarship and as a professor who has done my share of papers and conferences im trying to go another way i want to write about games at the place where they are being discussed most vigorously online and amongst gamers i greatly respect what game studies is doing and ive benefited from this work but ive reached the point in my career where im not terribly interested in traditional academic research anymore
2750259 schools are nervous about games becoming academic without rigor or structured pedagogy im concerned about it too frankly i dont want it to be just discussions and nothing else
2750260 between having both the common gamer and academics strongly disapproving of the way you and the rest of us talk it sounds like you have quite the fight on your hands
2750261 its not a fight its making a case what is the place of conversation about video games in the liberal arts is it possible to teach the odyssey and the metal gear series in the same class can you leverage students interest in games to get them to think critically write persuasively and discuss intelligently all of which are goals of a liberal arts education i obviously think the answer is yes
2750262 this is what i have dreamed of since i was 11 years old
2750263 we did it it was perfect its a dream come true
2750264 im glad the chinese authorities laid on some nice welsh weather for me
2750265 it was a very tactical very hard race and i was always concerned that the group behind would catch us
2750266 i came over the line and there was so much i was just so happy and there were so many emotions that were coming out all at once
2750267 i made so much noise because i guess thats just the person i am
2750268 i want to thank all the people who have been there from the start i have worked so hard i am so happy
2750269 i dont think it has sunk in yet i still feel like the normal nicole from before the race but its just so exciting
2750270 we all knew that we were good riders but the best chance that we had was to ride as a team
2750271 emma gave up her bid for glory but it meant that i could ride defensively and also save myself
2750272 i think it put the other teams on the back foot the team worked so hard and the organisation was the best it ever has been its a pity they cant all get medals
2750273 emma and sharon did an awesome job in supporting nicole in her race for gold
2750274 what you cant perhaps quite sense at home is just the torrential rain that was falling on beijing and despite those incredibly tough weather conditions she won so its a wonderful victory and a huge lift for team gb
2750275 this is a great start to the beijing olympics for team gb and i have no doubt this medal will fire up the rest of the team to do their best in the next two weeks
2750276 well done to nicole cooke she has set us on our way
2750277 normally im good in the rain but the problem was that it was really cold
2750278 whats a good cheap alcohol free thing i could do with tonight
2750279 entre la doctora y el maestro han conseguido animarme me han dicho que mi hija me estaba esperando en madrid y que ten a que ir a buscarla con una medalla al cuello
2750280 tambi n me han dicho que esta oportunidad no pod a desaprovecharla
2750281 que se tapaba la cara con una bandera porque no pod a ver el combate por los nervios
2750282 est n af nicos de todo lo que me han animado ellos tambi n se merecen la medalla
2750283 muchos diplomas ol mpicos y medallas de todos los colores en campeonatos del mundo y de europa
2750284 la llevamos buscando mucho tiempo hemos trabajado desde el primero al ltimo desde todos los puntos de la federaci n todos los maestros todos los monitores todos los clubes para conseguir una medalla este ciclo ha sido fant stico ten amos que tener una medalla ol mpica como fuera
2750285 me ha tocado a m he tenido la suerte de conseguirla pero esto va a animar a mis compa eros que vienen despu s y les va a dar mucha fuerza para que consigan m s medallas
2750286 mis compa eros tienen tanta o m s calidad que yo vienen de hacer medallas en copa del mundo son tiradores muy fuertes hemos venido preparados y hemos entrenado duro para llegar aqu esto va a empujarles y les va a dar nimos capaces son seguro
2750287 this raises very serious questions about sincerity and their attitude towards our country and will of course be taken into account in the future when we hold talks and talk about global issues
2750288 our position is of course negative it will of course be expressed when our minister sergei lavrov speaks on the phone with secretary of state condoleezza rice
2750289 western media is a well organised machine which is showing only those pictures which fit in well with their thoughts we find it very difficult to squeeze our opinion in the pages of their newspapers
2750290 just as it was 20 30 years ago it remains the same today objectivity is not a typical trait of some western journalists and television channels
2750291 ocean beach activism is truly dead ob go went starbucks still here subway submarina wings all came im sure the next project the planning board will approve will be the gas station project where the garden used to be on voltaire well if greed doesnt win at first try keep trying until you run off the people in charge and you can get your

2750308 maybe leftwich can tell us how to defeat the jaguars since hes probably been responsible for more of their losses than the steelers are
2750309 you keep using that word i do not think it means what you think it means

2750317 im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2750318 we have no plans to insert money in either of those institutions
2750319 it was very important that we get these temporary backup facilities because fannie and freddie are very important to our capital markets
2750320 lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2750321 i didnt know who your father was until we took dna tests
2750322 it is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit
2750323 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2750324 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2750325 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2750326 it is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit
2750327 error braced group within expression allowed only inside a function
2750328 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2750329 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2750330 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2750331 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2750332 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2750333 oil and the diamonds and the uranium and the we have much to be concerned about in 2008 and 2009 and 2010 and so on especially if the rhetoric of continues to be used
2750334 a list was presented to help bring about positive changes to our society this list is provided below the first step in resisting is to educate ourselves and those that follow us war is no longer an option if humanity is to survive
2750335 if we accept that it is desirable for individuals to practice moral agency as fully as possible then we should seek to create a different kind of media system

2750345 in my opinion there are already elements of some of kind of genocide of the ossetian people
2750346 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy of their borders
2750347 tell me do you have some questions about first grade
2750348 yeah mom i have to learn how to jump rope and take timed tests before tomorrow begins
2750349 sometimes i have made the wrong decisions sometimes i have not been up to the task you get those periods but the key is to keep focus and keep your confidence up
2750350 my attitude is it doesnt matter what you have done before but what really comes
2750351 the way prasanna prasad and mendis scored runs really swayed the tempo to our camp when we walked into the field
2750352 hes got a great bunch of senior bowlers he can talk to whether its fast bowlers or spinners the character and intelligence hes shown i am sure as the years go by hell get better and better
2750353 it is a very big call to accuse someone on suspicion only
2750354 so unless people have been caught and disqualified i think it is very unfair to the clean competitors
2750355 i believe that once you have used before you would never go back to being clean those athletes who have been banned should not be competing
2750356 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is also a fabulous woman
2750357 bachmans is in the business of helping families express their sentiments in times of joy and in times of sorrow
2750358 we are simply overwhelmed with the gratitude and the outpouring of sympathy and well wishes from all over the world the calls and e mails were receiving are from peoples hearts and they speak so well of this extraordinary man
2750359 certainly a steady hand and a calm hand at the wheel at all time
2750360 i can only offer the deepest shock and sorrow we all feel here because the bachman family was always so close to our program
2750361 they still came back to support her former high school teams
2750362 it was just a great great couple supporting the programs and supporting the school
2750363 he never wanted to be above anybody their comments were always positive it never appeared to me in all these years ive known him that he was above anybody else i never got that kind of impression they were great human beings
2750364 he was just so incredibly supportive as a father of an athlete some people can get a little worked up at sporting events but he was just there in the stands waving his flag whether it was for team usa for ucla or for lakeville
2750365 the pdp has decided to join the march to muzaffarabad on monday the call for which has been given by fruit growers association
2750366 such a step would be wrong for both the fruit growers and the country
2750367 i caught him with the same punch before and when he came forward i saw that he was wide open to the body
2750368 this is one of the hardest moments of my career and one of the hardest decisions ive had to take
2750369 ive tried everything to recover laser treatment magnetic treatment ive had more treatments in 10 days than ive had in my life
2750370 it was something that was special because it made me realise how many people are inspired by him and that im now in the position to have that opportunity to go out there and get a medal for my country
2750371 a bad fault is hard to recover from she might be more cautious than before
2750372 but shes been preparing for a long time she may be more careful but i think she should come through
2750373 and thats why ive decided to hire you out to martin deluce for a summer
2750374 organising something on the scale of the lambeth conference will inevitably result in a small deficit sometimes
2750375 the archbishops council met last week to propose a solution
2750376 it is possible there was no one to address the problem in eilat
2750377 a call to action saving lives through nuclear weapons control and disarmament
2750378 it felt like someone had opened the door of a furnace behind you
2750379 weve got to get rid of these nuclear weapons before something terrible happens
2750380 both sides of the camp are talking about the need to reduce nuclear weapons
2750381 what learn to write complete sentences with punctuation and we might be able to answer you
2750382 today news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2750383 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
2750384 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
2750385 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
2750386 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2750387 mccain obviously took time to determine first that russia had indeed attacked georgia before demanding restraint from the victim its apparent that mccain has a better grasp of the situation and understood its ramifications as events unfolded obama issued a boilerplate statement that generically demanded that everyone start getting along and had to modify his stance as his 300 foreign policy advisers had a chance to tutor him on the conflict
2750388 id rather vote for the man who gets it right and has spent years studying foreign affairs warfare and american strategic needs than the man who makes it up as he goes along mccain is right this was a 3 am moment and obama proved himself unprepared and unsuited to answer the call
2750389 our stance would not change with sanctions or the threat of sanctions
2750390 it is important that our country is ready to insist on its rights under any conditions

2750422 tijdens onze tocht gingen we op zoek naar horecazaken die hun gasten enkel in het frans bedienen we hebben diverse fotos genomen van wat voor ons flagrante inbreuken zijn tegen het taalprincipe
2750423 maar uiteraard is de taalwet niet afdwingbaar op private personen daarom willen we deze vorm van verregaande verfransing principieel aanklagen we gaan in dit verband een dossier samenstellen en voorleggen aan vlaams minister president kris peeters en vlaams minister voor inburgering marino keulen we hopen dat er maatregelen komen
2750424 onze doelstelling was in de eerste plaats de verregaande verfransing in het vlaamse de panne onder de aandacht brengen

2750428 man besorgt sich also einen kern aus hartem wolfram und tr gt darauf eine 1 5 millimeter dicke goldschicht auf
2750429 au erdem liegt so ein ummantelter barren wie ein echter in der hand hat das richtige gewicht und w rde vermutlich sogar einen r ntgentest bestehen
2750430 die einzige m glichkeit w re die bereits eingelagerten echten barren gegen falsche auszuwechseln ich w rde viel darauf wetten dass es in thiopien genau so gelaufen ist

2750462 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2750463 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2750464 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2750465 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2750466 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2750467 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2750468 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
2750469 candor is the most effective where nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
2750470 this has got to be a historic moment father and son two presidents opening an embassy my dad was a fabulous president
2750471 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
2750472 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
2750473 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
2750474 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries
2750475 a large trend is being crystallized among the palestinian national authority pna in ramallah to call for settling the situation with the gaza strip by force
2750476 to give the last chance for the egyptian government and the arab league to convince hamas to immediately end its coup and engage in the dialogue
2750477 but the door for dialogue will not be open forever and the leadership only gave one month time for the efforts
2750478 will be a dangerous thing if it was officially made
2750479 it will boost the internal split and separate gaza from the west bank
2750480 fatah elements who dominate the plos executive committee have a plan to prevent any attempt of approach between hamas and fatah
2750481 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2750482 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2750483 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2750484 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2750485 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2750486 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2750487 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2750488 each night god cleans up the mess the argentines make by day
2750489 it was too obviously drawn up by a poorly educated teenage girl
2750490 all in all it just sounds like another load of drivel that makes me pleased i no longer use a tv
2750491 the national endowment for the arts gave between 100 000 and 249 000 to help underwrite the festival and the public broadcasting system pbs gave between 50 000 and 99 999
2750492 herbie popnecker a parody of a superhero first appeared in forbidden worlds 73 in december 1958 published by acg american comics group it was the introduction of the antithesis of a hero short fat young but this unlikely hero was one of the most powerful and best known beings in history deriving some of his powers from genetics and some from magical lollipops from the unknown herbie could talk to animals who knew him by name fly by walking on air become invisible and when he got his own comic travel through time

2750494 to me its just internal bickering to try and do the liberal party harm they are completely false allegations
2750495 anonymous correspondence was forwarded to the department of premier and cabinet for advice on the appropriate course of action
2750496 a letter advising of this action was also sent to the email address which had sent the correspondence
2750497 the unified modeling language is a standard language for specifying visualizing constructing and documenting the artifacts of software systems
2750498 operations of this sort that involve the nsw police force and community are important in ensuring that people can enjoy themselves in a safe drug free environment
2750499 it is also good to ensure that we have stopped such dangerous addictive drugs from being distributed to juveniles as well as the general community and we are very pleased to have had the co operation of the general community it is a very pleasing result
2750500 i was screaming get out at him and he was saying things to me but it all happened so fast i cant remember what he was saying at my age you dont need these things
2750501 kim was in the hallway she was hysterical she was screaming the police think thats why he left that maybe he was sacred off by all the noise
2750502 ive lived here for 58 years and its never happened before id never had any experiences like this weve never even had a break in
2750503 we have been doing workshops with around 500 students from local high schools and youth organisations
2750504 we try to encourage the people involved to give us stories to create skits about how it feels when they have been put down what they have done and how they can resolve it
2750505 whats coming from bullying is generally fear anger and revenge
2750506 the victim generally needs a boost in self esteem but what we discover is that the perpetrators also have low self esteem
2750507 its more difficult to reach those kids because of language limitations and because of social economic reasons
2750508 its not an amateur theatre we pay our actors and artists to enable them to run workshops and shows
2750509 its not unusual for p platers but its certainly unusual for someone on their l plates because they would normally have someone responsible supervising them
2750510 one of the main areas where this applies is if an l plate driver gets breath tested
2750511 its a zero limit for the learner but the instructor gets breath tested as well and the normal 05 limit still applies to them
2750512 the iemma government has to meet its obligations to fund public schools or we are going to see unacceptable levels of corporate intrusion into our schools as seen in america
2750513 the department has set up an infrastructure working party including the school principal and members of the school community to develop a four year master plan for the school and to explore the communitys ideas
2750514 u s backed oil pipeline runs through georgia allowing the west to reduce its reliance on middle eastern oil while bypassing russia and iran

2750521 if israel the united states or european intelligence gets proof that iran has succeeded in developing nuclear weapons technology then israel will respond in a manner reflecting the existential threat posed by such a weapon
2750522 israel will almost surely attack irans nuclear sites in the next four to seven months
2750523 and the leaders in washington and even tehran should hope that the attack will be successful enough to cause at least a significant delay in the iranian production schedule if not complete destruction of that countrys nuclear program
2750524 whispered in musharrafs ear that it is time to leave
2750525 over the next few days they will make it clear to him musharraf that a protracted battle against impeachment is not in pakistans interests
2750526 there should be no more than a 3 percent penalty in fuel economy
2750527 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2750528 this is not about questioning the managers judgment or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
2750529 i spoke with kaka yesterday saturday we know that the clubs are talking about the transfer although they have not reached a conclusion yet
2750530 i think an august transfer is still a possibility though kaka will only talk about that when they do a deal he is waiting for a deal and then he will start to negotiate with chelsea
2750531 normally milan do not sell their best players we think they like the proposal but it is not so easy for them to accept it for now we must just wait and see
2750532 putting bilateral relations at a normal footing at israels expense
2750533 there have been no firm agreements or understandings or any kind of concerted work
2750534 the negotiating track is open there are contacts between the parties
2750535 according to foreign media israel is active inside iranian territory
2750536 some of the 40 000 rockets of syrian and iranian manufacture can hit israeli targets as far south as beersheba 350 kilometres away from hizbollah launching pads north of lebanons litani river not only has tel aviv come within range but hizbollah and the palestinian hamas in gaza with their ideological weltanschauung view of the world can between them cover most of israel except for its southern most tip at eilat on the red sea using these two surrogates tehran can therefore make war on israel and keep its hands clean

2750538 the merrill economists are most concerned about saskatchewan where the doubling of house prices in regina and saskatoon over the past two years means they estimate these markets are almost 50 per cent overvalued

2750542 we strive to be creative youth workers who engage in theology ministry formation practice relationships service and life with a prophetic imagination that cooperates fully with the mission of god
2750543 it is not advancing technology that is creating the information bind however it is societal regression first by perverting the natural instincts of curiosity and adventure into a dogged quest for certainty and second by focusing on pathology rather than on strength the thinking processes in an age of discovery that is marked by a spirit of wonder are quite different from those that characterize an anxiety driven dash for the truth the latter is more likely to lead to reductionist thinking the reification of models and an overbearing seriousness all of which rigidify rather than free the imaginative capacity

2750548 it was kind of interesting leading right by my side with don chaffer in the room
2750549 these findings should not be surprising because cocaine and other drugs are traded using cash which is handled by the same fingers that directly touch the drugs or wrappings
2750550 moreover many cocaine users use a wrapped banknote to sniff this drug so inducing direct cocaine contamination of the banknotes
2750551 on july 12th 2006 two israeli soldiers were kidnapped during their patrol by hezbollah terrorists who crossed into the israeli border and took them for two years hezbollah would not confirm if they were dead or alive this week i watched tv with two of my daughters waiting for these soldiers to be brought from the lebanon border to israel we still did not know their condition one way or the other it was not until the final moment when the two coffins were brought forward that we knew they were dead tears flowed tears for the families for our nation for our great loss great grief and anger is what we are feeling as a nation tears when their bodies returned anger because hezbollah had refuesed to tell us if they were dead or alive tears because the small hope of them being returned alive was dashed anger that we have now released 5 lebanese prisoners all of them alive one of these men was a terrorist by the name of samir kuntar a man who left lebanon and made his way to nahariya israel where he shot and drowned an israeli father in front of his 4 year old daughter then in cold blood bashed her little head against the rocks killing her he has now returned to lebanon this child killer to a red carpet and heros welcome as people rejoice that he is free in lebanon today his brutal crime means nothing only that he is free from israel and home with them this week we grieve and we bury our dead idf reservists ehud goldwasser and eldad regev

2750557 many ancient christian practices might not be well known or commonly practiced in your local church you may have never heard of some of them before but these spiritual disciplines have been a vital part of the christian faith for centuries
2750558 this doesnt strike me as blending well with the established family friendly atmosphere of sheridan
2750559 das ist kein problem einzelner schichten das betrifft lehrer piloten und anw lte genauso wie arbeitslose
2750560 die ursachen f r dieses problem sind sehr unterschiedlich und vielschichtig
2750561 um nur mal ein beispiel zu nennen wenn kinder unsportlich sind und von den mitsch lern nur ungern in sportmannschaften gew hlt werden werden sie m glicherweise auch auf anderen gebieten immer weiter ausgegrenzt
2750562 mach erst einmal den abschluss vorher hast du eh zu wenig zeit
2750563 ive nothing much to offer theres nothing much to take im an absolute beginner
2750564 ich habe nicht viel zu geben es gibt nicht viel zu nehmen ich bin ein blutiger anf nger
2750565 einige betroffene kommen mit ihrer situation zwar sehr gut zurecht doch die meisten leiden darunter
2750566 sie sind ungl cklich so wie andere menschen mit etwas in ihrem leben unzufrieden sind doch sie haben sich oft auch schon mit ihrem leben ohne partner arrangiert
2750567 ich war lange zeit nicht wirklich ungl cklich mit meiner situation aber seit einigen jahren tut es richtig weh wenn ich sonntags alleine durch den park spaziere und die ganzen paare sehe dann sehne ich mich besonders stark nach einer eigenen beziehung
2750568 ich habe jetzt aber erkannt dass ich mich nicht nur gr men sondern aktiv etwas ndern muss
2750569 das ist nicht so einfach und kostet einige berwindung aber es klappt langsam immer besser
2750570 theyve got estates over there that look just like ours
2750571 except there are still bullet holes in the buildings and thats in the nice part its definitely being opened up a bit because theyve just joined the eu but away from the touristy part its still a deep and eerie vibe its like my friend over there was saying the fa ade is thin it feels like anything could happen at any time and sometimes it does
2750572 it started out with a lot of more reflective tunes about how sad shit is and what a fucked up world we live in because that was kind of where my head was at the time
2750573 those are two of the most important rappers in america as far as the hip hop scene is concerned
2750574 these are certified gangsta rappers the real deal its not a joke and theyre on a grime tune respecting it and understanding that im different but in some way we come from the same place for me thats a real achievement for british hip hop
2750575 numbers words thats what i do the writing side is the english the notes the beats the deals the money thats the maths but its about going to school too and how everything ive learnt since then has made me look back and reflect on that in fact everything youre thinking thats what it is
2750576 common sense is part of the home made ideology of those who have been deprived of fundamental learning of those who have been kept ignorant this ideology is compounded from different sources items that have survived from religion items of empirical knowledge items of protective skepticism items culled for comfort from the superficial learning that is supplied but the point is that common sense can never teach itself can never advance beyond its own limits for as soon as the lack of fundamental learning has been made good all items become questionable and the whole function of common sense is destroyed common sense can only exist as a category insofar as it can be distinguished from the spirit of inquiry from philosophy
2750577 im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2750578 we have no plans to insert money in either of those institutions
2750579 it was very important that we get these temporary backup facilities because fannie and freddie are very important to our capital markets
2750580 lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2750581 prevention is straightforward prevent bites and vaccinate those at risk of bites
2750582 the waraos told us it was because there were too many bats that were biting the children
2750583 gracias por hacer esta noche tan especial a esta isla que tanto queremos nuestra carrera comenzo aqu y por eso este es un p blico muy especial para m
2750584 i have left the party and the press office as i feel that the current programme for government of the stormont administration will put working class communities under increased pressure at a time when the current global credit crunch is already hurting this vulnerable group in society
2750585 as a respectfull society put a ring in your hand and if some one stops you you simply tell him iam married for us is a status really respected in morocco
2750586 och vad r det f r m rkv rdigt med det d
2750587 the allies could have undid the cruel versailles treaty and made it clear that germany would get a fair shake in future negotiations on territorial issues
2750588 in the early thirties i believe there were enough reasonable germans that would have rejected the radical nazi line if they saw that the allies would give them a reasonable deal your source for that belief is what exactly
2750589 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league
2750590 it could have a significant chilling effect on the reporting of the private lives of celebrities
2750591 the most significant changes to the privacy act in the 20 years of its existence
2750592 there is a strong expectation that special minister of state senator john faulkner will commit the government to act on the alrcs recommendations and that he will introduce relevant legislative amendments in the foreseeable future
2750593 protection of privacy needs to be balanced against the public interest in allowing the free flow of information and upholding freedom of speech
2750594 it has not been demonstrated that existing privacy protections fail to achieve this balance
2750595 the alrc has failed to demonstrate a breach of privacy by the media is not already dealt with by existing laws such as defamation and surveillance laws or self regulation by the media
2750596 the law would be irrelevant to ordinary citizens in whom the media has no interest it would be open to abuse by irresponsible claimants who would clog our already over burdened courts
2750597 such a law would simply allow rich people to employ lawyers in a bid to avoid scrutiny of their wrongdoing
2750598 it allows the rich powerful and celebrities to manipulate their images in the way they want them manipulated rather than having some transparency
2750599 they said privacy laws would be ok on the whole if anyone with a pr agent was exempt from taking an action
2750600 i think it may be a sensible development for the media as it would mean the defamation laws dont get stretched to be used as a substitute for proper protection against invasion of privacy
2750601 yep i like the idea of a right to privacy and yep i like the idea of a right to freedom of expression
2750602 the continued growth of online advertising demonstrates a growing confidence in the medium and importantly shows the increasing inclusion of online advertising in marketers strategic plans
2750603 all segments search display and classifieds continue to grow significantly and the combined total surpassing 1 5 billion for the first time is testament to the strength of the industry here in australia
2750604 to achieve a growth rate of 27 per cent year on year indicates the growing importance of online advertising in the media mix
2750605 there is still much work to be done however to educate and inform key industries yet to fully embrace online advertising in particular fast moving consumer goods retail and government on the effectiveness online advertising plays not only in direct response but also in branding
2750606 advertisers can continue to invest confidently in online advertising knowing their target audience is spending more of their time online and that online advertising offers a cost effective platform to reach and engage with them
2750607 with advertising expenditure exceeding 1 5 billion over a 12 month period for the first time strong growth can be seen across all markets segments
2750608 i think of it from the perspective that were now moving earning our living from being in outdoors to being heavily invested right across the board
2750609 there are some surveys that show while theres high awareness of the environment it remains low involvement but sustainability is clearly going to become a part of everyday business it is becoming part of what our clients do
2750610 outdoor still only gets just 4 per cent of media spending but what were saying now is the medium is new and fresh
2750611 their interests change as often as the singles chart weekly
2750612 im reading the magazine but im also online im also watching tv and im also downloading on my mobile
2750613 expressed the view to the anao that the perceived conflicts of interest of board members are a major risk to tourism australias reputation
2750614 wir leben in zeiten hoher energiepreise da f hrt kein weg zur ck
2750615 es besteht bei den gasunternehmen der dringende verdacht dass es sich um eine missbr uchliche ausnutzung der marktstellung handelt
2750616 we would certainly look forward to hearing about it from canwest given we are tens second largest shareholder
2750617 given we havent heard anything youd think someone would pick up the phone to us if its true
2750618 i think some people are thinking that if they privatise canwest theyll privatise ten hence the share price premium
2750619 even in the case of a privatised major shareholder ten could quite happily go on being listed in australia
2750620 well be launching in perth before we launch in adelaide
2750621 in perth id say at this point well probably launch by late september
2750622 it will cost us several million dollars in each place
2750623 zu einer gemeinsamen eigenst ndigen einkaufsorganisation k nnen wir uns allerdings nicht durchringen
2750624 the fishbein family came up with the idea of giving this trail as a gift
2750625 in 1993 we built our first green building but it didnt create the buzz this building has so we can thank al gore or oil at 140 a barrel our trail has come along at the right time and very much with a purpose
2750626 we wanted to see the composting toilets in any building approved and open to the public
2750627 if small children and international visitors accepted the bathrooms we concluded friends and relatives could accept this idea
2750628 the more we did the more we wanted to do
2750629 this stands as a shining example of what can and should be done in new construction
2750630 this building is very advanced and very functional but has much less of an environmental footprint than any traditional building would
2750631 if we are to live sustainably in the future we really have to change the way we live
2750632 climate change is the number one issue of our time
2750633 at mass audubon we are making a tremendous effort in this area
2750634 seven thousand people in july alone came through this building
2750635 a lot of people were interested in green features and how they could apply them to their own home
2750636 things can be a little more expensive but over time it pays for itself and uses less energy green materials dont have to be renewed and the more and more green materials are produced the price will come down
2750637 it had to grow organically and look like it was part of a whole
2750638 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2750639 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2750640 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2750641 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2750642 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2750643 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2750644 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2750645 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2750646 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2750647 cheated on more times than a blind woman playing scrabble with gypsies
2750648 the one constant in republican victories in fall elections has been large margins in springfield and those surrounding counties
2750649 if you dont campaign hard in a region of the state that is growing that represents a lot of votes
2750650 a good performing republican will get 65 percent of the vote in greene and surrounding counties
2750651 this race will be fought and won in the margins
2750652 if youre a democrat and cant get north of 40 percent in greene county youre in trouble
2750653 a lot of things hes said have really turned off and angered a lot of people including greene county democrats
2750654 the threat of obama is enough to get the hard core conservatives out
2750655 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2750656 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2750657 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2750658 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2750659 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2750660 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
2750661 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2750662 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2750663 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2750664 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2750665 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2750666 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2750667 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2750668 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2750669 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2750670 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2750671 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2750672 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2750673 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2750674 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2750675 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2750676 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2750677 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2750678 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2750679 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2750680 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2750681 is designed to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind
2750682 loony liberalism a kind of ideological m nage a trois between timothy leary karl marx and al gore
2750683 matriarchal environmentalist multicultural anti male anti family anti individual and public hygiene shibboleths are enforced by orwellian regulatory agencies commissions and tribunals better known as the smoke smut seat belt thought language and calorie police
2750684 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2750685 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2750686 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
2750687 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
2750688 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2750689 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2750690 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2750691 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2750692 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2750693 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2750694 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2750695 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2750696 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2750697 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2750698 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2750699 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2750700 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2750701 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
2750702 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
2750703 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
2750704 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
2750705 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
2750706 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
2750707 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2750708 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
2750709 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
2750710 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
2750711 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
2750712 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
2750713 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
2750714 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
2750715 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
2750716 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2750717 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2750718 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2750719 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2750720 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2750721 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2750722 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2750723 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2750724 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2750725 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2750726 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2750727 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2750728 he was absolutely marvellous so prepared so professional so enthusiastic
2750729 i didnt know jean lemire but the fact that it was a canadian piece swung me over to it
2750730 i looked at it and i really loved their work
2750731 they went through trauma and personal anguish and terrible terrible disappointment with what is happening with the world
2750732 oh i hope they get a devastating understanding of what terrible things that we are doing
2750733 just look at the wretched broadcasting in the united states during this presidential campaign its disgusting look what theyre feeding people
2750734 if barack obama is elected president then al gore will be the energy czar in the united states and that i do believe would have a very positive effect
2750735 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2750736 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2750737 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2750738 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2750739 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2750740 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2750741 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2750742 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2750743 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2750744 the jonah factor 13 spiritual steps to finding the job of a lifetime
2750745 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2750746 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2750747 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2750748 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2750749 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2750750 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2750751 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2750752 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2750753 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2750754 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2750755 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2750756 just so you all know we did set a record
2750757 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2750758 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2750759 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2750760 everybody says they want to support it but its been a tough sell
2750761 a number of utilities have reported that only 20 percent to 30 percent of their customers are aware that a green power option is offered
2750762 thats confusing they think its the wind why isnt it free
2750763 what we see in georgia is whats the minimum that we can do well take your money and well green wash and do a lot of propaganda about the program
2750764 10 years behind the curve southern co is looking at offshore wind but theyre not really advancing the ball on renewable energy in a credible or serious way
2750765 as much as 1 billion on renewable generation over the next 10 years
2750766 if they had something in place where they were doing wind turbines on the coast or solar modules or solar plants or something like that i would be more inclined to pay more for that
2750767 but its just really hard for me to justify paying more for landfill methane gas
2750768 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2750769 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2750770 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2750771 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2750772 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2750773 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2750774 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2750775 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2750776 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2750777 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2750778 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2750779 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2750780 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2750781 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

2750783 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2750784 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2750785 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2750786 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2750787 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me

2750790 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
2750791 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
2750792 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
2750793 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
2750794 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
2750795 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
2750796 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
2750797 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2750798 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
2750799 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2750800 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
2750801 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
2750802 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
2750803 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
2750804 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
2750805 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
2750806 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
2750807 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
2750808 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
2750809 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
2750810 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
2750811 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
2750812 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
2750813 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
2750814 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
2750815 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
2750816 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
2750817 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
2750818 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2750819 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2750820 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2750821 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2750822 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2750823 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2750824 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2750825 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2750826 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2750827 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2750828 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2750829 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2750830 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2750831 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2750832 after others learn about this new group kaya natin we can hardworking and ethical local government officials will come out hopefully
2750833 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2750834 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2750835 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2750836 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2750837 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2750838 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2750839 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2750840 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2750841 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2750842 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2750843 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2750844 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2750845 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2750846 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2750847 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2750848 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2750849 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2750850 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
2750851 the only issue that hit home is the war because of him
2750852 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2750853 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2750854 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2750855 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2750856 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2750857 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2750858 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2750859 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2750860 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2750861 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2750862 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2750863 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2750864 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2750865 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2750866 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2750867 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2750868 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2750869 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2750870 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2750871 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2750872 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2750873 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2750874 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2750875 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2750876 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2750877 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2750878 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2750879 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2750880 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2750881 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2750882 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2750883 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2750884 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2750885 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2750886 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2750887 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2750888 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2750889 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2750890 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2750891 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2750892 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2750893 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2750894 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2750895 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2750896 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2750897 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2750898 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2750899 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2750900 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2750901 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2750902 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2750903 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2750904 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2750905 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2750906 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2750907 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2750908 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2750909 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2750910 there you go again thats exactly the politics of division that has led us to where we are in washington
2750911 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2750912 channel 4 will not be in a hurry to commission him poor old durkin again
2750913 it is entirely appropriate that people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2750914 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2750915 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2750916 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2750917 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2750918 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2750919 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2750920 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2750921 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2750922 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2750923 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2750924 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2750925 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2750926 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2750927 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2750928 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2750929 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2750930 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2750931 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2750932 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2750933 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2750934 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2750935 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2750936 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2750937 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2750938 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2750939 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2750940 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2750941 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2750942 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2750943 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2750944 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2750945 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2750946 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2750947 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2750948 although dating is a major preoccupation of the vast number of single twenty and thirtysomethings its hard to think of a group that so completely chooses to live in a neighborhood based on dating opportunities as the citys young orthodox jews and the upper west side an increasingly orthodox enclave has over the past four decades emerged as courting central for modern orthodox singles from across the country and around the world
2750949 if you get to be 23 or 24 and youre not married your parents are going to say you shouldnt be living at home anymore said rabbi allen schwartz of congregation ohab zedek a synagogue on west 95th street near columbus avenue that is heavily attended by young orthodox singles
2750950 baruch november an english professor and poet from pittsburgh who moved to the upper west side five years ago put it this way its like all roads lead to the west side
2750951 but while the upper west side may offer an expanded pool of singles some say its social offerings can distract from the presumed goal of marriage the lifestyle sometimes resembles a relatively chaste version of that depicted in the television series sex and the city featuring below the knee designer skirts and kosher wine in place of cosmopolitans
2750952 hey guys is it getting hot in here lemme just take off my shirt

2750956 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2750957 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2750958 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan

2750962 i thought we were going to a sit down restaurant
2750963 umm i dont think we can make it in time can we move it to 8pm
2750964 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2750965 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2750966 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2750967 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2750968 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2750969 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2750970 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2750971 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere

2751003 you start to feel a level of responsibility to direct attention to things that actually matter more than to silly things like who youre dating

2751037 what started us looking at this issue is the fact that senator mccain has declared his intention to maintain us forces in iraq for a hundred years
2751038 that means that mccain wants to control babylon for at least a century
2751039 we believe that the end times is near based on the pattern of wars earthquakes and other strange phenomena weve been witnessing since the start of the new millennium
2751040 given that it may be imminent the person who controls babylon must be the antichrist
2751041 what clinched it for us was that the name mihai means who is like the lord
2751042 as far as were concerned that was enough it means that mccain might easily pretend to be the redeemer
2751043 many people think that the antichrist will be a evil seeming leader but in fact the bible tells us that he will be charming
2751044 if a law is unjust a man is not only right to disobey it

2751054 some of the bloggers have been very complimentary but they all say we want that trip planner that is a common denominator of what everyone is looking for next
2751055 its indicative of just how much people care about the ttc it really is the nerve centre of the city
2751056 theyre providing a service to people who use the ttc and thats fine
2751057 in the meantime if there are other resources on the web that people want to create or tap into
2751058 sometimes if youre going down the yonge line and you want to go west it sends you round the loop
2751059 one day i was looking up a bus schedule and said wow this is a really bad interface
2751060 despite the fact that i published the first reports over a year ago the ttc has never bothered to talk to me about them
2751061 in every case what the fans put together isnt perfect after all were not being paid for any of this but we do decent work on a pro bono basis showing what the ttc could do if it tried
2751062 i think theres been a lot of value coming from this public input

2751081 this is not an appropriate area for judges to go into
2751082 yes eyewitness id across races has its issues but is there a rampant problem to the degree that we need to get judges to start telling juries this is the law no

2751099 si somos ratificados debemos esperar los resultados mi deseo es que haya una gran unidad del pueblo boliviano
2751100 lucha por su unidad por su igualdad y por su identidad
2751101 las comisiones seguir n funcionando durante los recesos del congreso y los de la propia c mara en el despacho de los asuntos a su cargo
2751102 es alarmante ver c mo la reforma petrolera es el pretexto para no tocar otros temas importantes debemos hacer nuestro trabajo con responsabilidad y citar a comisiones
2751103 quiz sea el tema m s trascendente que traiga entre manos el senado sin lugar a dudas porque lo que se decida en funci n de la industria petrolera ser clave para 107 millones de mexicanos pero de ninguna manera es el nico
2751104 no son vacaciones es receso del pleno no de las comisiones
2751105 no podemos medir la e ciencia del congreso por el n mero de veces que reformamos la ley hay veces que las batallas se ganan no reform ndola tengamos eso muy claro para evitar confusi n
2751106 creo que los recesos no son vacaciones no hay sesiones en el pleno pero s es un periodo en el que se pueden sacar puntos de acuerdo e iniciativas pendientes

2751111 i wasnt riding under perfect conditions as we definitely had a few issues this weekend
2751112 but we were able to get them sorted for the most part i spent quite a bit of time on the phone with eric dorn from edr performance trying to find solutions and we were at the track till late on saturday night wrenching but all in all it was a good weekend
2751113 and i wanted to focus on the supersport race so i opted out of fx it was a good decision on my part
2751114 i was hoping to have someone to really race against but it was fun regardless i worked on staying nice and relaxed and on some of the techniques keith code was helping me with over the weekend
2751115 im extremely happy with a 23rd place finish and want to thank my fianc e john parker who worked tirelessly all weekend all of our team sponsors and all of our fans
2751116 i was so disappointed that i didnt make the cut
2751117 this was a big race and i was excited to be here during the grand prix weekend i felt like i let everyone down i just found it tough with so little practice time to get everything sorted out in time
2751118 i went faster in qualifying after working with keith and coming up with a plan for areas that i was struggling with
2751119 it just wasnt fast enough ill make it up at the next race weekend in mid ohio ill do well there
2751120 when chaz went by he sucked me into turn two faster than i had gone before and i tried to stay with him for a while it was awesome
2751121 overall it was a fun race my first at this track and im happy with my finish id like to thank all my sponsors as well as john parker michael pesicka adam fetter and deb barton for their help at the track this weekend
2751122 i like your christ i do not like your christians

2751128 by completing this development program we have demonstrated that lor 2040 can be given safely with this new route of administration
2751129 the results of these studies provide further confirmation of the high safety profile seen with lor 2040 and of the potential utility of this drug for the treatment of bladder cancer i am pleased that we are on schedule to advance lor 2040 for the treatment of this indication
2751130 the drop in oil price has come at the expense of supply security
2751131 but on the other hand any drop in market security in the form of spare capacity is highly detrimental to consumers we need excess capacity to guarantee supply security
2751132 for the past month ive been receiving so much treatment and ive been doing everything to recover after montreal where i really wasnt able to play after there it was so painful
2751133 on saturday we flew an osteopath in from sydney to help with my hand ive had really great doctors to help and weve tried all kind of treatments nothing could get my hand ready to play and it was one of the hardest decisions of my career
2751134 this kind of injury takes time and thats just what i didnt have enough of im very disappointed but im young and will have another chance
2751135 i dont want to put my hopes too high but its definitely something that i want to recover for

2751169 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2751170 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2751171 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2751172 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2751173 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2751174 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2751175 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2751176 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

2751188 there are many valid reasons why women who have had abortions at the fredericton clinic would not or could not bring this challenge
2751189 dr morgentaler is therefore a suitable alternative person to do so
2751190 i really wish they would just let the process go through well win the whole thing is very unconstitutional theyre violating the canada health act and women dont have equal access to abortion in this province they do not
2751191 i think it is most unlikely the people of new brunswick will ever pay morgentaler to kill our provinces unborn babies on demand
2751192 our province needs to stand firm in this matter and i am very hopeful it will do so

2751212 everyone was just running down the street it was like something from a movie

2751215 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2751216 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2751217 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2751218 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations

2751254 hes a real modest guy kind of a quiet guy
2751255 pretty much everyone on the team has a chance to medal at something
2751256 we definitely have a chance to be the best but its all talk until you go out and do it
2751257 i think its great for the sport to have someone like him whos creating all this hype and really getting the sport out there
2751258 it is this simple fact that trust is a real dynamic element in eve that causes the in game player interaction to be vastly more political and intriguing than other games from the smallest level of two mission runners to the largest levels of 0 0 mega alliances the ultimate question becomes who do you trust in this game how do you know you can trust them and how can you be sure youve earned theirs

2751291 n o criamos muitas oportunidades mas encaixamos bem a marca o sofremos o gol em um lance que a bola desviou no zagueiro e voltamos para o segundo tempo confiantes de que poder amos manter o que feito no primeiro tempo mas sofremos o gol de p nalti e depois a equipe se desorganizou um pouco

2751310 such things are very unusual not just in this area but all of beijing i am shocked i am very shocked this is tragic
2751311 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2751312 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families
2751313 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others

2751353 giles exercised a clause in his contract friday morning and nixed any possibility of a trade

2751359 there are thousands of stories i could share with you about how awesome little frank was how genuine he was he was a happy smart child never one sad day in his life he lived every day long and played hard we could not have prayed for a better addition to our family this child loved so many people and brought so much joy to those around him he had his parents grandparents and brother and sister wrapped around his finger one day will not pass that i will not think of the joy he brought to the world
2751360 he loved school so much he loved his friends he would talk about his buddies constantly when i would pick him up he would hug each one of them the love that surrounded him at sbec was surreal i have never seen a child love to go to school so much each day when i would pick him up he always save me his cookies in his lunch box so we would drive away and we would figure out the fairest way to sort out his cookies frank has an infectious flirty smile he could make anyone do anything he wanted to do frankie brooks frank was an adorable little guy with a mischievous good humored grin his bright blue eyes which he inherited from his grandpa and namesake frank inspired his k 3 teacher mrs greer to nickname him frankie blue eyes
2751361 someone had said there were beer bottles in his vehicle he didnt say a word to anyone
2751362 my mother cries daily my son is not sleeping at night anymore my daughter is higher strung and is in constant need of affection we feel like the walking dead my friends are a large part of my life and a friend of mine said he feels like we are all raped that is what it feels like to an outsider this child made people that happy
2751363 truthfully i basically have no will to live anymore i am just going through the motions dealing with work and trying to be strong for my family i only see an unhappy life for the rest of my life my mom is pretty dramatic and i always told her well at least we are all healthy and no one sick or died i even told her that a few weeks before this happened i have never cared much about material items and now i feel that i am being punished by god since i do not care about money and items like this he will take away the only thing in my life i did care about my family a loss of one child has made my entire world come down
2751364 the archbishops council met last week to propose a solution
2751365 everyone agrees roadside litter is unsightly and clearing it up from the roadside takes up valuable resources that could be used elsewhere
2751366 we want everyone to help us keep englands roads clear by getting into the habit of keeping a bag in their vehicle to store their rubbish until they can find a bin for it
2751367 with rubbish theres no such place as away every piece of litter tossed onto the carriageway has to be picked up by someone
2751368 we have an invasion of illegal immigrants who have committed crimes and pass through the courthouse every day my liberal opponent does nothing to identify the people who are in our country illegally committing crimes then processed by sheriff terry johnson through the 287 g program
2751369 i pledge to identify and process illegal aliens who are violating our laws through the ice program here in alamance county this is not just federal law enforcements job its the job of all our public servants
2751370 thats the role that the judges play and thats what we do on a daily basis
2751371 i think mr whited has a misunderstanding about what district court judges do and doesnt come to district court very often
2751372 i think he needs to run for congress or for the state legislature or for the county commissioners he does not have a clear understanding of the role of a district court judge with the things he said in that letter
2751373 doesnt have any idea what goes on in my courtroom
2751374 i handle my job very diligently as do the other district court judges were following the law that we were sworn to uphold
2751375 its a judges responsibility as a sworn officer of the court to uphold the law
2751376 the role of a judge is to be a fact finder given the evidence presented to them and to render a decision based on that
2751377 i would like everybody to focus on their role i dont think the public wants the judge to be an investigator
2751378 judges are required to follow all of the law not some part of it
2751379 has tried to identify whether the people he puts on probation are here validly
2751380 public can ask us both the same questions at the same time
2751381 it is important at least to me that the law be followed in a fair and efficient manner
2751382 i would think that he would join me in a commitment to follow all of the law i hope that he does
2751383 but that little provision about ensuring that defendants that are put on probation follow the federal law is important its important for the voters to know the difference between judge lambeth and myself
2751384 its a really personal story and i thank ingrid for trusting me to make it
2751385 ive taken it as an opportunity to start over although i lost copies of all my early films and my personal possessions in the fire
2751386 you cant make a film about a frumpy middle aged woman

2751449 you can track every bag of coffee every diamond to a specific diamond field but for gold theres nothing
2751450 if i have one wish its that i might someday have a little bit of money
2751451 sometimes i dream that one day ill own something made of gold
2751452 from the veteran communitys point of view he is not the person we want in the job
2751453 he is representing veterans and our history and our contribution
2751454 during the vietnam war he left australia then actively campaigned against the war in the uk saying it was a sad day when the viet cong was defeated this is the guy weve got to deal with and thats not good enough
2751455 we would not consider him an appropriate person to be doing veterans affairs
2751456 his views on conscription at the time of the vietnam conflict are well known and were indeed shared by many other australians both at the time and across the spectrum of australian military and political history
2751457 estou animado com a perspectiva de fazer outras coisas no pr ximo ano

2751467 i spoke with kaka yesterday saturday we know that the clubs are talking about the transfer although they have not reached a conclusion yet
2751468 i think an august transfer is still a possibility though kaka will only talk about that when they do a deal
2751469 he is waiting for a deal and then he will start to negotiate with chelsea normally milan do not sell their best players we think they like the proposal but it is not so easy for them to accept it
2751470 we know that the clubs are talking about the transfer although they have not reached a conclusion yet
2751471 i think an august transfer is still a possibility though kaka will only talk about that when they do a deal
2751472 he is waiting for a deal and then he will start to negotiate with chelsea
2751473 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2751474 do you hear my kids screaming get the ear plugs because im parenting my children teaching them i will do what i say i will do i tend to take toys away when they dont clean them up i dont abuse them if you think otherwise come spend a day at my house be thankful im teaching them lessons like this and im actually doing my job as mom there is no need to call the cops everytime i make a parenting decision cause time is being wasted for them to come out here to find no abuse going on
2751475 its only four days down the track so we are holding out hope
2751476 what weve done is conduct a surface search of the river to eradicate that possibility from the investigation
2751477 if we can stop the signal for the proliferation of uncontrolled growth of the cells then we can stop the leukemia in its tracks
2751478 normally in drug design it would be 15 years from start to finish but because of the nature of the surface we have to split apart the way ahead is antibodies and that is very straightforward technology
2751479 so i would expect the drug development would be a lot faster
2751480 not only is this a very important protein involved in disease the structure shows immediately how we can design drugs to treat the disease
2751481 im not going to indicate what may or may not have been discussed at cabinet but our position is quite straightforward we dont support the use of capital punishment
2751482 when an australian overseas has been convicted and is subject to capital punishment as a sentence we make representations on behalf of australian citizens when it comes to other individuals who arent australian citizens well make a judgment on a case by case basis as to whether its appropriate to make representations or to join in representations at a regional or multilateral level
2751483 but the prime minister and i have both made clear that we dont propose to make representations on behalf of terrorists who have been subject to the death penalty
2751484 so i wont be making any individual representations so far as the bali bombers are concerned
2751485 ill be just making the point in our formal bilateral conversation in jakarta tomorrow that we have three of the bali nine still subject to the death penalty
2751486 ill make inquiries about the progress of their cases through the indonesian legal and judicial system and again make the point that when those processes have been completed that if any of those three still remain the subject of the death penalty well be making a plea for clemency in accordance with our normal processes
2751487 yes that was the danger of skilfully prepared intoxicating drinks the word intoxicating adequately expressed their power their menace to orderly monotonous resignation a word i thought further debased by moralists from its primary ecstatic content intoxication with ron bacardi with may with passion was a state threatening to privilege abhorrent to authority and since the dull were so fatally in the majority they had succeeded in attaching a heavy penalty to whatever lay outside their lymphatic understanding they had as well made the term gay an accusation before their lord confounding it with loose so that now a gay girl certainly the only girl worth a ribbon or the last devotion was one bearing upon her graceful figure for she was apt to be reprehensibly graceful the censure of a society open to any charge other than that of gaiety in either of its meanings a ridiculous a tragic conclusion i told myself indifferently but then with a fresh daiquiri and a sprig of orange blossoms in my buttonhole it meant less than nothing
2751488 oh no he not only shagged another woman while his wife was sick but he didnt use birth control either
2751489 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2751490 is this guy really going to cross right in front of us
2751491 alle v bnede georgiske styrker er trukket v k fra konfliktzonen
2751492 that is one homeless person down now if only they would all take care of each other so that those of us who work and pay taxes can enjoy our city honestly they have time to have sex love triangles and make all kinds of friends and sex partners they could find time to get jobs at least now this one woman has another solution to the homeless problem
2751493 ok lets recap in the heart of center city we have two homeless woment fighting for the affection of another homeless guy and one kills the other they have the energy to kill but not to work
2751494 get them off the street enough is enough the rubbish the crime the exposing of themsleves and the filth this is an easy solution enforce the no camping these people dont want help they want to have teh right to live on our streets and our parks have sex fornicate and relieve themselves in public how long does this city need to be subjected to this
2751495 people have themselves to blame for homelessness and for all the breeding done by people who cant support their offspring none of the people out ruining the city by peeing on the streets harassing taxpayes and now killing themselves are going to contribute to society in a meaningful way they are violating our social contract so dont blame the rest of us curtis when my house had a rodent problem we took measures to protect our belongings and called an exterminator we didnt look for ways to help the rodents coexist
2751496 give a person a fish feed him for a day teach him to fish feed him for a lifetime

2751503 in australia weve traditionally had a breadwinner model where one full time worker could support a family
2751504 now most families with two full time wage earners stay above the poverty line but those with just one are in poverty
2751505 theyd rather pay out the crooks than pay out their workers
2751506 the hardest bit is telling people ive been knocked back sometimes i wonder if its because i became the poster boy of it all
2751507 victoria police is pleased that it has been able to work with the police association to finalise the claims

2751510 such infrastructure may perversely perpetuate the oil vulnerability of australias outer suburban regions at great cost
2751511 such schemes will largely direct new investment to central and middle suburban areas yet these are the zones that are already well served by high quality public transport infrastructure as reflected in the high use of these services by residents
2751512 it is time for action now the state government needs to start building railway extensions into growth corridors and ease the financial strain on people living in the outer suburbs

2751515 human culture as we have known it for the past 200 years is drawing to a close a revolution of civilization is upon us prepare
2751516 the most significant characteristic of modern civilization is the sacrifice of the future for the present and all the power of science has been prostituted to this purpose
2751517 nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could only do a little
2751518 such small variations in demand or supply cannot explain such price changes
2751519 demand is down in the us prices will go down back to normal
2751520 there are a lot of good ideas that cant be put into practice
2751521 attendance has been turned into endorsement and endorsement without significant progress in exchange is wrong
2751522 i think unfortunately a lot of countries say well if we say that we are not going to the opening ceremonies weve checked the box on tibet thats a cop out
2751523 politics invited itself into sports we didnt call for politics to come
2751524 the olympic brand is extremely strong because of one overriding factor the people of the world want to find a place where there is unity
2751525 tell them that whatever they have seen and heard the games will be very well organized
2751526 tell them that we will rebound from this current crisis
2751527 the venues of the games are not a place for proactive political or religious expression
2751528 sanctions and penalties will be applied in any cases considered to be a breach of ioc policy
2751529 the belgian olympic committee announced that it will not permit its athletes to make political statements verbally or sartorially that must mean tibetan armbands
2751530 given chinas mighty economic power nobody really wants to antagonize beijing
2751531 we believe the olympic games are not the place for demonstrations and we hope that all people attending the games recognize the importance of this
2751532 it appears that most sponsors have made the decision to refrain from criticizing beijing rather than risk angering the chinese government another world class understatement
2751533 no other dictatorship has ever had more power in the united states
2751534 it would be a deadly insult and humiliation to an insecure government that would not forgive or forget
2751535 without security guarantees there cannot be a successful olympic games and without security guarantees the national image will be lost
2751536 we have to have a good olympics otherwise not only will our generation lose face but also our ancestors
2751537 what is dvd and you will see the dvd structure format and specifications
2751538 there are no words to describe the terrible suffering of my people at this moment the chinese government is relentlessly crushing the tibetan people when they desire nothing more than the restoration of their basic rights and freedom tibetans are being killed silenced and marginalized our precious religion strangled as the chinese government attempts to extinguish all trace of tibetan identity i am protesting today to tell the world that while it stares mesmerized at chinas olympic games my people are being crushed under the boot of chinese oppression
2751539 ich wollte einfach nur rausgehen und spa haben und den haben wir gehabt
2751540 die freude von ditte war ansteckend da ist der funke dann bergesprungen
2751541 sie durften beim letzten sprung nicht den kleinsten fehler machen diese situation haben sie brillant gel st

2751543 der erfolg ist die initialz ndung f r die gesamte mannschaft
2751544 we saw him leave but in the olympics it could be anything it could be to talk to reporters it could be a problem with tickets and logistics of practices we didnt know
2751545 so it wasnt until after we got our therapy when we had our meetings and we saw a lot of people show up that we knew something was wrong we havent seen him since he left the room
2751546 hes the guy whos been steering leading our squad through these last four years
2751547 i know the guys it meant an awful lot to us when we heard from him he talked about trying to move on each of us has to try to move on in our own way
2751548 our knee jerk reactions were like any other human beings we were angry we were upset
2751549 we wanted to talk to our friends and family who are here and back home we met as a team as a male sport we tend to hide our feelings a lot
2751550 but there was definitely a moment where guys let off how they felt about the situation how they felt about hugh not being on the bench
2751551 as soon as the rubber meets the road he has to make a decision
2751552 id much rather be sitting on the bench telling him what i think he should be doing and having him saying i dont think so rather than where i am right now
2751553 we wanted to do something with our jerseys but we didnt have time so we put wizs moms initials and dads initials on the back of our shoes and just talked about huddling up together taking a couple of moments to let him know that were thinking about him
2751554 its been very emotional for us the last 24 hours obviously
2751555 were playing a volleyball game out there nothing in comparison to the loss that happened to our team usa volleyball our whole delegation obviously we all came here to do this and its very hard to continue on
2751556 to feel that feeling of helplessness we just kind of talked and thought the best thing we can do is go out and play volleyball
2751557 just a shake of the hips and people literally fall on their face trying to chase this guy down
2751558 at this time we are happy with our agent and not looking for another one
2751559 no new uses have been identifed at this time but clearly its a very strategic location
2751560 its right next to the convention center it is the crossroads or transition from downtown to the oregon district so its location is very important
2751561 theo is ready to take on more responsibility he has the support from the fans the club and his team mates
2751562 he is one of the best players in the squad the only thing he has to improve is an aspect of his character
2751563 hes a very lovely guy maybe too lovely on the pitch
2751564 i keep saying to him he has to become more nasty after this he will be one of the best players in the premier league
2751565 i believe im a good example i came from a small club in spain and when you are young at a club like arsenal it can be difficult
2751566 but if you use all the facilities on offer and have the determination you would be stupid not to improve
2751567 un mare calmo lincoscienza e ho bisogno di te pazienza che strani giorni amore si muovono le nuvole onde a toccare il cielo davanti a noi dammi le tue mani sei entrato senza far rumore hai preso tutte le parole ed hai sprecato ogni mia forza e darsi tutto e farsi male e andare a fondo a fondo per cercare chiss se avremo unoccasione ancora un cambio di stagione io benedico la tua assenza e resta addosso il male e il bene nascondo tutto tutto nelle vene arriver domani
2751568 sar il tempo a dire che stai benissimo cos certi sbagli fanno crescere non fanno male pochi giorni e tutto torner normale ma non svaniranno mai resteranno sempre i tuoi ricordi di un anno momenti che ti lasciano un sorriso ricordi le risate tra di noi mille discussioni e istanti di follia no non svaniranno mai resteranno sempre i tuoi soltanto tuoi ricordi bellissimi pensieri e sensazioni che ti danno ricordi

2751618 my wife told me about the text message what did you do
2751619 just what the message say i did talked with the other woman
2751620 the girl decided to go ahead and call me because she was told by
2751621 and i get hot cause i dont like people putting words into my mouth
2751622 so im already trying to watch where i step here because this so called relationship im in is cracked with a gap that gets bigger and bigger as more time goes by without seeing each other so i tell the other girl look i have no problems with you whatsoever we cool me and mines we trying to work things out and whatever so we talk for a while longer like an hour or two trying to catch up then when we get off the phone i call my girlfriend let her know we need to talk nothing about what the other girl said because that was being messy if it was true but you know you suppose to give yours the benefit of the doubt before you point fingers so i called her and left a message saying that all this time we havent seen each is taking its toll i cant ever pull her away from family and when she gives me her word about how shes going to see me the day usually ends with an apology we were supposed to go see the mummy i drive all the way out to her theater thats maybe five minutes away from her home which is like 45 minutes from me and she calls me and says she cant make it because she is really sleepy and falling asleep in the car i had been sitting in the parking lot for like 10 15 minutes already i was very angry that night i couldve broken up with her and not given it a second thought she didnt call me that night because i think she knew how i felt its like her word is absolutely no good to me
2751623 yeah you got more patience than me cause that would have been a wrap believe that lil momma wouldve had to go
2751624 its really been four weeks since you last saw her
2751625 yes talk talk about the lies she was telling the other girl i had never said about her i mean cmon picture me calling a woman the b word
2751626 man i said if you going to break up and accuse and talk to me like that have a legitimate reason
2751627 you know olgirl has her boyfriend right now and for the moment ad shook his head and said
2751628 but you was right on one thing you said long ago when you was unsure about all of this time tells everything and now you know do you think that its over between you two
2751629 im not going to say yes or no because ive learned to never claim the future but things would have to change so maybe so maybe not im not looking forward to it right now this isnt the worse that could happen to me but i tell you i absolutely need no drama and a relationship that starts with a friend and escalates slowly anything worth having is something worth waiting for
2751630 i tell you the stories you bring me i dont know why you hadnt wrote a book yet
2751631 when i came in they said they werent sure and so i said ill take it
2751632 you just blast it on goal and see where it lands it worked
2751633 we were very close to being in the quarterfinals and now we are very far
2751634 before the game nobody gave us a chance and i think we played pretty good you can look at this as half empty or half full
2751635 in the dying seconds well maybe not the dying seconds to get a goal for 2 2 were not a real team were still a lot of individual players

2751640 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2751641 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2751642 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2751643 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2751644 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2751645 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2751646 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2751647 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2751654 this was pretty fun i went out at 9am went up and down twice and grabbed a free helmet on the way home i live a block over on lexington and i gotta say that ive never seen it so crowded before but its not all that bad really its just never that crowded at all in the 20s
2751655 to search all houses for contrabands and fire arms and that wherever they found either they will set fire to the house
2751656 they took all blacks they could find even little children

2751658 contrabands are arriving here constantly and it really is a distressing sight to see women and children huddled in wagons bringing all their worldly possessions with them
2751659 visited the battlefield three days after the fight and it made me sick the bodies were so numerous and so swelled up and some so shot to pieces a foot here an arm there and a head in another place they lay so thick in the valley of death that you couldnt walk on the ground their flesh was black as your hat yes black as the blackest colored person
2751660 basil biggs had the contract to raise the dead and put them into coffins he had a two horse team and hauled six at a time every particle of the body was gathered up and the grave neatly closed over and leveled the bodies were found in various stages of decomposition they were generally covered up with a small portion of earth dug up from alongside the body

2751665 i am not quite sure what all the stephen ireland rumour is about
2751666 there was a bit of confusion about stephen before the game against milan but i had a word with him before the game and explained my interpretation of it it has been sorted out and i explained my understanding of it
2751667 at this time of the year a lot of agents are flying around and at times some are of a view that they can start to exercise some interest in their clients
2751668 anything we have said in regards of stephen has been misinterpreted and people have run away with it

2751688 i kind of expected that with the preliminaries at night and the finals in the morning
2751689 its due to many developments like in swimsuits and in technology and pools
2751690 i wasnt exerting myself at all i wasnt even puffing at the end
2751691 i was watching all the heats yesterday and saw how fast the mens breaststroke was and the womens fly were exceptionally fast
2751692 it just was so hard to make a semi i wasnt sure what ours was going to be like so i sort of mentally prepared for that as well that it wasnt going to be easy tonight i couldnt just cruise
2751693 i was very surprised ive never swam that fast before i dropped tenths of seconds off my best time
2751694 i think i was the european record holder for about a minute but ill take that
2751695 im actually a 200 breaststroker so im not worried about not having enough for tomorrow nobody expected me to contend in the 100 not me not my coach but here i am
2751696 not so good im going to have to concentrate more tomorrow
2751697 its prelims just go through but in the evening people are in a lot better shape in the morning people dont go their seed times

2751705 esto me hizo pensar qu pasar a si lo mas parecido a un humano que quedara en el universo fuera una m quina esta fue realmente la chispa que ya ha recorrido un largo camino

2751707 various landmarks in the united states including new york city
2751708 chemical substances in gel and liquid form that were sealed in bottles and glass jars
2751709 the united states did not have knowledge of her whereabouts until she was detained by the afghan police on july 17
2751710 ms siddiqui was not in custody of the united states either at bagram air base in afghanistan or anywhere else at any time prior to her detention on july 17
2751711 any rumors or allegations to the contrary are absolutely baseless and without any credible foundation whatsoever
2751712 im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2751713 the first time he kissed her he should have been thinking goodbye to my political career
2751714 feel invulnerable that they feel it has gone on all of the time that im not going to be scrutinized at this level and it will stay private
2751715 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2751716 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2751717 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2751718 i dont know what causes one to cross a bright line like this one but its probably going to haunt him for the rest of his life its colossal
2751719 fair evaluation for america to engage in to look at what kind of human beings each of us are and what kind of president wed make
2751720 i liked him before but i dont see any integrity
2751721 the image of him and his wife was very important the image of that union
2751722 i have great things to say about john edwards he opened that window up for our rural community
2751723 it gave something to our community and our students and their families
2751724 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2751725 i understand that this is a difficult and painful time to them and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2751726 obviously it turns a defining element of his biography his reputation as a devoted family man upside down
2751727 but if he shows a continued commitment to his core issues and no additional facts emerge that contradict his story he could eventually join the disturbingly large club of public figures whove rebounded from similar events
2751728 i dont think anythings ended my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2751729 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2751730 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2751731 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2751732 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2751733 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2751734 credit to germany they were very clinical and took their chances very well but the scale of the defeat hurts a great deal
2751735 i think the players know we were off our game in a few areas and we will look hard at that
2751736 it was disappointing because we unpicked them at times and it was just scoring those chances when we had them

2751746 given his exemplary lifestyle including meticulous eating habits it is difficult to understand on the surface why he would have become a victim of heart disease
2751747 i have probably had stomach infections for 20 years unbeknown to me that is certainly when my symptoms started dave helped me to clear it within 3 months of non side effects herbs and am now taking matula tea to help with bowel health i believe dave said this clears h pylor is well dave is the only person who has improved my bowel health in all this time i have tried everything else to no avail i believe in him and trust him implicitly now to help me to gain full health again having the lab tests to take the guess work out of things has been a great bonus for me
2751748 when i contacted you i felt as if there was no hope and i would eventually die
2751749 it is very difficult trying to make sense of the information out there

2751757 persoalannya komodifikasi kerap digarap dengan mengabaikan logika dan rasionalitas hanya memberikan hiburan sesaat menebarkan harapan kosong atau malah mendorong orang berjudi di tengah pendidikan masyarakat yang relatif rendah layanan itu bisa membuat bangsa ini makin konsumtif dan jadi obyek permainan industri kapitalisme saja
2751758 gejala ini bisa menggerogoti produktivitas etos kerja serta mengurangi kemampuan orang melihat persoalan yang substansial karena telanjur diharu biru oleh permukaan
2751759 saya ingin berbagi renungan hidup dari bacaan pengalaman dan gagasan yang saya pikirkan semoga itu bisa memperkaya dan memberi alternatif di tengah banyak sms yang main main hasilnya untuk fund rising lembaga pendidikan di aceh
2751760 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy

2751791 silence makes us vulnerable because when we stop making noise we lose control who knows what thoughts or feelings might arise if we turned off the television or stopped yammering for a while laughter makes us vulnerable because it often comes in response to our flaws and foibles who knows how foolish we might look when the joke is on us we can share silence and laughter only when we trust each other and the more often we share them the deeper our trust grows the soul loves silence because it is shy and silence helps it feel safe the soul loves laughter because it seeks truth and laughter often reveals reality

2751800 one thing i ask of the lord this is what i seek
2751801 isnt it funny how often it is that god asks us to do the one thing that we really really dont want to do
2751802 from one man he made every nation of men that they should inhabit the whole earth and he determined the exact places where they should live god did this s o that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him though he is not far from each one of us

2751807 on coming back to america for furlough after four years in bosnia im impressed with the unbelievable amount of blessings god has given the american church in the way of preachers teachers seminaries bible translations christian books cds tapes etc my heart cries out for some of these blessings to be shared with the less privileged people and small church in bosnia on behalf of that small country with 800 believers and very few biblical resources in their language i feel like begging and pleading with my american brothers and sisters to share the blessings i am also burdened with the observation that it is so easy in america to forget the fact that we should be living with eternity in view every time we are tempted to spend an hour on tv or a movie or waste a buck on pet care or luxuries may we be reminded that our time and treasures will last much longer if we invest them in the things of eternity making disciples for christ

2751818 es evidente que hay un copamiento aprista recordemos lo que dijo agust n mantilla en el 2006 el nombramiento de arana es la consolidaci n de lo dicho por mantilla y eso es peligroso porque el dinero de los programas sociales puede ser utilizado con fines electorales como la campa a presidencial de jorge del castillo en el 2011
2751819 pensando en las elecciones municipales regionales y en el 2011 hay toda una estrategia de copamiento el apra quiere mantenerse en el poder a perpetuidad ahora que hay dinero en los programas sociales
2751820 en lugar de coparlos pol ticamente se deber a generar mayor eficiencia en el gasto parece que hay soberbia y el absoluto convencimiento de que no hay nadie que pueda opinar diferente
2751821 se trata a la vista de una suerte de copamiento partidario en el aparato estatal que m s bien tiene que ser provisto de personal m s id neo que tenga capacidad para dirigir con mucho cuidado las instituciones que pertenecen al pa s y que no le pertenecen a ning n partido

2751866 i am very happy to get a hundred it was one of the most difficult hundreds to get we now want to keep them india well below the 100 mark when we go out there tomorrow
2751867 its disappointing that we have not performed as a batting unit these are the guys who have won games for india its just a matter of not clicking i dont know how it happened
2751868 its a good wicket to bat on and i hope we bat well tomorrow we are looking forward to a good partnership in the morning
2751869 all the gold that leaves our village is headed to mali to this one man
2751870 he has the means to take it out we dont
2751871 for a long time hes worked with the white people
2751872 we dont live in the bush so we have nothing to do with child labor
2751873 i can assure you that what he declares is only a fraction of what is going out
2751874 if i am wrong you can cut off my head and put it on a platter
2751875 i buy some grams some kilos from here and there
2751876 service or even accept gold from a mine where children work
2751877 it comes from africa and it arrives in the swiss banks thats all you need to know
2751878 there is a desire to deal with this but the question is how
2751879 home depot can track every 2 by 4 to its forest of origin
2751880 you can track every bag of coffee every diamond to a specific diamond field but for gold theres nothing
2751881 if i have one wish its that i might someday have a little bit of money
2751882 sometimes i dream that one day ill own something made of gold
2751883 democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal rather than religion specific values it requires that their proposals be subject to argument and amenable to reason i may be opposed to abortion for religious reasons but if i seek to pass a law banning the practice i cannot simply point to the teachings of my church or evoke gods will i have to explain why abortion violates some principle that is accessible to people of all faiths including those with no faith at all
2751884 jesus christ never intended any person to sport all he hats the present day pastor is expected to wear he never intended any one person to bear such a load
2751885 the full and unequivocal repeal of the federal defense of marriage act
2751886 ensure that the 1 100 federal legal rights and benefits
2751887 do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman that is an abomination
2751888 because of this god gave them over to shameful lusts even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones in the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another men committed indecent acts with other men and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion
2751889 i do not agree with general pace that homosexuality is immoral
2751890 the fact remains with no provision to protect the heath of the mother this ban on a legitimate medical procedure is clearly unconstitutional and must be overturned
2751891 keep the bush team from appointing the supreme court justice that will vote against roe v wade
2751892 w hat were really saying is in fact that they babies who survive abortions are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a child a 9 month old child that was delivered to term the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this a baby who survives an abortion is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute for that purpose i think it would probably be found unconstitutional
2751893 how doctrinaire must one be to defend actual infanticide what in the life affirming judeo christian value system could possibly give license to kill live babies
2751894 if our leaders cannot be trusted to defend the weakest among us they simply cannot be trusted in any other area of public trust
2751895 why if christianity is true and claims to change lives do we see so little evidence of that transformation in the lives of christians
2751896 what strategy or program will work best to revitalize this church
2751897 do we even have the correct vision for what our church ought to be in the first place
2751898 you can take some people out of the old stale church but you cant take the old stale church out of some people
2751899 mr myers i respectfully ask you to share with me on what grounds you object to this mans treatment of is daughter you seem to be appealing to me to agree with you about how vile this man is based upon some shared sense of fairness or decency that he has supposedly violated what is the source of that shared standard you are appealing to me to agree with you based on or have i misunderstood you randy
2751900 for the first time mankind will be using energy not derived from the sun
2751901 another objection is the waste that nuclear power is supposed to produce spent fuel rods are 95 u 235 or about the same amount as in a shovel full of dirt
2751902 reactor grade uranium is only 3 u 235 bomb grade uranium that kind that can explode must be enriched to 90 u 235
2751903 of the remaining 5 most is recycled and useful for other things medicine etc leaving a very small amount that needs to be stored in special repositories like yucca mountain
2751904 another objection to nuclear power is the supposed waste it produces but this is a mischaracterization a spent fuel rod is 95 u 235 this is the same material we can find in a shovel full of dirt from our back yards of the remaining 5 most is useful but small amounts should probably be placed in a repository such as yucca mountain
2751905 de kristne hevder og har ogs klart gj re det til en allmenn oppfatning ogs blant ikke kristne at jesus virkelig har eksistert at det finnes uavhengige historiske beviser for hans eksistens
2751906 moderne kritiske metoder st tter ikke at jesus bare var en myte p standene om dette har igjen og igjen blitt besvart og avvist av de mest fremst ende forskere i de senere rene er det f om noen seri se historikere som har fors kt hevde at det ikke har v rt noen historisk jesus de som har pr vd seg p dette har ikke lykkes i bortforklare de sv rt mye sterkere til og med rikelige bevisene p det motsatte
2751907 archaya s sporer kildene til historiene om jesus langt lenger tilbake i tiden enn to tusen r de er egentlig gjendiktning og forvrenginger av paganistiske skapelseshistorier
2751908 its fairly common sometimes happens with infection sometimes happens with trauma to him it happened between resting and walking in the opening ceremonies
2751909 though molinas condition sounds frightening it wasnt caused by boxing and should heal on its own but it was yet another obstacle for a team thats already gone through the drama of luis yanezs banishment and reinstatement to the team before beijing followed by bantamweight gary russell jr
2751910 i felt kind of sluggish all night i knew what i had to do and i just didnt do it i just wasnt feeling comfortable
2751911 i think what we saw was a young man in there with a grown man
2751912 i fought him in the world championships and he did the exact same thing
2751913 it was a rough fight nobody in there wants to box me so i guess im going to have to slug it out bang out the body shots and then go back to boxing
2751914 that gave me a boost to keep on going even though i knew the score wasnt fair
2751915 the rest of sundays session was highlighted by two outstanding performances by unrelated british fighters named saunders
2751916 i think that was a mature performance from a man who isnt 19 yet and against a world bronze medalist
2751917 he showed tremendous maturity billy is a bit more mature than khan to be honest with you
2751918 we are totally against the china olympics that are taking place in china lots of people were killed since march 10th we are mourning here thats why we are wearing black clothes and black bands for all the tibetans who died in tibet
2751919 when i came in they said they werent sure and so i said ill take it
2751920 you just blast it on goal and see where it lands it worked
2751921 we were very close to being in the quarterfinals and now we are very far
2751922 klejstan equalized in the 64th minute running onto a through ball from freddy adu cutting inside and turning defender kew jaliens before blasting a right footed shot past goalkeeper kenneth vermeer
2751923 in the dying seconds well maybe not the dying seconds to get a goal for 2 2

2751934 police including senior crime officers pathologists and other specialists are now working to establish the circumstances surrounding the deaths and are conducting forensic examinations
2751935 i am very shocked i cannot see if we should live in this area any more
2751936 men dette er det som er talt ved profeten joel
2751937 revival is not about signs and wonders but to fall in love with
2751938 hvorfor bruker du mer tid p kritikk enn p s ke gud da
2751939 if you have both types of accounts you should hold the tips and all bonds and the reits in the tax advantaged accounts and then hold the most tax efficient equities in the taxable accounts that is the proper answer to the location problem also want to hold volatile equity asset classes in taxable accounts since that increases the value of the tax option loss harvesting foreign holdings in taxable allow you to take the ftc
2751940 there are critics though and i am one of them that think perhaps investors are not quite getting what they expect for a start the holdings in the index funds are market capitalisation weighted this sounds sensible of course except when you consider just how much the biggest companies dominate the portfolio the top one hundred stocks in america representing just 3 of the number of stocks in the index funds actually account for over 60 of the funds invested in vanguards fund
2751941 when you get down to the genuinely small capitalisation stocks there is actually very little money invested in each stock which is why it probably isnt surprising that over long periods of time the wilshire 5000 index performs pretty much the same as the big capitalisation growth stock dominated s amp p500 index
2751942 the art of creating a good portfolio is not about owning everything in market weighted proportions as the total market index does but in having significant exposure to every asset class and rebalancing the portfolio at an appropriate frequency
2751943 so if you want to take advantage of the rebalancing effect you are going to need to have a much larger small cap value exposure in your portfolio than just a couple of percent
2751944 while s amp p 500 index and total market funds make for effective pieces on an investment pie they should only be slices not the whole pie they just dont provide sufficient diversification as stand alone vehicles
2751945 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
2751946 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
2751947 no one wanted to see india out of the olympics but the reality is that the best 12 nations have qualified for beijing
2751948 the hockey world will obviously miss india but im confident they will comeback stronger and ready to take on the world again
2751949 want to use the platform of the olympics to amplify the effects
2751950 if the world were to draw any lessons from what i did there would never be any wars
2751951 hmmm thats a good question let me think about that for a second
2751952 im not really sure im going to have to think about that for a bit and get back to you
2751953 im not sure to be honest what do you think
2751954 ive never really considered that perhaps you can expand the question a little and we can explore it right now
2751955 im not sure how we would deal with a sudden spike in the cost of bandwidth we would have to collect more information and answer that question down the road

2751960 alison and adam are absolutely over the moon they couldnt be more happy
2751961 where are the twenty something millennial bloggers writing about social change activism and nonprofits
2751962 i arise each morning torn between a desire to save the world and a desire to savor it that makes it hard to plan the day
2751963 last year improvements we made to reedbed habitat was key to attracting these magnificent birds to our reserve
2751964 we all held our breath and hoped theyd be back this year and they havent disappointed
2751965 its great weve now got two juveniles hurtling about the place watching them is just breathtaking
2751966 the commissions exclusion of internet communications from the coordinated communications regulation severely undermines
2751967 if you advertise on the internet thats an expenditure of money much like if you were advertising on television or the newspaper
2751968 keep your hands off of this and well change the statute to make it clear
2751969 i want my own segway and i want a segvator
2751970 we have people whove taken very good care of their pets and now have lost a job
2751971 so now were doing more billing where we spread the payments out for things that cant be put off
2751972 especially if an animal is older or if the emergency care is about 1 000 then the owners are saying we cant do that
2751973 its not everybody but were seeing that a little bit more
2751974 were euthanizing way more horses than we used to do even a year ago what happens is it becomes easier to euthanize the old horse than do colic surgery
2751975 youre seeing less of the people who think they can make money breeding horses because the demand for horses has dropped off
2751976 i have more clients who are anxious to learn how to give their animals shots instead of paying me to do that
2751977 the owners are choosing to euthanize sooner because it costs so much to maintain them
2751978 i see a lot of people trying to find a good home for their horse some people are still taking care of them but they would like to cut back it is too many mouths to feed
2751979 gas and oil prices are affecting all of this i dont expect the prices to come down because of the economy
2751980 weve seen a notable increase in the number of horses for sale starting in april and may and i think well see more cattle up for auction this fall
2751981 in the last couple of months there have been about a half dozen people who have said im having trouble keeping this animal and i cant afford it
2751982 one of our volunteers predicted this situation two years ago economics for us is critical
2751983 we are getting more e mails and phone calls from people who want to find another home for their horse every single one of them has said their reason has been economics
2751984 its a nightmare right now and emotionally i brace for it because i have to tell them no i cant take your horse and i know theyre hurting economically
2751985 there are so many people desperate to get rid of their horses and they give it to someone who then doesnt take care of it
2751986 i know of seven cases like that in the last six months
2751987 i think the price of hay will affect the horse owners more
2751988 people can make the shoes last a few more weeks or trim them every three months instead of every two months but horses have to eat every day
2751989 we have healthy horses available for adoption and have not had any serious applicants in quite some time
2751990 we may have to face the possibility of having to euthanize the horses that we have and close our doors simply because we can no longer afford to feed them
2751991 were hearing those sanctuaries are getting more and more calls from people whore trying to place their horses
2751992 its because of the high hay prices or being squeezed because of the rising fuel prices or people needing homes for their animals because of foreclosures
2751993 one of the biggest factors in how hospitals are run in the us comes down to how quickly they pay their bills
2751994 the vast majority of hospitals in the united states could be saving a great deal of money if only they were inclined to pay their vendors on time we believe this is one of the most significant factors as to why healthcare costs are skyrocketing currently and why rates for hospital finance contracts and agreements are on the rise
2751995 the program actually pays for itself and in some cases can become a profit center
2751996 the vast majority of hospital and med center vendors offer fairly significant discounts that are rarely taken advantage of because of immediate cash concerns
2751997 we work with the hospital to define who the vendors are that will be offered the program offer them the program and then new payment terms are established
2751998 with the security capital program there is no cost to the hospital because the program is unsecured
2751999 of course we will do anything possible to analyse a totally unfamiliar track
2752000 we have a track map and we can estimate how fast it is and which aero settings it requires
2752001 this 192 10 1 10 is the only station that should be allowed to manage r6
2752002 attempts by other devices to manage r6 via snmp should be logged

2752019 you can control beijing as much as you like but youre not going to see much of an effect
2752020 on the day of opening ceremonies we had rain clouds in the southwest and northwest they were moving closer to the birds nest and there was a high probability of rain
2752021 the conditions were just right calm seas excellent visibility and not much traffic in the shipping lanes i just opened up the throttles and the crafts four rolls royce turbines did the rest

2752023 economy is extremely strong with many business sectors reporting huge profits
2752024 california is home to 36 5 million residents with a population growing over 800 000 last year however by 2025 our population will explode nearly doubling to 60 million people with our large diversified economy california will continue to prosper the demand for housing will remain strong and as this housing downturn comes to an end we will once again do very well
2752025 the media will still report about massive delinquencies and huge foreclosures in the sub prime market but those reports will not be accurate because they dont explain the difference between a delinquent payment a notice of default or a foreclosure
2752026 all you read and hear is that real estate is going down yet last month prices in the u s rose 3 4 from a year ago and california is up almost 1 the bay area prices have gained 4 1 over last year and southern california median price is up 3 7

2752052 the two candidates tax plans would have sharply different distributional effects mccains reduced individual and corporate rates could improve economic efficiency and increase domestic investment but the larger future deficits would reduce and might completely negate any positive effect in contrast senator obamas proposed new tax credits could encourage desirable behavior particularly if the childless eitc and payroll tax rebate encourage additional labor supply among childless low income individuals however he would also direct new subsidies at an already favored group seniors and an already favored activity homeownership which could probably be directed elsewhere

2752065 how can you defend frances laws banning hijabs in public schools
2752066 theyve banned sikh turbans and the wearing of christian crosses and the jewish star of david as well
2752067 the law is against exhibiting overt religious symbols in public france is a secular country and it has every right to do so what if a european woman appears in a mini skirt on zainab market you will say since you are an islamic republic you have the right to ban such attire in public wouldnt you i think they tolerate a lot more hijabs and turbans in their country than we can ever tolerate crosses shorts and skirts in ours

2752084 my biggest motivation for doing this film was that for the first time a sensible director had started making good sensible punjabi films who besides having a vast experience in film making was in love with punjab and his mother tongue he was not making a film out of any motive like to make quick profit but was making a film with an aim to take punjabi films to a new height

2752191 ich denke probleme wie zwangsprostitution muss man an der wurzel bek mpfen eine frau die in ihrer heimat die m glichkeit hat ihre familie zu ern hren sich zu entwickeln wird nicht auf die idee kommen einem dubiosen typen 5000 euro zu geben damit der sie nach deutschland oder westeuropa schleust wo sie ausgenutzt wird

2752196 hearing the news was tragic stunning words cant describe it
2752197 how can i help thats all we were thinking we talked about how the best thing we could do was try to play volleyball
2752198 it meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys when we heard from him
2752199 he talked about trying to move on he just told us it will be difficult but together well be much stronger
2752200 we wanted to have a moment of silence where we could gather our thoughts before starting this journey
2752201 it was a moment of silence to honor the bachman family
2752202 the one thing weve always talked about is that this is about a team its not about individual people
2752203 the thing that came across as hugh was talking to us is you know what ive got this happening right now but we came here with a goal in mind and weve invested all this time in it and we need to go out there and try to complete what we started
2752204 it means going out there and playing better every match than we did the previous match
2752205 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2752206 maybe thats why it hurt so much it just felt so close
2752207 the best way we can honor them at this juncture is to go out and compete every day and play hard every day and enjoy and love the game of volleyball and it is a game
2752208 we should be playing it and enjoying it and loving it as they would
2752209 were totally aware that we may see him and we may not

2752224 the northern territory election is a reminder to all of us in politics that the australian people will hold us accountable and this is an important lesson for all sides of politics particularly those of us who are currently in government
2752225 its failed to live up to those expectations and they will be punished
2752226 state and territory labor governments were getting away with gross mismanagement by blaming the howard government for their own failings

2752244 its not an algorithm anymore its a fixed number things have been zeroed out its the beginning of something but right now its still a void and we tend to think of the void as an abyss or a vacuum with nothing there in fact its a new road and what you should do on this new road is close for repairs close right away because that old vehicle is not going to work on that new road i mean if the cosmos is a loving healing thing that also spins real fast and erupts and does violent stuff and if there really is some kind of order to the whole thing then everything thats led up to this moment has to be part of it or the math doesnt work but in this transition phase i really am trying to live as much like a lizard as i can hot rock sun fly tongue
2752245 we just tried to get that last shot i was wide open it was actually a simple play

2752266 it is now clear that the prime minister was simultaneously involved in lobbying to secure a loan for the auberge grand m re and in negotiating the sale of shares in an adjacent golf course whose value could be affected by these same loans

2752304 from what i can tell their approval process is not very strict at all
2752305 its more technical than content related is what it seems like to us i think they run it start it up and if it doesnt crash they approve it they brainlessly click through and if theres problems they remove it is what it seems like
2752306 theyre shooting themselves in the foot these days theyre probably just understaffed

2752336 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2752337 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2752338 it subtracted 1 2 points from gdp and fell for a fifth consecutive quarter by 19 2 that follows decreases of 18 7 in the third quarter and 11 1 in the second quarter the fourth quarter decline was the highest since 1991
2752339 on the surface the figure looks solid increasing 4 4 the problem however is that it reflects a gain of just 3 6 in nominal spending because the personal consumption deflator fell 0 8 its first decrease since 1961 and the largest decline since 1954 according to market news

2752386 now for some more color on this years results in our larger markets i will start with the pool side of our business in florida clearly the market most affected with new pool construction down by 40 or more coupled with competitive pricing pressure and extended receivables this is the market where our competitors financial position is stretched the most our sales were down 12 in the quarter and year to date arizona with new pool construction almost as bad as florida we continue to hold our own as sales were down 7 in the quarter and down 3 year to date our strong teams in the state continue to significantly outperform the marketplace california the older and very large installed base of pools has helped mitigate the impact of less new pool construction with our sales down 6 in the quarter and up 2 year to date certain markets here are more affected by the interest rate revision and adjustable rate mortgages than in florida or arizona which are more affected by the housing supply bubble created by speculative construction
2752387 turning to the irrigation landscape portion of our business our base business sales in the west were down 10 in the quarter and down 2 year to date more tied to construction than the pool side the results are reflective of difficult market conditions
2752388 i would like to explore a little bit more the competitive environment and pricing environment do you think you have hit bottom or will this linger over the winter and into the spring of next year manny perez de la mesa in terms of margin deterioration on the sell side or selling margin side generally speaking the deterioration that we saw in the late spring of this year has been maintained this year we did not have the pickup that we had last year in the third quarter when if you will recall the three largest equipment manufacturers announced pricing increases effectively in may of last year but the actual margin deterioration really has been maintained not any worse or any better but maintained since late spring since may timeframe when some of our competitors were most stretched financially in terms of next year what we anticipate is that there will be ongoing pressure on a number of our competitors

2752405 there were no boundaries of genres music was meant to serve a higher purpose and address issues there were so many things i want to say it also gave me an opportunity to compose and write

2752433 thanks for making this a betting matter rc it gives the question a higher profile
2752434 gives the lie to the notion that there is universal scientific consensus on agw
2752435 even today the fact that a few scientists predicted a global cooling in the 1970s is still used to undermine the credibility of climate science
2752436 long before we run out of oil we will run out of atmosphere
2752437 i see the media in comfortable lockstep with agw proponents
2752438 its a good point though since most top reporters come from ivy league schools where no such requirement exists
2752439 gavin you responded at 11 that emissions are rising at 3 per year while concentrations only rise at 0 5 per year that is somewhat logical because there was already some concentration before we started any emissions
2752440 as i explain the nature study is consistent with the following statements
2752441 everyone recognises that the earth undergoes a warming response to enhanced greenhouse forcing
2752442 actually the media lag far behind the scientists in terms of the level of consensus

2752444 in general the object of prediction is to assist the layman and it is the opinion formed by him that decides whether they will suceed or fail
2752445 el nino unlocking the secrets of the master weather maker
2752446 how do we know that recent co2 increases are due to human activities
2752447 evidence shows that co2 is going up at over 3 per year
2752448 the testing took months but finally identified the problem the stresses caused by thousands of takeoffs and landings were causing the planes aluminum skin to crack eventually the metal would completely fail causing immediate depressurization of the cabin and catastrophic structure failure
2752449 as the airplane leveled at 24 000 feet both pilots heard a loud
2752450 the boeing 737 classic was designed with a fail safe structure
2752451 a failure of models to predict correctly does not necessarily mean the model is completely wrong
2752452 an overwhelming scientific consensus has determined humans are responsible for most of the global warming in the last xx years
2752453 i would also like a climate scientist to confirm that in and of itself co2 would block no more than 0 04 of out going infra red radiation a supplementary question would the absorbed energy raise the molecules temperature or increase its velocity or are these one and the same thing
2752454 we ought therefore to agree that pre human or more precisely pre industrial climate change was caused by changes in solar activity
2752455 we ought also to agree that fossil fuel burning industrialisation pumps increasing quantities of co2 plus water vapour and sensible heat i wonder whether the models include these directly into the atmosphere
2752456 the ipcc argues that these effects completely swamp solar ones on two main grounds first the rate of warming in the latter half of the 20th century exceeds all previous experience and second otherwise their models dont make sense well the latter sounds a bit chicken and egg ish to this layman
2752457 on the other side of the atlantic unpublicised revisions to the us temperature record reveal that six of the hottest ten years occurred in the first half of the 20th century
2752458 accordingly it is prudent not to expect continued year after year warming in the near future and in so doing diminish concern about global warming should global cooling instead manifest itself again
2752459 i would also like a climate scientist to confirm that in and of itself co2 would block no more than 0 04 of out going infra red radiation
2752460 a supplementary question would the absorbed energy raise the molecules temperature or increase its velocity or are these one and the same thing
2752461 there could be some cooling in europe and north america over the coming decade as the natural cooling offsets the warming from human activities
2752462 stable and reach the stratosphere unchanged over a five to seven year period following release into the atmosphere
2752463 2004 pointing to where it was at that time the last 200 years are in the tiny little bit of the chart right of the tickmark
2752464 i have difficulty with the notion that any matter making up a proportion
2752465 all waves would pass through an atmosphere comprising only n2 or o2 no waves would pass through an atmosphere comprising only co2 but you imply less than half the waves much less perhaps zero would pass through an atmosphere of half co2 and half n2 or o2 why is this so
2752466 on the other part of your answer to my query i take it that heat would be transferred from co2 molecules to n2 and o2 by conduction
2752467 i have difficulty with the notion that any matter making up a proportion x of a medium can intercept a proportion 250x of waves passing through
2752468 on the other part of your answer to my query i take it that heat would be transferred from co2 molecules to n2 and o2 by conduction and that this would raise the intensity of radiation from the atmosphere to the surface
2752469 downright embarrassing it still seems a little tough for the very heavy cfc molecules to get to the top of the troposphere and then through the narrow gate of the tropopause in a half dozen years but as you say its just a thought i have no studied reason to dispute it
2752470 as to radiation transfer within the atmosphere there are many ways energy can be transferred to the surface its not just radiation
2752471 i would also like a climate scientist to confirm that in and of itself co2 would block no more than 0 04 of out going infra red radiation
2752472 these measurements and arguments had fatal flaws herr koch had reported to ngstr m that the absorption had not been reduced by more than 0 4 when he lowered the pressure but a modern calculation shows that the absorption would have decreased about 1 like many a researcher the assistant was over confident about his degree of precision 8a but even if he had seen the1 shift ngstr m would have thought this an insignificant perturbation he failed to understand that the logic of the experiment was altogether false
2752473 the numerous oscillations between ice ages and inter glacial warming periods also express natural causes most likely related to solar impacts of one kind or another if not what else
2752474 making the case for agw dependant solely on the unprecedentd rate of current warming
2752475 trimmed of the three observation greater than an anomaly of 1 00 and the two less than 0 6 the remaining 20 span the 76 years from 1931 and show an even slighter warming trend
2752476 that there is a warming trend in an inter glacial period is unsurprising that it is so slight given the agw hypothesis and the rapid increase in co2 emissions over the period is surprising
2752477 whether a water reservoir was analagous to the atmoshere pumping water into a reservoir at a faster rate than it is draining out results in the reservoir overflowing
2752478 what happens to all those watts accumulating in the atmosphere as the surface pumps in energy at 1 6 times the rate at which it escapes to space
2752479 ray what you didnt tell me is that as well as the 59 trillion photon gobbling co2 molecules in the air column there are 98 quadrillion photon friendly molecules of n2 and o2
2752480 1 water vapor content of the atmosphere has not changed significantly co2 has increased by 38 and 2 water vapor peters out at the cloudtops while co2 is well mixed and continues to work as a ghg and absorb ir up into the stratosphere
2752481 a photon absorbed into vibration energy of co2 does not raise its temperature
2752482 what makes carbon dioxide so interesting is that the gas absorbs energy in some small segments of the thermal infrared spectrum that water vapor misses
2752483 there are lies and damned lies then there are statistics
2752484 yes jim thats me requesting more time for scientists to sort out their widening set of differences before economists are let loose on the project
2752485 can only be tested by the predictive reliability of computer models derived from the hypothesis
2752486 yes jim thats me requesting more time for scientists to sort out their widening set of differences before economists are let loose on the project
2752487 explanations exist they have existed for all times for there is always an easy solution to every problem neat plausible and wrong
2752488 the scientists found regions where the water was acidic enough to dissolve the shells and skeletons of clams
2752489 challenge to real climate on the ipcc global climate model predictions of global warming
2752490 each time starts again close to the observed climate because it is initialised with observed sea surface temperatures
2752491 since such radiation is the only way energy escapes the climate system that has to heat things up
2752492 i am a loner lacking competence to refute received wisdom as evidenced here over recent days but attracted to those who arent so constrained
2752493 117 ray what you didnt tell me is that as well as the 59 trillion photon gobbling co2 molecules in the air column there are 98 quadrillion photon friendly molecules of n2 and o2 the probability of the photon escaping to space is 0 9994 no
2752494 we definitely dont look at it like pressure on us

2752496 we werent afraid to feel the pain which is why im so dizzy right now
2752497 there were words said but we know theyre a force to be reckoned with and were going to have to go against them
2752498 mom i know you probably forgot so im going to remind you i dont like ice cubes in my tea because i hate when my tea gets watered down you put ice cubes in my tea and well i dont like that so next time just try and remember okay
2752499 im not going to indicate what may or may not have been discussed at cabinet but our position is quite straightforward we dont support the use of capital punishment
2752500 when an australian overseas has been convicted and is subject to capital punishment as a sentence we make representations on behalf of australian citizens when it comes to other individuals who arent australian citizens well make a judgment on a case by case basis as to whether its appropriate to make representations or to join in representations at a regional or multilateral level
2752501 but the prime minister and i have both made clear that we dont propose to make representations on behalf of terrorists who have been subject to the death penalty
2752502 so i wont be making any individual representations so far as the bali bombers are concerned
2752503 ill be just making the point in our formal bilateral conversation in jakarta tomorrow that we have three of the bali nine still subject to the death penalty
2752504 ill make inquiries about the progress of their cases through the indonesian legal and judicial system and again make the point that when those processes have been completed that if any of those three still remain the subject of the death penalty well be making a plea for clemency in accordance with our normal processes

2752517 bushs men were demanding extra spots for the secret service agents
2752518 the focus of this inquest is to get a recommendation from the jury that in custody deaths should not be investigated by the police force involved in the death
2752519 there appeared to be an inordinate number of deaths in custody over the course of which the police didnt seem to be held accountable
2752520 complied with all appropriate policies procedures guidelines and statutory requirements for the arrest and treatment of persons taken into and released from custody and whether such policies procedures and guidelines are adequate
2752521 under the situation as it now exists because its a federal body the province cant pass legislation to review complaints against the rcmp
2752522 the only thing that can be good essentially is the way in custody deaths are investigated
2752523 the high cost of fuel the higher cost of food could be affecting peoples disposable income people have less money to donate
2752524 a lot of our clientele are single parent families and seniors with fixed incomes
2752525 id imagine if the cost of food is going up the cost of transportation is going up that could definitely propel people into food bank reliance
2752526 fuel is a piece of food banks budgets in terms of trying to acquire and share the food and as transportation costs go up that is putting an additional squeeze on their resources that we havent seen in previous years
2752527 hunger is a significant issue in this country which is sad given the fact that we live in such a wealthy country
2752528 it really takes the effort of all of us the charitable community is there companies are there helping to support and we definitely need government support as well
2752529 hes never needed food but hes been laid off for some time
2752530 that was just two this week for me so if thats happening at our warehouse i imagine thats happening throughout the city
2752531 its not food prices that are making people fall over the brink
2752532 bp while i completely acknowledge the historical fact of white responsibility how long do we wait for white folks to change
2752533 what do we expect america white people in particular to do to take this responsibility
2752534 what is our vision for a new world where are we going what do we want to do
2752535 appealing to the moral conscience of white folks who have neither morals nor conscience according to malcolm seems like a futile exercise no matter how much truth we invest in the telling

2752562 we will do anything not to allow georgia and ukraine to join nato
2752563 you cannot discuss the violence of this region outside the context of oil
2752564 the georgians are euphoric because they have been equipped trained that they have gained military experience in iraq it feeds this revanchist mood how can south ossetia be demilitarized when all of georgia is bristling with weaponry and it s only an hour s ride by tank from tbilisi to tskhinvali

2752566 though there were areas of overlap we found that common motivations for self benefit included interaction with the birds a sense of achievement social interaction personal stimulation and enjoyment
2752567 past research shows that people take part in wildlife activities for many reasons and so require a sophisticated level of management our findings reinforce that
2752568 though self satisfaction motivations were mentioned most often people also had many unselfish reasons for taking part in conservation including helping this vulnerable species preserving nature for future generations and serving the community
2752569 with declining budgets most wildlife agencies are not well equipped to manage the growing number of species at risk so they are depending more on volunteers to help with wildlife management operations
2752570 what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity

2752576 bij het aanvangen van de legislatuur van de schepen van vlaamse aangelegenheden brigitte de pauw had ze gezegd dat ze binnen de honderd dagen een oplossing zou vinden voor de branding aan de goede wil ontbreekt het zeker niet want ze steunt ons maar toch zijn er nog geen concrete pistes

2752584 pi di un pilota su due viene dalla king school
2752585 we feel that a customer would want to buy products that cesar recommends since hes a specialist in his field
2752586 the original vision at the heart of shared worlds has always been the desire to provide a place where oddball kids like me could get together and play with ideas
2752587 every step is progress at least you found the heart of the problem
2752588 we condemn any who affirm that the jurisdiction of the roman pontiffs is not ordinary and immediate both over all the churches together and over individual churches of particular pastors
2752589 if anyone says that the primacy of the roman pontiff is only the office of inspection and direction and that his supreme power of jurisdiction over the universal church is not full but only extraordinary and mediate let him be anathema
2752590 if anyone says that the roman pontiff has only the office of inspection or direction but not the full and supreme power of jurisdiction over the whole church that this power is not ordinary and immediate either over each and every church or over each and every shepherd and faithful member let him be anathema
2752591 this power of the supreme pontiff is far from standing in the way of the power of ordinary and immediate episcopal jurisdiction by which the bishop who under appointment of the holy spirit succeeded in the place of the apostles feed and rule individually as true shepherds the particular flock assigned to them
2752592 bishops are not to be accounted as vicars of the roman pontiff
2752593 in matters of discipline there is no institution so legitimate no right so certain that the pontiff when the good of souls calls for such action cannot override it as when pius vii suppressed the french dioceses in the concordat
2752594 full power which he can exercise not only in extraordinary cases but always alike on all the faithful and on the bishops of the whole church
2752595 that by the words of christ feed my lambs feed my sheep the care and custody of the universal flock of the lord entrusted to peter and his successors the roman pontiffs and that by this the unity and firmness of the holy church of god is cemented no catholic denies every catholic venerates peter and the roman pontiff as the supreme pastor under whose supreme rule the other pastors successors of the apostles rule as bishops the particular churches in which they are set by the holy ghost to rule the church of god i object to the word episcopal because it is impossible for the pope to exercise episcopal jurisdiction in all dioceses
2752596 the formula immediate and ordinary jurisdiction is most true if rightly understood but liable to be misinterpreted if not made more clear
2752597 the supreme pontiff without doubt has supreme and full power over the whole church and over each and every part of it but it should be exercised saving the rights of the bishops the jurisdiction of bishops is immediate and ordinary received from god each in his own dioceses but is so subordinated to the roman pontiff that his supreme power of jurisdiction over every single part of the universal church is immediate and ordinary
2752598 that the pontiff has ordinary and immediate power over each and every church is true and not open to doubt in the sense that this power is his own and not delegated and certainly exercised of itself and not directly but it should not be brought into play usually so as not to interfere with the bishops immediate and ordinary jurisdiction the popes primacy of universal jurisdiction rests on the clear words of christ taken in their obvious and natural meaning such is the tradition of the gallican church from irenaeus to bossuet some limits should be set to the usual exercise of the primacy and a recognition of the jurisdiction of bishops metropolitans patriarchs the right of appeal to rome is certain but the jurisdiction of the lower courts should be respected
2752599 in a canonist and theological sense the roman pontiff may be said to have ordinary and immediate jurisdiction over every single diocese provided it is not taken to mean that he is the only real bishop of all the churches and the others only improperly called bishops
2752600 we teach and declare that the power of jurisdiction of the primacy which is proper to it is ordinary and immediate over all and maybe exercised directly without seeking anyones consent
2752601 if anyone says that the authority of the pope in the church is so full that he may dispose of everything by his mere whim let him be anathema
2752602 we are not in a theatre to hear buffooneries but in the church of god to transact the serious business of the church
2752603 in view of the orthodox churches no canons with anathema should be enacted on the matter of the primacy only the decree of florence without addition and a decree protecting the rights and privileges of the old patriarchates
2752604 i will not utter frivolities but i must defend the institutions of my church by vindicating what is just and licit
2752605 the rights of the patriarch are by ecclesiastical law those of the pope by divine law and what is of divine law cannot be limited by what is of ecclesiastical law we are making a dogmatic not a disciplinary decree and it would cause confusion to bring in what is only of ecclesiastical law note this was in reference to the request by some of the oriental representatives to include a statement on the prerogatives of patriarchs though this latter request was not granted per the argument given by freppel a whole new text as noted earlier was added to include the rights of bishops which are also of divine law in keeping with the purpose of the text the rights of the patriarchs however was addressed at vatican ii which formally completed vatican i ordinary and immediate are no new terms for the popes universal jurisdiction the former was used by the fourth lateran council the latter by st thomas when popes have said that they may not act counter to the canons does that imply they are bound by the canons every legislator in every kind of government is bound to observe the laws he has made or confirmed unless and until they be lawfully abrogated this by natural and divine law because the common good and right order of any society require it this distinction excludes the fantastic despotism or absolutism that we have heard spoken of absolutism is the principle of ulpian in the roman law that the mere will of the prince is law but who has ever said that the roman pontiff should govern according to his sweet will by his not by arbitrary power by fancy that is without the laws and canons we all exclude mere arbitrary power but we all assert full and perfect power is power arbitrary because it is supreme are general councils confirmed by the pope arbitrary because supreme let all this confusion of ideas go let the doctrine of the schema be accepted in its true proper and genuine sense without preposterous interpretations
2752606 the jurisdiction itself is not questioned by anyone but there is a certain jealousy that the terms used in asserting it might seem to derogate from the position of bishops as successors of the apostles the terms when rightly understood were sound and did not give rise to any curtailment of the ordinary immediate jurisdiction of each bishop in his diocese will any bishops say that the pope would have to get his permission to preach or hear confessions or administer the sacraments in his diocese when this question has been put it has been met with laughter the most conclusive answer in regard to this chapter being a bar to the reunion of the eastern churches when the time comes god will move their hearts and minds meantime let us pray for them and let us define the truth fearlessly
2752607 in what sense is the infallibility of the pope to be called
2752608 i say this with sorrow that it has been alleged in this ambo that all the infallibility of the church were seated in the pope and from the pope derived and communicated to the church but i cannot understand how the true reason is that this infallibility was given by christ to the entire magisterium of the church that is to the apostles along with peter
2752609 it is true that the pope in his definitions ex cathedra has the same founts fonts as the church has scripture and tradition it is true that the agreement of the present preaching of the whole magisterium of the church united with its head is the rule of faith even for definitions by the pope but from this can by no means be deduced a strict and absolute necessity for inquiring about it from the bishops for such agreement can very often be deduced from the clear testimonies of holy scripture from the agreement of antiquity that is of the holy fathers from the opinions of doctors or in other private ways which suffice for full information that strict necessity such as would be necessary for inclusion in a dogmatic decree cannot be established there may be a case so difficult that the pope deems it necessary for his information to inquire from the bishops as the ordinary means what is the mind of the churches such was the case regarding the immaculate conception but such a case cannot be set up as a rule
2752610 it has been widely but most erroneously asserted by the adversaries of our faith and possibly even some catholics may have imbibed the notion that this definition makes the pope infallible in all his words and actions and even to the extent of whatsoever he thinks nay some have been so absurd as to say that it makes him sinless but this is not the doctrine of the definition nor is it the teaching of the church the definition does not extend infallibility to the private teaching of the pope still less to his conversation or to his ordinary actions or to his political functions or to his judgment of causes as between man and man to nothing of this kind does it reach they are excluded by the very terms the past is guarantee for the future and prescribes the general principles and rules by which the popes are guided scripture and tradition are the fountains of their judgments into these they inquire consulting his brother bishops according to the gravity of the case in some cases the catholic tradition is so obvious that they require but little if any consultations to determine the mind of the church hence it is also stated in the decree that it is not new doctrine or any new revelation but the deposit of faith delivered to the apostles which not by inspiration but by the guiding assistance of the holy ghost they are able to keep inviolable and to expound without error christ constituted his vicar as the representative of his authority to peter thus constituted he promised by his prayer an unfailing faith and with that unfailing faith he enjoined him to confirm his brethren but if the consent of the church were needed for the validity of his definitions it would not be the vicar of christ who confirmed his brethren but his brethren who confirmed him
2752611 behind the scenes as no one else in closest touch with all that went on so that of all the bishops he was by his position the best accredited interpreter of the acts of the council
2752612 all public official acts of popes bulls of depositions of monarchs of assigning sovereignty over territories acts of legislation impositions of penalties and much else
2752613 he submitted a copy of his pamphlet to pius ix who had it examined by a board of theologians and caused it to be translated into italian that he might read it himself
2752614 it in no way depends upon the caprice of the pope or upon his good pleaser to make such and such a doctrine the object of a dogmatic definition he is tied up and limited to the divine revelation and to the truths which that revelation contains he is tied up and limited by the creeds already in existence and by the preceding definitions of the church he is tied up and limited by the divine law and by the constitution of the church comment this previous line has great relevance to our discussion about the popes relationship to his brother bishops lastly he is tied up and limited by that doctrine divinely revealed which affirms that alongside religious societies there is a civil society that alongside the ecclesiastical hierarchy there is the power of the temporal magistrates invested in their own domain with a full sovereignty and to whom we owe in conscience obedience and respect in all things morally permitted and which belong to the domain of civil society
2752615 nothing could be more opportune or more worthy of praise or cause the truth to stand out more clearly than this pastoral
2752616 two histories of the council of friedrich and of granderath of great length running each to over two thousand pages letters of bp
2752617 week by week to england telling them news of the council and of rome
2752618 we have tested for everything we have looked at anything that could have possibly had an influence but all the tests have been inconclusive
2752619 every week we seem to find more when we fly over the area
2752620 though we learnt a lot during the operation we have not found the exact cause of the pansteatitis inflammation of fatty tissue that has caused the deaths of so many crocodiles in this river system
2752621 a new theory being investigated is that healthy crocodiles are preying on the carcasses and getting infected from eating diseased fat and tissue
2752622 in order to break this cycle we have taken the decision to remove the carcasses from the water and burn them
2752623 though we didnt manage to capture our goal of 30 crocodiles the operation has given us an idea of the rate of infection at the confluence of the olifants and letaba rivers
2752624 seven of the 11 captured crocodiles were found to be infected
2752625 it was tough for them trying to produce a good time on their own they beat four crews and now it depends on the repechage where they will need another four seconds
2752626 i was so excited last night that i only got to bed at 1am and had to get up at 6am
2752627 its a little bit hard to get going in the morning i dont think they had the swimmers at heart when they put the finals in the morning
2752628 i was one of the weak links but with this improvement i think gold is possible but silver is in our hands
2752629 i felt tired when i woke up perhaps it was the nerves
2752630 my stroke felt better yesterday my body just caved in over the final 10 metres but i came in seeded 18th and set a pb so im happy with that

2752639 never before has there been such a compelling account of demonic possession and deliverance in a protestant evangelical context
2752640 if youre elected what are you going to do for me
2752641 every man in this house knows it is not a debt we cannot without the grossest corruption appropriate this money as the payment of a debt we have not the semblance of authority to appropriate it as charity mr speaker i have said we have the right to give as much money of our own as we please i am the poorest man on this floor i cannot vote for this bill but i will give one weeks pay to the object and if every member of congress will do the same it will amount to more than the bill asks
2752642 several years ago i was one evening standing on the steps of the capitol with some members of congress when our attention was attracted by a great light over in georgetown
2752643 the next summer when it began to be time to think about election i concluded i would take a scout around among the boys of my district
2752644 i began well friend i am one of those unfortunate beings called candidates and
2752645 yes i know you you are colonel crockett i have seen you once before and voted for you the last time you were elected i suppose you are out electioneering now but you had better not waste your time or mine i shall not vote for you again
2752646 this was a sockdolger i begged him tell me what was the matter
2752647 well colonel it is hardly worthwhile to waste time or words upon it
2752648 i intend by it only to say that your understanding of the constitution is very different from mine and i will say to you what but for my rudeness i should not have said that i believe you to be honest
2752649 i admit the truth of all you say but there must be some mistake
2752650 it is not the amount colonel that i complain of it is the principle
2752651 individual members may give as much of their own money as they please but they have no right to touch a dollar of the public money for that purpose
2752652 the congressmen chose to keep their own money which if reports be true some of them spend not very creditably and the people about washington no doubt applauded you for relieving them from necessity of giving what was not yours to give
2752653 so you see colonel you have violated the constitution in what i consider a vital point
2752654 i tell you i felt streaked i saw if i should have opposition and this man should go to talking and in that district i was a gone fawn skin i could not answer him and the fact is i was so fully convinced that he was right i did not want to but i must satisfy him and i said to him
2752655 well my friend you hit the nail upon the head when you said i had not sense enough to understand the constitution
2752656 he laughingly replied yes colonel you have sworn to that once before but i will trust you again upon one condition
2752657 if i dont said i i wish i may be shot and to convince you that i am in earnest in what i say i will come back this way in a week or ten days and if you will get up a gathering of people i will make a speech to them get up a barbecue and i will pay for it
2752658 no colonel we are not rich people in this section but we have plenty of provisions to contribute for a barbecue and some to spare for those who have none
2752659 well i will be here but one thing more before i say good bye i must know your name
2752660 well mr bunce i never saw you before though you say you have seen me but i know you very well i am glad i have met you and very proud that i may hope to have you for my friend
2752661 it was one of the luckiest hits of my life that i met him
2752662 at the appointed time i was at his house having told our conversation to every crowd i had met and to every man i stayed all night with and i found that it gave the people an interest and confidence in me stronger than i had ever seen manifested before
2752663 though i was considerably fatigued when i reached his house and under ordinary circumstances should have gone early to bed i kept him up until midnight talking about the principles and affairs of government and got more real true knowledge of them than i had got all my life before
2752664 i have known and seen much of him since for i respect him no that is not the word i reverence and love him more than any living man and i go to see him two or three times every year and i will tell you sir if every one who professes to be a christian lived and acted and enjoyed it as he does the religion of christ would take the world by storm
2752665 but to return to my story the next morning we went to the barbecue and to my surprise found about a thousand men there i met a good many whom i had not known before and they and my friend introduced me around until i had got pretty well acquainted at least they all knew me
2752666 in due time notice was given that i would speak to them they gathered up around a stand that had been erected i opened my speech by saying
2752667 fellow citizens i present myself before you today feeling like a new man my eyes have lately been opened to truths which ignorance or prejudice or both had heretofore hidden from my view i feel that i can today offer you the ability to render you more valuable service than i have ever been able to render before i am here today more for the purpose of acknowledging my error than to seek your votes that i should make this acknowledgment is due to myself as well as to you whether you will vote for me is a matter for your consideration only
2752668 i went on to tell them about the fire and my vote for the appropriation and then told them why i was satisfied it was wrong i closed by saying
2752669 and now fellow citizens it remains only for me to tell you that the most of the speech you have listened to with so much interest was simply a repetition of the arguments by which your neighbor mr bunce convinced me of my error
2752670 it is the best speech i ever made in my life but he is entitled to the credit for it and now i hope he is satisfied with his convert and that he will get up here and tell you so
2752671 fellow citizens it affords me great pleasure to comply with the request of colonel crockett i have always considered him a thoroughly honest man and i am satisfied that he will faithfully perform all that he has promised you today
2752672 he went down and there went up from that crowd such a shout for davy crockett as his name never called forth before
2752673 i am not much given to tears but i was taken with a choking then and felt some big drops rolling down my cheeks
2752674 there is one thing which i will call your attention
2752675 i have long been an advocate of ending the income tax and eliminating the irs
2752676 between 1787 and 1913 we had no permanent income tax system and america prospered the sixteenth amendment was ratified to prevent the supreme court from ruling the income tax unconstitutional as it had done in 1895
2752677 the income tax isnt necessary to pay for government services
2752678 only about 42 percent of government revenue is collected through the personal income tax
2752679 if we further reduced spending to the 1992 level we could quickly pay off our foreign debt return our nation to solvency and make april 15th a normal day
2752680 would you be comfortable with the government providing the services they did just fifteen years ago if it meant never paying income taxes again
2752681 no squad of men can live anywhere we have been the people have neither seed corn nor bread or mills to grind the corn if they had it as i burned them wherever found i have taken from these people the mules with which they would raise a crop the coming year and burned every surplus grain of corn
2752682 the government of the united states has any and all rights which they choose to enforce in war to take their lives their homes their lands their everything to the persistent secessionist why death is mercy and the quicker he or she is disposed of the better
2752683 do you agree that the confederate flag should be flying over the south carolina statehouse
2752684 let us also go that we may die with him
2752685 lord we do not know where you are going how can we know the way
2752686 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
2752687 lets all go down to the river theres a man walking on the water
2752688 im sure the next church will make it up to you

2752711 mahmoud darwish knew how to express the attachment of an entire people to its land and the absolute desire for peace his message which calls for coexistence will continue to resonate and will eventually be heard
2752712 the palestinian question in mahmoud darwishs poetry was no longer a legend but the story of people made of flesh blood and feelings
2752713 the voice of palestinian civilisation with its pains sadness and ambitions
2752714 he turned the palestinian cause into songs that transcended the cause and all other arab issues

2752742 sacraments are holy signs and seals of the covenant of grace immediately instituted by god to represent christ and his benefits and to confirm our interest in him as also to put a visible difference between those that belong unto the church and the rest of the world and solemnly to engage them to the service of god in christ according to his word
2752743 indeed on a year ended basis cpi inflation might rise further before it starts to come down particularly given the recent further surge in global oil prices beyond what we assumed in our may projections he said during a speech in sydney
2752744 you shouldnt be waiting until its really obvious that inflation has gone all the way back down to where wed like it to be before you can conclude you ve got to start doing something before that day mr stevens said
2752745 just as you shouldnt be tightening before the day that inflation really gets going
2752746 i dont want to comment on some particular outcome or indicate a decision
2752747 the effects of that will be working against the expansionary forces from the terms of trade and the broader pressures on inflation from high resource utilisation he said
2752748 inevitably there is a lot of uncertainty about how these opposing forces will net out
2752749 but the forecast we released in our may 2008 statement on monetary policy was that the net result would be a significant slowing in demand and output growth this year
2752750 most people abroad have no idea of what really is going on at my countrys border and what the roots of the conflict are this is the 3rd attempt by georgia to wipe out ossetians as a nation and seize their land after the ethnic cleansing of 1992 when georgians burned ossetian villages russian troops and georgian forces were stationed in s ossetia as peacekeepers with a un mandate friday night hours after georgian president said he was not planning any military action georgia began bombing s ossetia first they used jets and missiles then they invaded tskhilvali using tanks the footage you could see on cnn and other western tv stations who said it were russians were bombing georgia was actually the footage of georgia bombing tskhinvali before communications were cut off here in moscow we got many calls from there people shouting they were being massacred by georgian troops last but not least u2013 the majority of residents of s ossetia are citizens of the russian federation

2752755 si la parte rusa quiere seguir presionando con el ataque militar no hay mucho que puedan hacer los georgianos est n siendo atacados duramente por lo que tenemos que confiar en la diplomacia
2752756 no estamos hablando de algo m s all de la diplomacia por el momento
2752757 se ha especulado sobre si el motivo por el que rusia ha utilizado este desproporcionado uso de la fuerza contra georgia es precisamente porque no quiere verla avanzar hacia la otan

2752770 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2752771 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2752772 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2752773 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2752774 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

2752777 i like the 1995 bvtv logo it is so cool bout it is so cool can you send me that sond file if you send to me i like touchstone 1985 but i was not there at that time
2752778 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2752779 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2752780 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2752781 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2752782 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2752783 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2752784 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2752785 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2752786 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2752787 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2752788 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2752789 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2752790 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2752791 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2752792 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2752793 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2752794 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2752795 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2752796 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2752797 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2752798 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2752799 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2752800 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2752801 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2752802 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2752803 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2752804 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2752805 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2752806 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2752807 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2752808 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2752809 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2752810 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2752811 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2752812 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2752813 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2752814 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2752815 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2752816 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2752817 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2752818 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2752819 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2752820 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2752821 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2752822 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2752823 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2752824 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2752825 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2752826 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2752827 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2752828 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2752829 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2752830 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2752831 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2752832 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2752833 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2752834 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2752835 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2752836 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2752837 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2752838 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2752839 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2752840 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2752841 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2752842 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2752843 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2752844 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2752845 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2752846 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2752847 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2752848 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2752849 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2752850 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2752851 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2752852 who are open to doing something on the production side
2752853 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2752854 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2752855 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

2752865 to see what he went through it makes it easier for what we do in games like capture the flag and scatterball

2752903 in sydney high oil and mortgage vulnerability is distributed across much of the citys western suburbs including hebersham green valley cabramatta and canterbury in the mid and outer west
2752904 the number of areas in which oil and mortgage vulnerability increased over the 2001 to 2006 period far outweighed those in which oil and mortgage vulnerability declined
2752905 41 per cent saw their oil and mortgage vulnerability worsen between 2001 2006
2752906 the full impacts of the dramatically higher 2008 fuel prices will probably not be seen until the early years of the next decade in this context the problem of household socio economic vulnerability and exposure to the impacts of higher fuel prices and mortgage interest rates remains highly relevant
2752907 the problems of suburban infrastructure deficits especially in public transport reflect the consistent failure of state governments to expand infrastructure to keep pace with the rate and scale of land development
2752908 these problems have been exacerbated by the planning of suburban areas around automobile travel
2752909 i havent been this excited about a new record since the 80s
2752910 im a loner in my private life so the party animal only comes out on stage thats really my connection to people
2752911 i liken them to favorite children you never get tired of trotting out your kids when they do well at something youre really proud of it
2752912 there are a lot of people who were fans when they were little kids theyve grown up and are bringing their kids and women are bringing their husbands
2752913 im not one of those people who says whats the point of marriage
2752914 find someone you can be yourself around who makes you laugh who challenges you in a good way and where you just speak off each other
2752915 my parents have been married more than 25 years with all the glory and all the pain you can imagine but theyve stayed together
2752916 it makes life easier besides the possibility has never really arisen
2752917 because id hope that people wouldnt say no to me because im an actor but theyd have to be a pretty extraordinary

2752924 he went off and voted with minority leader harry reid on the democratic substitute and i wrote him the now famous letter
2752925 i would like to apologize to you for assuming that your private assurances to me regarding your desire to cooperate in our efforts to negotiate bipartisan lobbying reform legislation were sincere
2752926 im embarrassed to admit that after all these years in politics i failed to interpret your previous assurances as typical rhetorical gloss routinely used in politics to make self interested partisan posturing appear more noble
2752927 that was one incident where he thought i had undercut him i had a completely different view of it
2752928 we had to take tough votes sometimes against the majority of our own party in order to preserve the coalition

2752932 in my work my speaking and my life i deliver excellence and help people i am valuable and what i say is valuable the time i take to speak with care and power is an investment for myself and for others people benefit from my ideas i benefit from theirs
2752933 if you cant communicate well youll never participate fully in society overall your career and relationships will be below your potential
2752934 the greatest loss in the world is the loss of human potential
2752935 on the take off she initiated twisting a little early
2752936 it wasnt a fall or anything but it gave us a tiny disturbance at the last minute we had to reorganize things and readdress
2752937 its something we werent expecting it threw us for a loop its more stressful knowing we only had four gymnasts and that it is four up and four scores count but we put it into our minds that we couldnt let anything get to us
2752938 i missed out on the floor exercise finals which is sad
2752939 but you get hyped up and throw a little too much power into it and before you know it youre out of bounds
2752940 there wasnt anything wrong i fell it was a mistake
2752941 whereas in 1777 congress facing a national shortage of bibles for our schools and families and for the public worship of god in our churches announced that they desired to have a bible printed under their care amp by their encouragement and therefore ordered 20 000 copies of the bible to be imported into the different ports of the states of the union
2752942 whereupon the congress was moved to order the committee of commerce to import twenty thousand copies of the bible

2752948 coriolanus is a celebrity who the people insist on becoming a role model politician
2752949 we havent taken this play and said look how great our republicans are or look how great our democrats are

2752955 these are friends of mine that happen to be very different in leadership style philosophy and background
2752956 i would like america to get to know them the way i do and make a decision based not on campaign ads that tend to caricature the other guy im going to ask questions that are very different from a lot of the debate and town hall forums
2752957 it could be a real breakthrough in our political discourse
2752958 most americans want a president who cares about the welfare of the citizens and of the nation
2752959 you dont always get an answer to that by reading stories that focus on is obama a muslim
2752960 cares about the welfare of the citizens and of the nation

2752971 it is uncommon for a healthy middle aged man to die from pneumonia
2752972 usually there is an underlying factor damage to the immune system of some sort
2752973 if sarcoidosis is mild it is highly unlikely that it could have fatal complications for somebody with pneumonia
2752974 if his sarcoidosis was severe it could be the case
2752975 immunosuppressive drugs for treatment of pulmonary conditions such as sarcoidosis could be a contributing factor to macs death

2752977 i think the blue skies will come especially after todays rain
2752978 today is raining and tomorrow will have rain too that will help reduce the air pollution level we believe the current air flow will be helpful in the dispersion of pollutants in the air
2752979 you can control beijing as much as you like but youre not going to see much of an effect
2752980 on the day of opening ceremonies we had rain clouds in the southwest and northwest they were moving closer to the birds nest and there was a high probability of rain

2752994 since then the life expectancy of those treated in community mental health centers has plunged to an appalling 25 years less than average
2752995 life expectancy may have fallen by as much as 15 years since 1986 indications are that the death rate continues to accelerate in what must be ranked as one of the worst public health disasters in u s history
2752996 advances in brain imaging techniques show that antipsychotic medications cause brain damage
2752997 animal and human studies link the drugs to shrinkage of the cerebral cortex home to the higher functions
2752998 there is no point in speaking about referees they like the attention
2752999 i think other people need to comment on it because people are watching how managers react
2753000 when you hear of referees summits with managers pictures up on screens talking about individual managers you shake your head and wonder what is going on in the game
2753001 but i refuse to comment and give the limelight to the referee
2753002 i will talk about st mirren players i thought the st mirren players were outstanding from the first minute to the last
2753003 if they play that way for the rest of the season we will be delighted
2753004 we asked them to be brave and play the ball and maybe with a bit of luck we could have taken something from the game
2753005 we will be hard pressed to find another advocate who is equally skilled at garnering bipartisan support for vulnerable populations as well as the elderly

2753008 most people rarely talk about their bowels but the fact is that its a widespread problem
2753009 they gave routine medical care a try and it didnt work
2753010 i couldnt stop thinking my body was exhausted and my mind was still going
2753011 as a nation our mental health capability is not adequate to the need
2753012 because of inadequate resources adults and children in need of mental health services often must wait weeks or months for services when they turn to non profit mental health care providers for help our organizations have experienced double digit increases in insurance fuel and energy
2753013 adults and children who cannot access service on a timely basis can deteriorate and end up in crisis needing much more expensive treatment and services
2753014 we would not think of making a heart patient wait until he experiences a massive heart attack before providing treatment we must end this discrimination against those with a mental illness
2753015 when i tell people i have a book coming out about a boy with bulimia they are very very surprised
2753016 most people including myself were not aware that men and boys could suffer from eating disorders
2753017 it was a challenge for me to present this story from the point of view of my main character 17 year old parker rabinowitz because its told in first person in his voice
2753018 and like all of the other characters in the book parker does not know nor understand whats happening to him why hes binging why hes purging what it means what it is what the consequences will ultimately bring
2753019 it was also important to me to present bulimia in all its complexity
2753020 my research showed eating disorders arent about food but about control i needed to create a sadly familiar world of modern teenage pressures in which competitiveness stress the need for approval from others and the pursuit of unattainable perfection can wreak total tragic havoc on a body and soul in ways that last a lifetime
2753021 his entire thesis undermines the credibility of the doctors under whose supervision he states patients should adjust their medication
2753022 the effect is to encourage them instead to make decisions to stop their medications on their own or on the advice of well meaning but misinformed nonmedical experts such as himself
2753023 the life expectancy of those treated in mental health centers has plunged to an appalling 25 years less than average since the introduction of atypical antipsychotics
2753024 clearly this remarkable claim is based on extrapolation from highly questionable assumptions
2753025 these risks have to be balanced against the devastating consequences of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder the illnesses for which they are most clearly indicated
2753026 one of these risks is a substantially increased chance of suicide in untreated mania bipolar depression or schizophrenia treatment of these conditions has been shown to reduce suicidality and therefore would be expected to increase life expectancy
2753027 i have seen abusive fans who act abusively in front of their own children and that seems reprehensible to me
2753028 abusing kids or young adults at a sporting event in front of children cannot send the correct message
2753029 i think our identity becomes wrapped up at an early age
2753030 it says a lot about our families we adopt a lot of things
2753031 but fan behavior at youth sport events is a whole different deal and we are all familiar with the out of control parent
2753032 if it affects their relationships and their focus becomes so narrow then its probably problematic then maybe they need to develop coping strategies
2753033 for me 1986 the last time the mets won the world series will last a long time
2753034 i had a nephew this year who was 11 years old and he was extremely upset
2753035 that kind of put me in a different role and i had to put it in perspective
2753036 so whats wrong with me thats the question that i really secretly know the answer to my problem is love my problem is hearbreak not always the romantic kind but the frienship kind as well my problem is defined by no other words but love and disappointment in others but also in myself in this very life i live
2753037 out of the silence inc is now officially a registered u s non profit organization we fall under the category of 501 c 3 an irs code that designates the non profit tax exempt status
2753038 prior to this out of the silence was recognized as a state new jersey non profit but now the national government also acknowledges us as a public charity
2753039 is it the war its unquestionable that the high op tempo the multiple deployments and long deployments put a real strain on relationships
2753040 theres also normal girlfriend boyfriend breaking up irrespective of the war marital difficulties that arise in both civilians and soldiers were not seeing a clear relationship between conflict increase and suicide
2753041 one of the things that i believe is happening looking at these reports is that the army is very very busy and perhaps we havent taken care of each other as much as wed like to
2753042 as a nation our mental health capability is not adequate to the need
2753043 britney has made clear to everyone that she does not want to be further harassed or contacted in any way by osama sam lutfi now or at anytime in the future
2753044 mr lutfi and mr spears have mutually agreed in private that no hearing or order is necessary at this time
2753045 during the temporary conservatorship the conservators have the power to insure that lutfi will not harm britney anymore
2753046 if mr lutfi makes any future attempt to contact britney after the temporary conservatorship has concluded britney has made clear she will take all appropriate legal action

2753060 one of the key challenges for the radio industry is how to ensure that radio is included in every device i am delighted that the first ever dab fm plug in for ipods will be launched later this year bringing radio to our audiences where they want and when they want it
2753061 we recognise the importance of putting radio into new devices and of keeping the medium relevant for a new generation of listeners adding radio to mobile phones and mp3 players means the size of the radio receiver market can double overnight leading to more opportunities to listen to radio than ever before so it is important for radios digital future that we are available to consumers via market leading devices like the ipod bereits vor einiger zeit an was hnlichem rumgedacht man darf gespannt sein wie das ansteckteil ankommt und wann und ob es auch auf dem kontinent verbreitung finden wird technik

2753071 survey work confirms our earlier estimate that over 1 000 000 iraqi citizens have died as a result of the conflict which started in 2003 we now estimate that the death toll between march 2003 and august 2007 is likely to have been of the order of 1 033 000 if one takes into account the margin of error associated with survey data of this nature then the estimated range is between 946 000 and 1 120 000

2753084 across the casentino there runs a stream called archiano born in the apennines above the hermitage there at the place where that streams name is lost i came my throat was pierced fleeing on foot and bloodying the plain and there it was that i lost sight and speech and there as i had finished uttering the name of mary i fell and there my flesh alone remained you are aware how in the air moist vapor will gather and again revert to rain as soon as it has climbed where cold enfolds his evil will which only seeks out evil conjoined with intellect and with the power his nature grants he stirred up wind and vapor and then when day was done he filled the valley from pratomagno far as the great ridge with mist the sky above was saturated the dense air was converted into water rain fell and then the gullies had to carry whatever water earth could not receive and when that rain was gathered into torrents it rushed so swiftly toward the royal river that nothing could contain its turbulence the angry archiano at its mouth had found my frozen body and it thrust it in the arno and set loose the cross that on my chest my arms in pain had formed it rolled me on the banks and river bed then covered girded me with its debris

2753105 i know matthew but you know what one time when i was your age something like this happened to me too
2753106 well i was in church and some really cool guys were sitting behind me i decided to talk to them
2753107 i started to talk to them and they told me to shut up
2753108 i started crying then my mother your grandma walked me out of the church
2753109 no she knew that i felt bad because the boys yelled at me she explained to me that at church you are not supposed to talk and the boys knew that and didnt want to get in trouble

2753115 this just wasnt a good race for the 16 car
2753116 our car had more oversteer than we would have liked and we didnt have the pace today
2753117 but our sister car had a strong run and there are some lessons to take from this one we need to study the data closely sometimes we take different directions with setups on the cars and in those cases sometimes it just doesnt work for one of us but we are a team and we make these decisions together the aim is always to learn more for the long term
2753118 the guys ran hard all weekend and did a great job

2753126 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2753127 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2753128 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2753129 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2753130 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2753131 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2753134 dude its 10 45 pm you have been watching the olympics since noon
2753135 what do you mean its on for two more weeks
2753136 oceans represent 70 of the earths surface but currently provide only 6 of human protein every year
2753137 theres a very academic discussion happening in europe right now still asking is the climate already changing and is climate change noticeable today here in burkina faso that debate is not happening because the effects already speak for themselves
2753138 widespread drought poor rainy seasons heavy loss of livestock limited food supply and soaring prices of food fuel and fertilizer linked to the global food crisis are contributing to the troubled outlook for children in ethiopia
2753139 twenty five people have died and over 200 displaced following yesterdays flooding in jijiga town somali state southeastern ethiopia according to the residents
2753140 climate change in burkina faso does not mean there is less rain it means that rainfall has got less predictable and weather overall has become much more extreme in the way it comes the heat the cold and the peaks and troughs of rainfall
2753141 people cannot predict when rain will come and then when it does it falls in buckets last year in burkina faso there were eight rainfalls over 150mm that means eight major floods in one four month period
2753142 the alternative to floods is basically no rainfall its all or nothing and either way is a crisis for some of the poorest people on earth in ways that are just completely unpredictable
2753143 t he average citizen in burkina faso is emitting 0 38 tonnes of co2 every year while the chinese emit 10 times more the british 30 times more and the americans 75 times more per capita
2753144 it just proves this enormous moral issue that those who contributed nothing to climate change are bearing the brunt of the changes it is causing whereas we who caused it all have gotten away with it the north is getting away with murder basically
2753145 visions of a dystopian future where americans are forced to cook their breakfast over candles or where thousands of jobs have been lost because of what one opponent called economic disarmament by the us
2753146 already taken the planet into a condition where human experience no longer provides a reliable indication of the future
2753147 that night i went into labour in a small bamboo thatched house on the banks of the pyapon river to deliver my first child but as the wind roared my husband and i struggled outside only to see our home destroyed right before our very eyes
2753148 as the rain poured down and the water began to reach my chest my husband lifted me on to some floating debris as i lay there the labour pains became so painful i began to scream i needed help
2753149 finally among the broken pieces of wood i gave birth around six in the morning but almost died in the process i had lost so much blood both my husband and the woman who had helped me deliver thought i was gone but a single hope kept me hanging on that my son needed me
2753150 after the cyclone i thought the worst was over but finally i understood that the worst of our hardship bringing our lives back to where they were had only just begun
2753151 on the face of it it looks like some sort of mass suicide but the question is why the dolphins had swallowed and inhaled big chunks of mud from the estuary their lungs and stomachs were full of it that is very bizarre indeed
2753152 dolphins may be becoming stranded as a direct consequence of mercury contamination which damages their neurological system they become potentially confused and disorientated and strand themselves
2753153 this is a truly alarming result in effect three quarters of eastern australias millions of resident and migratory shorebirds have disappeared in just one generation
2753154 the wetlands and resting places that they rely on for food and recuperation are shrinking virtually all the way along their migration path from australia through indonesia the philippines malaysia and up through asia into china and russia
2753155 these data indicate that iapv is a highly pathogenic virus
2753156 but they do not yet support a finding of iapv as the sole cause of colony collapse disorder we still suspect that additional stresses are needed to trigger ccd
2753157 with the sheer number of compounds were finding in hives its hard to believe that pesticides arent contributing to the general decline in bee health
2753158 turning off lights for 60 minutes isnt going to stop the antarctic ice sheets melting stop thousands of pacific islanders losing their homes from rising sea levels or stop the earths temperature rising one jot

2753160 the class lights up when you enter you have given us a bright future
2753161 im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2753162 weve made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2753163 we deplore the dangerous and disproportionate actions by russian forces and we would be particularly troubled if these attacks are continuing now as the georgians are pulling back
2753164 very very concerned if in fact there is ground action inside of georgia proper that is outside of these areas of abkhazia and ossetia
2753165 its not the power of the curse its the power you give the curse
2753166 i would also use graphic organizers and sequencing chards to help the students make predictions and sequence story events collecting these work samples is another way i could assess the students

2753172 excellent reading teachers also understand that large group direct instruction is time consuming and costly and that often many children in the class will not benefit from this instruction
2753173 the role and qualifications of the reading coach in the us
2753174 what am i supposed to do all day three big ideas for the reading coach
2753175 how can i help to make this program more successful
2753176 excellent teachers understand how reading and writing development are related and they effectivelyintegrate instruction to take advantage of the childs development in both areas they are familiar with the sequence of childrens reading development they believe that all children can learn to read and write
2753177 have supplemental materials and rich classroom libraries that contain at least seven books per child
2753178 including a wide variety of fiction and nonfiction genres such as storybooks novels biographies magazines and poetry
2753179 effective schools and accomplished teachers lessons about primary grade reading instruction in low income schools
2753180 time spent in small group instruction for reading distinguished the most effective schools from other schools in the study and was offered by teachers in these schools as a reason for their success
2753181 early intervention is key in helping at risk young students avoid potential problems in learning to read
2753182 they know when to organize children in large groups for direct explicit instruction when small group or individual instruction in more appropriate and when children will learn more efficiently on their own
2753183 an excellent reading teacher knows a wide variety in instructional philosophies methods and strategies
2753184 parents community members and teachers must work in partnership to assure that children value reading and have many opportunities to read outside of school
2753185 research based reading instruction allows children opportunities to both understand the building blocks and expand their use of language oral and written childrens comprehension of written language depends in large part upon their effective use and understanding of oral language
2753186 the teachers in most effective schools spent 134 minutes a day on reading
2753187 they use the information from standardized group measures as one source of information about childrens reading progress recognizing that standardized group achievement tests can be valid and reliable indicators of group performance but can provide misleading information about individual performance
2753188 from their observations and the childs own self evaluations they draw knowledge of the childs reading development and they can relate that develpoment to relvant standards
2753189 there is recognition of the need for personnel with specialized knowledge about reading instruction who can provide essential services not only to students but to teachers whose diverse students present many challenges
2753190 that teachers work together can reach the goal of high student achievement when they share a common vision
2753191 i know that having every parent get involved is too idealistic as there are many more things going on sometimes but it is important for schools and teachers to at least try to inform parents and have them assist in the promotion of good readers
2753192 teaching all children to read the roles of the reading specialist
2753193 there is recognition of the need for personnel with specialized knowledge about reading instruction who can provide essential services not only to students but to teachers whose diverse students present many challenges

2753221 mortgages issued in the first half of 2007 are going bad at a pace that far outstrips the 2006 vintage suggesting that the blow to the financial system from u s housing woes will be deeper than many people earlier estimated an analysis prepared for the wall street journal by the federal deposit insurance corp shows that 0 91 of prime mortgages from 2007 were seriously delinquent after 12 months meaning they were in foreclosure or at least 90 days past due the equivalent figure after 12 months was just 0 33 for 2006 prime mortgages evidence that lax lending standards were leading to higher mortgage delinquencies first emerged in late 2006 the first major casualty of the subprime credit crisis new century financial corp imploded in early 2007 yet the data from the fdic and others suggest that lenders didnt substantially tighten standards until at least july or august 2007 when credit jitters hit wall street and financial stocks began to swoon economists and industry officials say several factors may account for the dismal performance of the class of 2007 home prices were falling sharply in much of the country by 2007 meaning many borrowers in that year who took out loans for nearly the full price of the home now owe more than the homes are worth that makes it difficult for them to sell their home or refinance if they lose their job or experience another setback

2753335 hes a highly devoted young man and very dedicated to human rights issues
2753336 he took a great risk by coming here today but it was very dear to him to come here and highlight the human rights abuses being committed against the tibetan people
2753337 yes theres things that other governments would do different in terms of how they would deal with dissidents and protests but one hopes the olympics will give china the incentive to evolve their own approach in a way that will be very positive in the future
2753338 we want to send a clear message that the truth has to be exposed the reality behind the hosting of the olympic games and the stories that are not being told
2753339 its important to us to showcase the fact there is no freedom in tibet and they are dying as a result of the chinese occupation

2753365 muzik merupakan salah satu medium yang terbaik bagi menyampaikan mesej kepada umum namun paling utama adalah penerimaan majoriti terhadap lagu tersebut
2753366 sebagai contoh sesebuah lagu yang digemari dan diminati ramai pasti akan memberi impak kepada pendengar seterusnya membuatkan ia dinyanyikan oleh sesiapa sahaja dan dimana sahaja kata wah ketika ditemui di pejabatnya baru baru ini
2753367 langkah ini untuk mengembangkan sektor pengeluaran kerepak ubi dan pisang kerana ia mendapat pasaran yang baik dan boleh menambah pendapatan peniaga terutama yang tinggal di luar bandar
2753368 ahli koperasi juga digalakkan menanam ubi dan pisang sendiri yang boleh digunakan untuk pemprosesan kerepek kerana dengan cara itu kosnya lebih murah
2753369 kita juga menggalakkan ahli koperasi yang tidak mempunyai tanah memohon sekurang kurangnya empat hektar tanah tol daripada pejabat tanah daerah masing masing untuk tanaman pisang dan ubi
2753370 kita akan meminta kerjasama institut penyelidikan dan kemajuan pertanian malaysia mardi dan lembaga pemasaran pertanian persekutuan fama untuk ahli koperasi menjalani kursus pemprosesan pembungkusan dan pemasaran agar pengeluaran makanan ini lebih berkualiti serta berdaya saing
2753371 jika dahulu pertanian dianggap sebagai sara diri maha memberi gambaran bahawa pertanian bukan lagi untuk tujuan itu sebaliknya satu perniagaan

2753374 whenever people are expecting to get their jobs and they feel no justice from previous experience in sudan and eastern sudan that means people can take again their weapons and can fight again
2753375 the 25 million itself cannot solve any kind of problem
2753376 although we have stopped fighting with weapons still we are fighting by words and by committees and meetings to ensure that the peace agreement will be implemented
2753377 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2753378 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2753379 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2753380 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2753381 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2753382 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2753383 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2753384 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2753385 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2753386 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2753387 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2753388 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2753389 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2753390 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2753391 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

2753399 shes got a beautiful smile shes a great athlete you can see the millions going on there
2753400 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2753401 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2753402 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2753403 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2753404 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2753405 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2753406 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2753407 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2753408 the northern territory election is a reminder to all of us in politics that the australian people will hold us accountable and this is an important lesson for all sides of politics particularly those of us who are currently in government
2753409 its failed to live up to those expectations and they will be punished
2753410 state and territory labor governments were getting away with gross mismanagement by blaming the howard government for their own failings
2753411 the conservatives in the northern territory are coming off a very low base so in many respects the only way was up
2753412 russian troops are heading south and the next place in that direction is the town of gori our troops are positioned to defend the town
2753413 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on unprecedented scale in these conditions our forces conducted redeployment
2753414 i believe that the position of the international community supported by australia is that georgia is an independent state its territorial sovereignty should be respected and therefore all states should exercise restraint and that includes the russian federation
2753415 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2753416 they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered this situation can be resolved peacefully
2753417 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2753418 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2753419 i get chest pain it doesnt go away right away i suffer for a couple of days
2753420 a number of studies have been conducted where electromagnetic hypersensitivity individuals were exposed to electromagnetic fields similar to those that they attributed to the cause of their symptoms the aim was to elicit symptoms under controlled laboratory conditions
2753421 the majority of studies indicate that ehs individuals cannot detect emf exposure any more accurately than non ehs individuals well controlled and conducted double blind studies have shown that symptoms were not correlated with emf exposure
2753422 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2753423 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2753424 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2753425 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2753426 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2753427 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2753428 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2753429 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2753430 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2753431 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2753432 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2753433 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2753434 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2753435 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2753436 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2753437 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2753438 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2753439 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2753440 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2753441 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2753442 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2753443 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2753444 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2753445 i dont think its in telstras interests to be seen to be the company which is still trying to implement workchoices
2753446 in a democracy if people want to be a member of a union then the unions got a right to represent them and companies should recognise that
2753447 around half of australias top companies have employee collective agreements
2753448 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2753449 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2753450 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2753451 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2753452 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2753453 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2753454 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2753455 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2753456 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2753457 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2753458 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2753459 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2753460 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2753461 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2753462 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2753463 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2753464 i arise each morning torn between a desire to save the world and a desire to savor it that makes it hard to plan the day
2753465 he doesnt even spell his name with capital letters youve got to get the basics right in a game like this and to be frank sloppy mistakes like that can cost you big time you can only put that down to inexperience

2753532 when elijah reached horeb the mountain of god he went into the cave and spent the night in it then he was told go out and stand on the mountain before the lord then the lord himself went by there came a mighty wind so strong it tore the mountains and shattered the rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind after the wind came an earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake after the earthquake came a fire but the lord was not in th e fire and after the fire there came the sound of a gentle breeze and when elijah heart this he covered his face with his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave
2753533 after having fed the crowds jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side while he would send the crowds away
2753534 lord he said if it is you bid me to come to you across the water
2753535 are you he is to come or should we look for another
2753536 go and tell john what you have seen and heard the blind see the lame walk the deaf hear the dead are raised the poor have the gospel preached to them and blessed is he who takes no offense at me
2753537 especially through his lifestyle and through his actions jesus revealed that love is present in the world in which we live an effective love a love that addresses itself to man and embraces everything that makes up his humanity christ then reveals god who is father who is love as rich in mercy this truth is not just the subject of a teaching it is a reality made present to us by christ making the father present as love and mercy is in christs own consciousness the fundamental touchstone of his mission as the messiah
2753538 inefficacy of christianity after two thousand years of christian history we can see nothing that might be a new reality in the world rather we find it sunk in the same old horrors the same despair and the same hopes as ever and in our own lives too we inevitably experience time and again how christian reality is powerless against all the other forces that influence us
2753539 christian theology turned the kingdom of god into a kingdom of heaven that is beyond this mortal life the well being of men became a salvation of souls which again comes to pass beyond this life after death
2753540 you must realize now more clearly than ever that god is calling you to serve him in and from the ordinary secular and civil activities of human life he waits for us everyday in the laboratory in the operating theater in the army barracks in the university chair in the factory in the workshop in the fields in the home and in all the immense panorama of work understand t his well there is something holy something divine hidden in the most ordinary situation and it is up to each one of you to discover it

2753543 i got a little lucky my pawn sack probably wasnt sound but he tried too hard to hold on and i got a big initiative then he blundered an exchange and resigned right away i hadnt played him before but have a lot of respect for him as ive seen him win a lot of tournaments
2753544 then i would play c5 and could regain the pawn but would have to give up the bishop pair
2753545 there have been enough opportunities for the islamic council to enter the homosexuality debate now its time that the state stand up for some values and remove all financial support from the organization till they distance themselves
2753546 hot air says edwards is ready to take a paternity test given this language im not so sure
2753547 so why are mccains actions any more excusable than edwards because it was thirty years ago does that wash it away will we be fine with edwards running for office again in a couple of years because then it will all be in the past what is the statute of limitations on an affair remember ronald reagan nancy reagan and ross perot were so upset with how john mccain dealt with his first wife that they didnt forgive him for a very very long time perot still hasnt forgiven him in fact he said recently about mccain dumping his first wife for cindy mccain is the classic opportunist hes always reaching for attention and glory so i want every pundit who condemns john edwards today to tell me what the difference between him and mccain is and why john mccain shouldnt also be run out of politics for his adulterous affairs and what he did to his first wife

2753558 allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods for theirs in return is the garden of paradise they fight in his cause and slay and are slain a promise binding on him in truth through the law the gospel and the quran and who is more faithful to his covenant than allah then rejoice in the bargain which ye have concluded that is the achievement supreme
2753559 verily this and what jesus brought come from one lantern
2753560 honor power and glory belong to allah to his messenger and to the believers but the hypocrites know not
2753561 or do those in whose hearts is a disease of hypocrisy think that all h will not bring to light all their hidden ill wills had we willed we could have shown them to you and you should have known them by their marks but surely you will know them by the tone of their speech and all h knows all your deeds and surely we shall try you till we test those who strive hard for the cause of all h and as sabir n the patient and we shall test your facts i e the one who is a liar and the one who is truthful
2753562 do they then seek the judgment of the days of ignorance and who is better in judgment than all h for a people who have firm faith
2753563 those who take disbelievers for auliy protectors or helpers or friends instead of believers do they seek honor power and glory with them verily then to all h belongs all honor power and glory
2753564 o you who believe take not for auliy protectors or helpers or friends disbelievers instead of believers do you wish to offer all h a manifest proof against yourselves
2753565 we fear lest some misfortune of a disaster may befall us
2753566 and he allah said that he whom took them as ally hanif supporter and waley master besides allah his messenger and the believers then he is from them disbelievers in uniting against allah his messenger and the believers freedom from all obligations is declared from all h and his messenger peace be upon him to them
2753567 you show friendship to them in secret while i am all aware of what you conceal and what you reveal and whosoever of you muslims does that then indeed he has gone far astray from the straight path

2753574 but i really really have to go and i just cant find a public restroom
2753575 that was really decent of you is that what you call english hospitality
2753576 why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brothers eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye
2753577 we want to tell the world that those who conduct their foreign policy by using the language of threat against iran have to know that our finger is always on the trigger and we have hundreds and even thousands of missiles ready to be fired against predetermined targets
2753578 we will chase the enemies on the ground and in the sky and we are able react strongly to enemys threats in shortest possible time
2753579 we are making all out efforts to expand peace and security in the world you should not be concerned about a new war
2753580 but the iranian nuclear program and the iranian ballistic missile program must be of concern for the entire international community
2753581 honestly i didnt do anything i dont even like chocolate
2753582 oh god hasten the arrival of imam al mahdi and grant him good health and victory and make us his followers and those to attest to his rightfulness
2753583 i ask almighty god to assist all of us to move hand in hand to establish peace and future filled with friendship and justice and brotherhood
2753584 hon you are just so unselfish i really like that about you
2753585 it doesnt work that way true love is truly unconditional encompassing all flaws and all imperfections
2753586 love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength
2753587 quite the opposite in fact he is so confident and secure in who he is and who he is to me that those things just dont matter in the big picture
2753588 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life
2753589 rabbi we know you are a teacher who has come from god for no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if god were not with him
2753590 i tell you the truth no one can see the kingdom of god unless he is born again
2753591 how can a man be born when he is old
2753592 surely he cannot enter a second time into his mothers womb to be born
2753593 i tell you the truth no one can enter the kingdom of god unless he is born of water and the spirit flesh gives birth to flesh but the spirit gives birth to spirit you should not be surprised at my saying you must be born again the wind blows wherever it pleases you hear its sound but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going so it is with everyone born of the spirit
2753594 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through him whoever believes in him is not condemned but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of gods one and only son this is the verdict light has come into the world but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil everyone who does evil hates the light and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed but whoever lives by the truth comes into the light so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through god
2753595 the one who comes from above is above all the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks as one from the earth the one who comes from heaven is above all he testifies to what he has seen and heard but no one accepts his testimony the man who has accepted it has certified that god is truthful for the one whom god has sent speaks the words of god for god gives the spirit without limit the father loves the son and has placed everything in his hands whoever believes in the son has eternal life but whoever rejects the son will not see life for gods wrath remains on him
2753596 for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through him whoever believes in him is not condemned but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of gods one and only son
2753597 whoever believes in the son has eternal life but whoever rejects the son will not see life for gods wrath remains on him
2753598 the one who comes from heaven is above all he testifies to what he has seen and heard but no one accepts his testimony the man who has accepted it has certified that god is truthful
2753599 i am not sure what to make of it but i suspect that blogger saw or heard about all the negative internet chatter and negative press specifically mentioning this blog and responded
2753600 without any notice apology or explanation my posting privileges ha ve been reinstated bloggers guilty until proven innocent approach is appalling as bloggers it is a good thing we still have choices and i have exercised my choice to leave blogger and establish a new home at wordpress
2753601 at first i thought it was just this random thing with bloggers spam bots
2753602 i thought that perhaps in their looking across the blogger universe that i got accidentally flagged somehow stuff like that happens
2753603 be careful or your hearts will be weighed down with dissipation drunkenness and the anxieties of life and that day will close on you unexpectedly like a trap for it will come upon all those who live on the face of the whole earth be always on the watch and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen and that you may be able to stand before the son of man
2753604 well if christ is really coming back why didnt he just tell us when
2753605 okay well be back exactly at 6 00pm sunday night
2753606 hey were going to come home when you least expect it so you had better be on your best behavior
2753607 how i cannot take it anymore i am about to blow people are so rude and inconsiderate no one is polite all they care about is themselves no one has any manners i never wouldve parked in someones spot or cut someone off in gridlocked traffic or blocked someone in at a restaurant parking lot what is with people i cant take it anymore and im not even going to try
2753608 hey lord you might think this dude is faithful and strong but i bet if we took away all that he had hed be cursing you im sure that some hard times would cause him to lose his faith
2753609 well done good and faithful servant you have been faithful with a few things i will put you in charge of many things come and share your masters happiness
2753610 christians are stupid and weird nothing is going to happen
2753611 where is this coming he promised ever since our fathers died everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation
2753612 yeah right i guarantee christ is not coming back for you
2753613 most of all i am here to show the world that salvation exists in one form and one form only believing in christ
2753614 therefore keep watch because you do not know on what day your lord will come
2753615 nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be great earthquakes famines and pestilences in various places and fearful events and great signs from heaven luke 21 10 12
2753616 therefore keep watch because you do not know on what day your lord will come but understand this if the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into so you also must be ready because the son of man will come at an hour when you do not expect him
2753617 and i will give power to my two witnesses and they will prophesy for 1 260 days clothed in sackcloth
2753618 whats the absolute worst disaster that could possibly happen to the world that has never happened and probably couldnt or wouldnt happen a second time
2753619 obama or mccain which candidate will really work for peace
2753620 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life
2753621 oh i have to accept him for what he is
2753622 oh well most of the country loves him i guess i just have to accept him for who he is and go with the flow
2753623 love and accept everyone for who they are and tolerate all behaviors and beliefs
2753624 love everyone and accept the fact that they might do wrong things help them to see that and work with them to make things right pray for them that god might protect them and help them to understand
2753625 oh i believe in god in whatever form he might be god will love and forgive everyone we are his children i dont have to believe in christ to go to heaven
2753626 oh so and so is a nice person ill accept what theyre saying and just love them for their beliefs and for who they are buddhism is okay because they grew up with that
2753627 then they will call to me but i will not answer they will look for me but will not find me since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the lord since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes for the waywardness of the simple will kill them and the complacency of fools will destroy them but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease without fear of harm
2753628 love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and love your neighbor as yourself
2753629 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life
2753630 then jesus told him because you have seen me you have believed blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples which are not recorded in this book but these are written that you may believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that by believing you may have life in his name
2753631 jesus said to her i am the resurrection and the life
2753632 jesus answered i am the way and the truth and the life
2753633 and there is salvation in no one else for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved
2753634 and the witness is this that god has given us eternal life and this life is in his son he who has the son has the life he who does not have the son of god does not have the life
2753635 for by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not as a result of works that no one should boast
2753636 by the works of the law no one will be justified in his sight
2753637 but now a righteousness from god apart from law has been made known this righteousness from god comes through faith in jesus christ to all who believe there is no difference for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god and are justified as a gift by his grace through the redemption that came by christ jesus
2753638 for the wages of sin is death but the free gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord
2753639 he came to that which was his own but his own did not receive him yet to all who received him to those who believed in his name he gave the right to become children of god
2753640 repent and let each of you be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit
2753641 i can see that he claimed to be god but how do we know that the bible record of his claims are accurate
2753642 i am god and there is no other i am god and there is none like me i make known the end from the beginning from ancient times what is still to come i say my purpose will stand and i will do all that i please
2753643 again it will be like a man going on a journey who called his servants and entrusted his property to them
2753644 after a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them the man who had received the five talents brought the other five master he said you entrusted me with five talents see i have gained five more
2753645 his master replied well done good and faithful servant you have been faithful with a few things i will put you in charge of many things come and share your masters happiness
2753646 the man with the two talents also came master he said you entrusted me with two talents see i have gained two more
2753647 his master replied well done good and faithful servant you have been faithful with a few things i will put you in charge of many things come and share your masters happiness
2753648 then the man who had received the one talent came master he said i knew that you are a hard man harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed so i was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground see here is what belongs to you
2753649 his master replied you wicked lazy servant so you knew that i harvest where i have not sown and gather where i have not scattered seed well then you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers so that when i returned i would have received it back with interest
2753650 take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents
2753651 be wise dont be lazy and use all that you have for gods glory to serve him and help others
2753652 hey that couple worked hard for that money it wasnt handed to them they were disciplined and now they are enjoying life
2753653 no servant can serve two masters either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other you cannot serve both god and money
2753654 you are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of men but god knows your hearts what is highly valued among men is detestable in gods sight
2753655 watch out be on your guard against all kinds of greed a mans life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions
2753656 the ground of a certain rich man produced a good crop he thought to himself what shall i do i have no place to store my crops
2753657 you have plenty of good things laid up for many years take life easy eat drink and be merry
2753658 but god said to him you fool this very night your life will be demanded from you then who will get what you have prepared for yourself
2753659 this is how it will be with anyone who stores up things for himself but is not rich toward god
2753660 well done good and faithful servant come share your masters happiness

2753678 if anyone worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on the forehead or on the hand he too will drink of the wine of gods fury which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath he will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the lamb and the smoke of their torment rises for ever and ever there is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and his image or for anyone who receives the mark of his name
2753679 no way would i take the mark of the beast
2753680 write blessed are the dead who die in the lord from now on
2753681 see damascus in syria will no longer be a city but will become a heap of ruins the cities of aroer jordan will be deserted and left to flocks which will lie down with no one to make them afraid the fortified city will disappear from ephraim and royal power from damascus the remnant of aram will be like the glory of the israelites

2753683 it will be for a time times and half a time when the power of the holy people has been finally broken all these things will be completed
2753684 my lord what will the outcome of all this be
2753685 go your way daniel because the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end many will be purified made spotless and refined but the wicked will continue to be wicked none of the wicked will understand but those who are wise will understand
2753686 what in the heck why do i care about this
2753687 i dont get any of this its mumbo jumbo nothing makes sense
2753688 lord what has happened who are these people im ashamed and embarrassed that these humans live on this earth forgive them and find a way to reach them it is so sick and wrong i cant wait for the day where this earth is filled only with believers
2753689 dont you condemn me to hell who do you think you are
2753690 no way can you condemn millions of buddhists and muslims and such to hell just because they arent of your faith
2753691 its not fair that you get to sit back and enjoy life while we work our butts off its not right that you condemn us to work hard for the rest of our lives while you enjoy retirement were not bad people why do we have to suffer what gives you the right
2753692 yes i am the gate those who come in through me will be saved they will come and go freely and will find good pastures
2753693 so then if thats the case whats the scoring system how do you know if youve done enough to get into heaven is a good deed done by a wealthy well off happy man equal to the same good deed done by a poor sickly homeless person how do you as a human here on earth know when youre doing it right or scoring well
2753694 blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven whose sins are covered blessed is the man whose sin the lord will never count against him
2753695 i feel badly for them they want to get to know god but she cant take communion at his church and he doesnt necessarily want to go to her church
2753696 oh i couldnt do that im catholic i wouldnt feel right about doing it outside of the catholic church
2753697 wait i was a jerk i realized now that i need that
2753698 hey im sorry i didnt believe that the bible was even true i thought it was just a bunch of men making up stories
2753699 i gave you many signs i sent many people your way to help you see still you hardened your heart and denied it all you made the decision to reject my gift you didnt want it i will honor your decision
2753700 this is my son whom i love with him i am well pleased
2753701 rabbi we know that you are a teacher come from god for no one can do these signs that you do unless god is with him
2753702 most assuredly i say to you unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
2753703 how can a man be born when he is old can he enter a second time into his mothers womb and be born
2753704 most assuredly i say to you unless one is born of water and the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit do not marvel that i said to you you must be born again the wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes so is everyone who is born of the spirit
2753705 i tell you the truth no one can see the kingdom of god unless he is born again
2753706 how can a man be born when he is old
2753707 surely he cannot enter a second time into his mothers womb to be born
2753708 i tell you the truth no one can enter the kingdom of god unless he is born of water and the spirit
2753709 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit
2753710 yeah i believe in christ im saved im going to heaven
2753711 enter through the narrow gate for wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction and many enter through it but small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it
2753712 make every effort to enter through the narrow door because many i tell you will try to enter and will not be able to
2753713 i dont get it why do they even bother coming to church
2753714 hon they probably think they have to they probably walk out of here learning and gaining nothing yet in their minds they are saved because they go to church now and then
2753715 i dont want to be a born again im lutheran and i go to church thats enough for god and thats enough for me
2753716 cuanto m s vac a la carreta mayor es el ruido que hace
2753717 nadie est m s vac o que aquel que esta lleno del yo mismo
2753718 seamos lluvia serena y mansa que llega profundamente a las ra ces en silencio nutriendo
2753719 and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places all these are the beginning of birth pains
2753720 uh yeah earthquakes tornadoes fires floods etc have been happening for hundreds and hundreds of years there were some really bad ones in the past this is no different
2753721 this was the dream and now we will interpret it to the king
2753722 he gave me this explanation the fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth it will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth trampling it down and crushing it the ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom after them another king will arise different from the earlier ones he will subdue three kings he will speak against the most high god and oppress his saints and try to change the set times and the laws the saints christ believers during the great tribulation will be handed over to him for a time times and half a time
2753723 no way how can that be there are hundreds of countries no way could it ever be just ten governments for the whole world
2753724 at that time michael the great prince who protects your people will arise
2753725 we are sure lucky to have been conceived and to have this wonderful world
2753726 yes blessed be our mother who gave us life and each other
2753727 how great is the love of our mother that she shares all she has with us
2753728 were it up to me i would live here forever
2753729 and i believe that there is life after birth dont you
2753730 do we not shed our life cord and also the blood tissue when we are born and have you ever talked to anyone that has been born has anyone ever re entered the womb after birth to describe what birth is like no
2753731 who else gave us nourishment who else created this world for us
2753732 we get our nourishment from this cord and our world has always been here
2753733 and if there is a mother where is she have you ever seen her does she ever talk to you no we invented the mother when we were young because it satisfied a need in us it made us feel secure and happy
2753734 tenemos que trabajar duro con nuestros hijos hay que educarlos sobre los valores de la honestidad sobre los valores del trabajo de la dignidad pero sobre todo de los m s altos valores humanos y de la integridad
2753735 tenemos que luchar de manera implacable y decidida contra lo parece imponerse en estos momentos la cultura de la riqueza y el f cil sin trabajar sin hacer ning n tipo de sacrificio la cultura del consumismo desbordado la cultura de la ostentaci n
2753736 yo quiero advertir que nosotros no podremos tener una sociedad segura decente organizada si no enfrentamos pulgadas a pulgadas el tr fico y consumo de drogas cuyas acciones no tienen l mites ni escr pulos
2753737 tenemos un compromiso un gran compromiso con el pa s con las generaciones presentes y futuras como el compromiso de combatir el contrabando donde quiera que se meta donde quiera que se produzca un compromiso con la patria que no podemos eludir ni dejar para ma ana

2753749 the total cost for illegal immigrants to county taxpayers far exceeds 1 billion a year not including the millions of dollars for education
2753750 with 220 million for public safety 400 million for healthcare and 432 million in welfare allocations illegal immigration continues to have a devastating impact on los angeles county taxpayers
2753751 this is probably the most people weve ever seen use emergency food assistance
2753752 were seeing people who were making 70 000 a year coming into a food bank for the first time theyve used their retirement to pay their mortgage and gone through their savings
2753753 were seeing an increase in people who never would have asked for help in the past

2753760 life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about
2753761 my husband knew when we heard the second explosion and saw the ball of fire it was the propane place
2753762 for the last six months my daughter has actually been saying to me mom weve got to move this is a dangerous place
2753763 and she said mom one day this place is going to blow
2753764 and our nightmare came true this morning thats exactly what happened
2753765 my son came out freaking out so he must have seen something
2753766 well do a full investigation to determine if they made an error said travis tygart chief of the anti doping group
2753767 it has not escaped me that we have made less progress than the teams around us
2753768 i think the safety issue is one thats being stressed but its just an engineering problem and an engineering challenge
2753769 we have to go through it and be rigorous but its just like numerous other challenges on the car
2753770 we will all be trying to overheat or overcharge batteries
2753771 those who will use flywheels will all be trying to crash flywheels
2753772 it is still possible but clearly very tight to get something from the system at the start of the season
2753773 but in my opinion mclaren is clearly the strongest team
2753774 we are happy to have jason join our team he is a smart proven player that will compliment our offence
2753775 its exciting to come back home and play in toronto the team is poised to be solid this year and i hope to be an integral part of that and possibly win a championship
2753776 hosting the nll entry draft and combine along with blazers day is a great opportunity for our franchise as we prepare for the upcoming season
2753777 the event will be the perfect showcase to introduce the blazers and our tenacious brand of indoor lacrosse to the growing number of lacrosse fans in new england

2753848 es wurde pl tzlich immer rutschiger und ich bin leider gest rzt ber das vorderrad dann wurde zum gl ck f r mich abgebrochen und ich konnte beim zweiten rennen noch mal mitfahren anfangs war ich schon drei sekunden hinter joey und bin nur schwer ins rennen gekommen aber dann hatte ich ein immer besseres gef hl und kam wieder heran konnte joey sogar noch mal berholen zuletzt habe ich noch einen fehler gemacht und bin dann als dritter ins ziel gekommen joeys rger kann ich verstehen ich habe bei der zieldurchfahrt selbst nicht gewusst dass ich gewonnen habe
2753849 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2753850 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2753851 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2753852 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2753853 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2753854 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2753855 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2753856 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2753857 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2753858 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2753859 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2753860 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2753861 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2753862 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2753863 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2753864 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2753865 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2753866 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2753867 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2753868 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2753869 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2753870 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2753871 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2753872 that bloke from oasis said i couldnt play guitar somebody shoulda told him im a f g rock star

2753875 i am so excited that the academy has asked me to design a dress for this years emmy awards
2753876 i will be doing a red carpet look that still reflects the simple classic design of the lauren conrad collection but with a black tie twist
2753877 that my friends is a heck of a lot of fun
2753878 it seems to me that the vice president is more willing to get down in the wheelhouse below the decks
2753879 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
2753880 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
2753881 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed

2754061 one in a series devoted to u s marines in the korean war era is published for the education and training of marines as part of the dod observance of the 50th anniversary of that war
2754062 would go into the collective memory of the korean war as task force faith although it would never officially bear that name
2754063 colonel faith assumed command and organized all remaining personnel into a task force
2754064 fighter planes made a strike on high ground around task force faith
2754065 task force faith had been under attack for eighty hours in subzero weather
2754066 most of the men who had served with task force faith were left where the truck column stopped near the lumber village of hudong ni or were strewn along the road from there to the northernmost position
2754067 a helicopter sent in from hagaru ri by general hodes took out the two wounded battalion commanders reilly and embree
2754068 you were one of eight or twelve wounded who were removed by marine helicopters and thats all the wounded that ever got out except the few walking wounded
2754069 youre on your own theres nothing more we can do for you

2754072 sung shilun was amazingly well informed as to exactly what his opponents were doing chinese reconnaissance was good and korean civilians including line crossers were at least as useful to the chinese as they were to the americans moreover he apparently had a serviceable quantity of signal intelligence from radio intercepts stymied by the marines stubborn defense at yudam ni and hagaru ri he decided to finish off the us army forces east of the reservoir by adding the weight of the 81st division to the 80th division already engaged against task force faith
2754073 three days earlier peng realized the number of enemy troops he was facing at the chosin reservoir was double the original estimate he decided to concentrate the forces of the ninth army on the weakest link of the reservoir defense task force maclean now peng owned everything east of the reservoir and could concentrate on the other side the marines
2754074 almond placed under smiths command all army troops in the chosin area effective 0800 the next morning
2754075 including task force faith and all army elements at hagaru ri
2754076 coordinate all forces in and north of hagaru ri in a perimeter defense based on hagaru ri
2754077 general barr who had established an advance command post at hungnam was among those present after the briefing barr whether at almonds suggestion or on his own initiative is not clear flew to hagaru ri
2754078 smith asked hodes to draft a message advising faith that his command was now attached to the 1st marine division
2754079 after almond had departed barr and smith agreed that not much could be done for rct 31
2754080 draft a msg advising faith that his command was now attached to 1mardiv barr at this point was out of the operational chain of command to faith but rct 31 was still of course part of the 7th inf div
2754081 almond shrugged he then directed smith and barr to work out a time phased plan to pull back the three army battalions of rct 31
2754082 the 31st tank company at hudong ni with 1st marine division approval had fallen back to hagaru ri
2754083 the pullout from hudong one thing i recall about hudong is that i had a helluva bad cold felt nasty most of the time reminds me that in my dear lucy letters from untaek telling about maclean having a very bad cold and the regimental surgeon telling him to stay in bed or hed be evacuated anyway whatever sleep we got was at odd hours i recall being snuggled up in my warm sleeping bag in another room someone awakened me could have been rolin skilton in the daylight heard small arms rounds hitting the schoolhouse pulled on boots and some clothes and rushed out the back where a few of us took positons behind the berm that was the incoming being received just before the pullout i believe the reason i dont remember who told us to pull out is because i was asleep at the time however for some reason i have long pointed the finger at anderson who would have acted on the message appleman writes that the order came from hagaru via the tank radio which hodes rode to hagaru the source being bob drake
2754084 until the airstrip was operational aerial evacuation of the most serious cases had been limited to those that could be flown out by the nine helicopters and 10 light aircraft which also had many other missions to perform
2754085 from 27 november to 1 december had lifted out 152 casualties 109 from yudam ni 36 from hagaru ri and 7 from koto ri
2754086 on the morning of 1 december lt col faith on his own initiative began his breakout he did not have a solid radio link to the 1st marine division and had nothing more than a chancy relay through stanfords tactical air control net
2754087 reliance on the automatic weapons fire of the tracked weapons carriers down to three in number two quad 50s and one dual 40mm
2754088 students of chosin continue to wonder why writers continue to say that almond urged smith to destroy equipment when if one studies the details almond did nothing more than authorize smith to destroy
2754089 dr hering the division surgeon reported to smith that among the evacuees was a large number of malingerers unfortunately smith entered in his log there are a good many army men not casualties who got on planes men got on stretchers pulled a blanket over themselves and did a little groaning posing as casualties
2754090 dont let it bother you we had marines in our own outfit who did the same
2754091 there a good many army men not casualties who got on planes
2754092 marines disdainful of the armys performance east of the reservoir learned in the march out from hagaru that soldiers properly led were not much different from themselves

2754095 i had my first sex ed class in 5th sorry im english and i dont know about the american school system
2754096 i dont do things unless i know why i should do them so people like me might start having sex at younger ages because they dont know about the im talking about a fully rounded sex eduction that informs about risks too
2754097 i try to be as honest as possible according to their age and understanding
2754098 shall we have tomatoes tonight do you think daddy wants plain or chocolate would you like to get mummy some milk they look nice shall we have those for tea
2754099 that the time is near when this letter this cry will be known by all in a world of the living
2754100 are we in danger of a fatal crash with another universe
2754101 i do not care about the other 10 500 vacua i only care about the one that describes our universe
2754102 how do you tie down the physics of the multiverse
2754103 to give you a funny example i had an invitation to give a talk at the strings 2008 conference at cern
2754104 the way the invitation was writ ten was of course you are welcome to speak about any topic
2754105 im also working on other very formal very stringy topics which were always part of my skills
2754106 but at this moment people want to know about string cosmology im happily working on it with andreis help
2754107 soon the lhc will start giving new information on particle physics
2754108 but we know it will be difficult to interpret this data unless you also can digest all the data from the sky all the observations from astrophysics and cosmology
2754109 cradle of collaboration will the lhc provide evidence for string theory
2754110 it is certainly the most important experiment of any kind in the past century without qualification
2754111 the most important thing ever in our quest to understand the fundamental laws of nature and the universe
2754112 either the discovery of supersymmetry or extra dimensions is a triumph of string theory
2754113 after a lot of experiments there has not been any hint of susy
2754114 but by the time you look at the whole package of things that should have happened but didnt you start getting a somewhat baroque structure
2754115 it would be a strong indication that there is a string landscape or a multiverse
2754116 i think the majority of opinion would come around to that point of view
2754117 at some point you might just as well say lets fine tune everything and go home
2754118 i think its a logical possibility but if we really have to appeal to anthropic considerations i think thats a big retreat it would mean the explanatory power of theoretical physics would be limited
2754119 my opinion of anthropic reasoning is likely to remain unprintable
2754120 it was probably not the most politic thing to do
2754121 in terms of development of new theories it has been maybe the slowest period in two centuries
2754122 i know for a fact that many of the leading figures in the field read the blogs but so do high school science students
2754123 the scary thing is that frequently you cant tell which is which
2754124 theres some really good stuff but a lot of really sloppy stuff

2754166 the extent of environmental degradation can be overstated or understated the elites of the functional subsystems of modern societies may be inclined to play down the threats whereas green movements are held to exaggerate them luhmann 1986 in general the valuation standards that underlie estimates on environmental quality are not jointly held by the members of a society but differ within groups and possibly even more between nations

2754234 penanaman pohon bakau ini dalam rangka dukungan kita terhadap pelestarian lingkungan hidup khususnya pesisir pantai
2754235 ini merupakan bentuk kemanunggalan tni dengan masyarakat sekarang ini kita tidak lagi mengangkat senjata tapi mengisi pembangunan
2754236 kita tahu wilayah bengkulu terbentang di sepanjang pesisir pantai barat dan rawan gempa yang juga rawan ancaman tsunami makanya kita programkan penanaman 3 000 pohon bakau ini
2754237 andaikata dana itu berhasil dikembalikan ke kas negara dan digunakan untuk program pengentasan kemiskinan atau pemberian beasiswa untuk mahasiswa tak mampu maka manfaatnya akan sangat besar
2754238 kita saat ini menantikan lahirnya pemimpin generasi baru yang bisa disebut angkatan 1998

2754240 kita tidak boleh jago kandang karena kompetitor kita berasal dari negara lain yang sekarang melihat indonesia sebagai pasar yang amat besar
2754241 is the choices we make of which stories we do
2754242 but have hung our hat on doing the longer enterprise and investigative pieces most papers just dont do anymore there is especially a dearth of this kind of coverage from small papers

2754247 i started playing chess at age nine my father encouraged me to play the sport
2754248 i feel proud of myself when i became champion because i did not expect it
2754249 im enjoying a full scholarship now being a varsity scholar i also avail of allowances i also put weight on my academics while i train for chess
2754250 i usually wake up at 5 a m for my regular exercise then im off to school when i return home i go through my home works and study then i give myself two to three hours to play chess before i sleep
2754251 ive met different people from different places with different values and skills in playing chess ive been learning a lot through these experiences
2754252 its really my greatest dream to be the most popular woman chess player in the world
2754253 my husband knew when we heard the second explosion and saw the ball of fire it was the propane place
2754254 for the last six months my daughter has actually been saying to me mom weve got to move this is a dangerous place
2754255 and she said mom one day this place is going to blow
2754256 and our nightmare came true this morning thats exactly what happened
2754257 my son came out freaking out so he must have seen something
2754258 hearing the news was tragic stunning words cant describe it
2754259 how can i help thats all we were thinking we talked about how the best thing we could do was try to play volleyball
2754260 it meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys when we heard from him
2754261 he talked about trying to move on he just told us it will be difficult but together well be much stronger
2754262 we wanted to have a moment of silence where we could gather our thoughts before starting this journey
2754263 it was a moment of silence to honor the bachman family
2754264 the one thing weve always talked about is that this is about a team its not about individual people
2754265 the thing that came across as hugh was talking to us is you know what ive got this happening right now but we came here with a goal in mind and weve invested all this time in it and we need to go out there and try to complete what we started
2754266 it means going out there and playing better every match than we did the previous match
2754267 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2754268 maybe thats why it hurt so much it just felt so close
2754269 the best way we can honor them at this juncture is to go out and compete every day and play hard every day and enjoy and love the game of volleyball and it is a game
2754270 we should be playing it and enjoying it and loving it as they would
2754271 were totally aware that we may see him and we may not
2754272 thats completely all right with us he has other priorities
2754273 but anybody that looks at it as just a one week phenomenon has missed the real point

2754281 we support full inclusion of gay and lesbian families in the life of our nation and seek equal responsibilities benefits and protections for these families in our country marriage has been defined at the state level for 200 years and we believe it should continue to be defined there we repudiate president bushs divisive effort to politicize the constitution by pursuing a federal marriage amendment our goal is to bring americans together not drive them apart
2754282 we support the full inclusion of all families in the life of our nation and support equal responsibility benefits and protections we will enact a comprehensive bipartisan employment non discrimination act we oppose the defense of marriage act and all attempts to use this issue to divide us

2754286 the jurys kind of still out on the impact but it cant be a good impact
2754287 sort of the delta airplane hub of the west in terms of migration
2754288 i told him he was going to hell for robbing a church
2754289 the very purpose of these attacks is all about separating the region from china
2754290 want to use the olympic stage to enlarge the impact
2754291 i heard some bombs and then i heard some machine guns
2754292 we came down to the lobby this morning and it was breakfast as usual
2754293 this doesnt usually happen its happening now because of the olympics but i dont know who is doing it
2754294 all the gold that leaves our village is headed to mali to this one man
2754295 he has the means to take it out we dont
2754296 for a long time hes worked with the white people
2754297 we dont live in the bush so we have nothing to do with child labor

2754300 i buy some grams some kilos from here and there
2754301 service or even accept gold from a mine where children work
2754302 it comes from africa and it arrives in the swiss banks thats all you need to know
2754303 there is a desire to deal with this but the question is how
2754304 home depot can track every 2 by 4 to its forest of origin
2754305 you can track every bag of coffee every diamond to a specific diamond field but for gold theres nothing
2754306 if i have one wish its that i might someday have a little bit of money
2754307 sometimes i dream that one day ill own something made of gold

2754314 diferenciar el largo plazo y los sorprendentes pasos que se dan a corto plazo entender el largo plazo permite comprender lo que supone la revoluci n digital
2754315 nuestro propio cuerpo de hecho est construido por peque os ordenadores en las proteinas el actual estadio de la investigaci n sobre la fabricaci n digital consiste en que los ordenadores no controlen las herramientas sino que sean herramientas y que los programas no dise en cosas sino que sean las cosas
2754316 la clave es que cuando la gente puede crear su propia tecnolog a es entonces cuando se despierta la pasi n la soluci n no es solo una mejor educaci n o software m s amigable sino dar la posibilidad de que la gente pueda crear tecnolog a por s mismos
2754317 la expresi n de internet 0 nace precisamente del proyecto media house que se llev a cabo en barcelona se levant una estructura con la idea de una vivienda programable basada en microchips que son servidores web sensores que controlan la energ a y pueden comunicarse de muy distintas maneras cuestan un d lar el nombre de internet 0 procede del empleo de una comunicaci n lenta para hacer m s f cil su implementaci n lo que los dispositivos hacen en la internet 0 se acerca m s al c digo morse el usado en telegraf a
2754318 el coste no est en los dispositivos sino en la red si hay que rehacerla
2754319 el pr ximo paso es integrar cosas en una red de comunicaci n sta es la visi n de una verdadera red ubicua en cualquier lugar a cualquier hora por cualquier persona y con cualquier cosa
2754320 las rfid tienen bastantes problemas el mayor es que el usuario puede leer la etiqueta pero necesitar a un ej rcito de consultores para programar una y hacer algo con ella el actual rfid no tiene nada que ver con internet pero en el mundo del internet 0 el usuario puede comunicarse f sicamente con las etiquetas porque ah cada etiqueta tiene una funci n y est en la red las rfid est n aisladas en el vac o en el internet 0 las etiquetas son un paquete f sico que forma parte de la red y ello rebaja las preocupaciones sobre la privacidad

2754331 unlike others u s defends freedom to offend in speech
2754332 in much of the developed world one uses racial epithets at ones legal peril one displays nazi regalia and the other trappings of ethnic hatred at significant legal risk and one urges discrimination against religious minorities under threat of fine or imprisonment
2754333 urges terrorist violence to an audience some of whose members are ready to act on the urging
2754334 the problem with so called hate speech laws is that theyre not about facts
2754335 what were learning here is really the bedrock difference between the united states and the countries that are in a broad sense its legal cousins
2754336 western governments are becoming increasingly comfortable with the regulation of opinion the first amendment really does distinguish the u s not just from canada but from the rest of the western world

2754341 ich hatte einen sehr guten start und habe versucht eine l cke auf nico h lkenberg herauszufahren besonders am anfang gab es sehr viele gelbe flaggen und nico war sehr schnell deshalb kam ich nicht weg gegen ende des rennens waren meine reifen nicht mehr optimal und ich habe mich darauf konzentriert das rennen nach hause zu fahren
2754342 mein start war nicht optimal da ich mit meinen reifen auf der wei en linie keinen grip bekommen habe
2754343 in den ersten runden des rennens war ich noch zuversichtlich jules berholen zu k nnen allerdings gab es sehr viele gelbe flaggen was einen angriff unm glich machte je l nger es dauerte umso schwieriger wurde es auf jules druck auszu ben da meine reifen abbauten
2754344 mein start war nahezu perfekt ich bin von startplatz sieben direkt auf rang drei vorgefahren insgesamt bin ich sehr zufrieden mit dem wochenende und gl cklich dass mein team art alle podiumspl tze belegt
2754345 washington ap russias use of overwhelming military force against georgia including strategic bombers and ballistic missiles is disproportionate to any threat from the former soviet state and could escalate tensions in the volatile region a senior u s official said saturday

2754378 cyber attacks against georgia would be militarily appropriate considering that they are reportedly sending 150 tanks and associated troops i mean peace keepers across the border and for that matter georgia has probably studied russias cyber techniques and prepared its own strategic cyber attack capability what does that mean for the rest of the world it means we should prepare for spill over effects there may be ddos attacks against web sites or news outlets that are covering the current conflict either side might start messing with the internet routing tables the way pakistan did last january when youtube was taken off the internet by an engineer at a pakistani isp cnn foxnews and the like could find their voices silenced think about your reliance on critical web based resources prepare alternatives that would be wise at anytime but during major world events it makes even more sense
2754379 is it really wise to shut down or reduce the bandwidth of the official websites which provide the should i say official propaganda or government point of view to the world media is it wiser to establish mirror websites around the world i think voa has several mirrored websites on different subnets and feed them via satellite in case of total knock out or is it still better to have couple of 250kw ionosphere heaters shortwave transmitters ready just in case ill bet the voa mirrored system would have been down in case of us ussr nuclear war but hf shortwave would have worked with smaller units of course when the ionosphere has stabilized after those high altitude detonations it is extremely interesting to monitor this current situation
2754380 we are not alone and we know what we need to say from our websites and laptops the street corners and coffeehouses the delis and diners the factory floors and the bookstores on campus at the mall the synagogue sanctuary and mosque lets tell it where we can when we can and while we still can
2754381 es war gut nach der schlechten saison und dem ausstieg beim ironman frankfurt anfang juli mit einem guten rennen in die weitere hawaii vorbereitung zu gehen
2754382 wir haben in den vergangenen tagen und wochen gesehen dass wir so nicht weiterkommen wir lassen uns aber von den brasilianern nicht verarschen
2754383 da k nnen sie noch zehnmal weltmeister werden so etwas tut man nicht rafinha spielt bei olympia ohne unsere freigabe das lassen wir nicht l nger zu
2754384 our grand old musharraf has not been passing on all the one billion dollar a year that the americans have been giving for the armed forces we re talking about 700 million a year missing the rest has been taken by mush for some scheme or other and weve got to find it
2754385 es war f r beide seiten der richtige zeitpunkt f r eine trennung wir haben stets gut zusammengearbeitet aber die sportliche situation l sst keinen anderen weg als eine trennung zu

2754387 es f llt nun das alibi weg sie muss zeigen dass sie es besser kann die gro artigen fans denen ich auf diesem weg ebenfalls ein gro es dankesch n sagen m chte haben es verdient
2754388 schlie lich hat jens ja an berlin nur beste erinnerungen
2754389 salim hamdan was working for a bad organization and he knew that
2754390 i think we all had to reconcile that before we got on the plane
2754391 the defense would say the accused made the mistake of being in the wrong place at the wrong time
2754392 the prosecutors would give the image of him being a hardened terrorist
2754393 it came down to the evidence that we were allowed to see
2754394 i thought it was unusual considering the crimes he was accused of i know there are people who hate people or entities
2754395 the reality is he didnt have to get up at all he could have just sat there
2754396 the penalty should be so significant that it forecloses any possibility that he renews his ties with terrorism
2754397 unless you can say we should have hanged him are you going to make that same statement of every individual
2754398 just as we adhere to the geneva convention and we try to set the standards with the sanctity of human rights
2754399 you have to trust the government to a certain degree
2754400 i would take their word for it because yes i do believe in the government
2754401 ich kann mir nicht vorstellen dass jens in der nationalelf mit der niederlage im em finale aufh ren will es gibt die m glichkeit dass er zum abschied in einem freundschaftsspiel zum einsatz kommt
2754402 ich habe mich mit marcelinho unterhalten und er hat sich klar ge u ert es liegt noch kein konkretes angebot vor aber es kann sein dass ich mich in der n chsten woche damit besch ftigen muss

2754405 those who had the honour of knowing master cpl roberts describe him as the embodiment of a brother in the truest sense of the word
2754406 truth honour and loyalty were not mere words to josh but the unspoken creed by which he lived his life josh would be there for his friends at any time to lend a hand or to give them honest advice sometimes it was not the advice they wanted to hear but it was always the advice they needed
2754407 the kind of guy that we would describe as the soldiers soldier
2754408 was always carrying his share and more and always looking out for his buddies and comrades any which way
2754409 he had been extremely patient and always kept a sense of humour about it
2754410 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2754411 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2754412 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2754413 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2754414 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2754415 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2754416 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2754417 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2754418 i believe in compulsory cannibalism if people were forced to eat what they killed there would be no more wars

2754420 high level of optimism is out of sync with reality the companys research shows that 7 7 of u s homes depreciated in value over the past year
2754421 a bill being advanced by the democratic leadership would allow the government to listen to millions of phone calls by americans with neither an individualized warrant nor an assessment of probable cause
2754422 although the law would offer some protection when a particular american was expressly targeted even then the proposed rules fall short of what the fourth amendment mandates
2754423 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
2754424 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq
2754425 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
2754426 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
2754427 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
2754428 jesus call required them to leave behind some pretty valuable stuff right there on the beach
2754429 you may think of your answer while i share mine
2754430 this is the kind of assessment that you could really spend an hour on in this session we simply want to introduce you to the idea lets take a few minutes to individually answer the questions and then well pair up to share what we find
2754431 virtual item trading is already transforming the way people experience mmogs and virtual worlds but in its traditional underground context the impact could be as easily negative as positive for a given player or world an economy this large clearly needs a legitimate trading infrastructure that serves the needs of each of its millions of participants
2754432 live gamer has developed a platform with all the integrity security and professionalism of any real world marketplace and were working hand in hand with publishers to ensure a positive experience for every player
2754433 virtual trading has the potential to open an entirely new dimension for the player experience in some games but it has also caused endless grief through the actions of gold farmers and fraud artists as well as the generally poor quality of service to participants live gamer makes it possible for publishers to satisfy players growing demand for this type of activity in selected future games by providing a legitimate and balanced outlet that protects their experiences we really look forward to offering this opportunity to players in our upcoming casual mmog
2754434 basically second life is a public marketplace and when were talking about private confidential or secure transactions we need to make sure that those happen outside of a public marketplace in a secure environment
2754435 however if the dialogue progresses to the point of sales this would be handled by a more secure traditional method such as over the phone or via ibms web site
2754436 we are very early in the life of 3d virtual worlds and especially in leveraging those worlds to accomplish real business

2754445 the turner prize was my first opportunity to bet when i could have an effect my odds were seven to two in a four horse race that is an insult i had absolutely no choice im sure it is solely because of the bets i put on myself that i went from being the underdog to the favorite i wont say how much i took home but won more from betting than i did from winning what was then a twenty thousand pound prize
2754446 we know that 2d environments are not as compelling as they used to be

2754490 a light will shine down from somewhere it will light upon you you will experience an epiphany and you will say to yourself i have to vote for barack
2754491 so you can throw abortion out the window because you dont like bush and the war
2754492 no but you put up with the imperfections of politicians nobody is perfect
2754493 have you ever discussed her positions on abortion and homosexual marriage with her
2754494 do you allow her to come to holy communion after the church has taught that manifest public sinners who are unrepentant are to be denied holy communion
2754495 i think the archbishop of st louis would disagree and hes a canon lawyer
2754496 yeah well i happen to be a canon lawyer too yknow and i think the bishops who said that are in a very minority position
2754497 is that how we decide truth even our holy father has said that truth is not determined by majority opinion
2754498 you sound like somebody who at the time of jesus would have said why is he sitting and eating with these public sinners
2754499 hopefully to convert them do you plan on doing anything to try to convert nancy pelosi
2754500 im certainly not going to convert her but i certainly will have an opportunity to talk with her as i had an opportunity to talk with our own congressman here mike thompson
2754501 do you plan on discussing any of these issues with her
2754502 im going to look for that opportunity ive only met her outside of church for about two minutes im not about to refuse her communion because if i did that id have to take a litmus test on everybody we have people there that are totally against immigrants and all this stuff
2754503 but how many of them are people that take a public stance seen by the entire free world supporting the infanticide of children there have been over 40 million children killed by abortion
2754504 i think you have my take on this and its been good talking to you
2754505 well you need to understand that father is not much of a scholar however he has a tremendous ability for pastoral care
2754506 since we lowly we cant do anything about the country
2754507 we need to put our empty hopes in obamas empty hands
2754508 thats the biggest thing relax and be on time be ready to hit just contribute to the team regardless of whether im in the lineup if im contributing wherever its not only going to help the team its going to help get us going

2754517 blood doping reduces fatigue by increasing the supply of oxygen to the exercising muscles
2754518 this will not increase the maximum force the muscle can generate but will permit the muscle to do more work for longer
2754519 people most interested in blood doping would be distance runners from probably 800 meters and up swimmers in the long races cyclists for sure perhaps people in rowing or in the triathlon so those would be the sports that just kind of pop right out
2754520 the amount of improvement would be clearly enough to give you a substantial edge in international competitions if you were an elite athlete
2754521 the difference between endogenous epo and recombinant human epo is not very big
2754522 what carsten has confirmed what people sort of thought was going on is that it would be possible for most people to use low doses of the stuff epo enough to get an edge
2754523 so somebody could cheat on monday and if the drug testers came on wednesday 48 hours might be enough for the stuff to be gone
2754524 some of these compounds have short acting periods of time in the body but the biological effects the positive effects on performance can be weeks or months
2754525 the cheaters are in a constant cat and mouse game with the authorities
2754526 theyre always changing their strategies in an effort to beat the tests
2754527 the fear with blood doping or epo use is that the blood count gets too high the blood gets too thick and it becomes hard for the heart to push the blood around the body or that somehow this high blood count contributes to somebody having or a blood clot
2754528 if somebody has an exceptional performance they must be cheating because there have been examples of exceptional performances when people were cheating
2754529 so every unusual performance every breakthrough performance every record somehow the question becomes is it real or to what extent did doping contribute to this and you just dont know
2754530 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
2754531 what she rhonda will treasure the most is the fact that she was his wife for 30 years and not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly
2754532 to expect that all the world should and must adopt the pecular political institutions of the united states which often do not work very well even at home is to indulge in the most unrealistic of visions yet just that seems to be the hope and expectation of many neoconservatives such foreign policies are such stuff as dreams are made on yet they lead to the heaps of corpses of men who died in vain

2754549 its not about the terrorists its about us its about what kind of country we are
2754550 is to make it clear to the world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the international convention of torture whether it be here at home or abroad
2754551 the signing statement is saying i will only comply with this law when i want to and if something arises in the war on terrorism where i think its important to torture or engage in cruel inhuman and degrading conduct i have the authority to do so and nothing in this law is going to stop me
2754552 the cia should have the ability to use additional techniques
2754553 the practice of shipping away prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far off countries of detaining thousands without charge or trial of maintaining a network of secret prisons to jail people beyond the reach of the law
2754554 i would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of the republicans as a partisan witch hunt because i think weve got too many problems to solve
2754555 prosecution of any officials if it were to occur would probably not occur during obamas first term
2754556 instead we may well see a congressionally empowered commission that would seek testimony from witnesses in search of the truth about what occurred though some witnesses might be offered immunity in exchange for testimony the question of whether anybody would be prosecuted would be deferred to a later date meaning obamas second term if such is forthcoming
2754557 the commission would focus strictly on detention torture and extraordinary rendition or the practice of spiriting detainees to a third country for abusive interrogations the panel would focus strictly on these abuses leaving out any other allegedly illegal activities during the bush administration such as domestic spying

2754581 we really thought mark wasnt going to make it back from injury
2754582 centre back was an area where we were weak last year and hes an outstanding player i cannot honestly believe how we got him why we got him but im absolutely delighted i think hes a premier league player
2754583 matt holland has a lot of competition in central midfield this year so that decision to make hudson captain was straightforward for me
2754584 it was a difficult game at times swansea kept the ball well with some high quality passing but we did well and did not have too many scary moments
2754585 usually you look at that first game and get an indication of what sort of season a club are going to have last year we never gave ourselves breathing space at home and had that crucial period last year against watford and bristol city where we led but couldnt give ourselves victory so that second goal was very important to us
2754586 i think they play monday and i think tony pulis will have to make a decision before saturday
2754587 i think its difficult for him now i think if he does come back to us were going to have to build bridges with everyone here and get him playing to his best as hes a good player
2754588 charlton are probably the favourites to get promoted and so after that i dont think too many of us are worried about playing in the championship
2754589 causing six medical doctors to hospitalise her for five days in order to avoid ioc controls
2754590 a scandalous saga which cast a most negative shadow over the 2004 olympic games at the time of their opening ceremony
2754591 it is these totalitarian practices and decisions that bring the sporting spirit and the olympic ideal that my country gave birth to into disrepute
2754592 the ioc decision is completely unfair they do not respect the law
2754593 this is the wrong message to send to society this decision has been taken with no legal basis and with no legal merits
2754594 it is simply unfair and discriminatory to allow specific athletes with admission and bans for the use of prohibited substances to participate in the olympics but not ms thanou
2754595 this situation must now come to an end and those responsible for such a decision must come to the understanding that there are rules and laws that need to be followed
2754596 we have accepted and respected decisions by courts and they have to do the same

2754606 although dating is a major preoccupation of the vast number of single twenty and thirtysomethings its hard to think of a group that so completely chooses to live in a neighborhood based on dating opportunities as the citys young orthodox jews and the upper west side an increasingly orthodox enclave has over the past four decades emerged as courting central for modern orthodox singles from across the country and around the world

2754608 baruch november an english professor and poet from pittsburgh who moved to the upper west side five years ago put it this way its like all roads lead to the west side
2754609 but while the upper west side may offer an expanded pool of singles some say its social offerings can distract from the presumed goal of marriage the lifestyle sometimes resembles a relatively chaste version of that depicted in the television series sex and the city featuring below the knee designer skirts and kosher wine in place of cosmopolitans

2754698 es un apuesta de xito y el olimpismo crecer seg n l si los juegos se organizan en la capital de espa a
2754699 madrid vincula el olimpismo con valores de los que todos participamos desarrollo urbano sostenible educaci n respeto por el medio ambiente y humanismo y eso supone un gran impulso para el olimpismo si se organizan los juegos en madrid el deporte espa ol dar un gran salto cualitativo y eso es importante para todas ciudades y tambi n para barcelona barcelona convirti ese sue o en realidad y siempre estuvo acompa ada ahora est is acompa ados con el calor y el fervor de la capital ol mpica de barcelona
2754700 ha habido mucha controversia pero cuando los atletas han empezado a participar esas controversias han empezado a desaparecer
2754701 quiero desear mucha suerte y xito a sus deportistas que han trabajado muy duro estos a os he tenido la oportunidad de vivir unos juegos y s que la vida no sigue igual despu s de esta experiencia madrid necesita ese elemento catalizador para incrementar ese aspecto humano madrid quiere organizar los juegos ol mpicos y paral mpicos es el momento de madrid espero verles en madrid en 2016

2754703 con el objetivo prioritario de beneficiar a los agricultores profesionales y a los propietarios cuyas tierras est n incluidas dentro de espacios calificados como red natura
2754704 todos los propietarios de zonas afectadas como red natura tendr n prioridad a la hora de recibir ayudas pero ser a cambio de que realicen alg n tipo de medida productiva que posibilite alguna mejora medioambiental no por el simple hecho de que su terreno est afectado por dicha calificaci n
2754705 que incidir n tambi n en el objetivo de luchar contra la desertizaci n
2754706 the operation will enter the next phase as planned and you will learn about that
2754707 we do not intend to take the initiative in escalating the conflict in this region we are primarily interested in stabilisation in abkhazia
2754708 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
2754709 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2754710 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2754711 we have verified information that the russians are planning to attack zugdidi in several hours georgian parliament speaker david bakradze said referring to a georgian controlled city near abkhazia
2754712 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of goodwill and our willingness to stop military confrontation georgian national security council secretary alexander lomaia told afp
2754713 we have asked united states secretary of state condoleezza rice to mediate with the russians to transmit them our message he said
2754714 disproportionate and dangerous escalation of the conflict could significantly harm relations between washington and moscow
2754715 this is definitely necessary for preventing arms shipments to georgia by sea interfax quoted a naval source as saying
2754716 a sea blockade of georgia will also help avert an escalation of military activity in abkhazia
2754717 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognised borders and urges russia to respect them said a statement released by france
2754718 underscores that the military actions against georgia could affect eu russian relations it added
2754719 the navy was ordered not to allow supplies of weapons and military hardware into georgia by sea
2754720 the georgians have dug in at the heights and they dont want to leave our fighters aided by the russians have been trying to flush them out of there
2754721 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2754722 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions
2754723 russias aid arrived a bit too late and the town was completely destroyed we dont have tskhinvali anymore
2754724 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2754725 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2754726 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2754727 im a little put out that as someone who has actively promoted and used their service and even encouraged my readers to advertise on them that they simply banned me
2754728 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it
2754729 jai parl kaka hier samedi nous savons que les deux clubs sont en discussions au sujet du transfert mais ils ne sont pas encore parvenus un accord

2754740 im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2754741 a possible scenario is that theyll try and get some cash involved centricas balance sheet is good and it has no debt so theyve got room to manoeuvre in that regard
2754742 the comments from the government suggested to centrica that they have to put a cash element in there
2754743 the moral influence which may be a powerful force with civilized

2754747 due to the many caution periods it was a very difficult race for a time it appeared as if it would be very difficult for us to win however with a really good performance and thanks to audi tdi power we were able to achieve the result we wanted im happy for the team that we brought home this double victory and it was also a very nice audi d but for marcel f ssler
2754748 the strategy that we had in our minds before the race did not work out because of the many yellows nevertheless i was able to pull away quite well unfortunately we always lost the advantage we had due to the caution periods thank god in the end it was still enough to win im more than happy marcel f ssler must also be praised it was his first race with this car and he was able to catch the two acura hondas and thus make the audi 1 2 victory perfect this was again a great race weekend thanks to the team of audi sport north america to the boys at home and michelin
2754749 a beautiful 50th race the race was not easy especially after the penultimate restart with the two acura hondas in front of me behind these cars we lost a lot of down force so it was incredibly difficult to close the gap to them once i even went off the track at the end it worked well thanks to audi tdi power we got the acura hondas on the straights it was a nice race i spent a lot of time in the car it was a lot of fun
2754750 this was a very special race for me the final restart was unbelievable it was pretty close between brabham and the wall but i said to myself now or never it worked out i am very happy that i was able to give the second place to the team it ran very well from the beginning i am satisfied generally speaking the atmosphere at audi and in the american le mans series is perfect
2754751 im really happy it was a very good and interesting race with many yellows some helped us some did not help us i think we did a good job marcel f ssler drove very well and integrated really well into the team there is nothing to complain about and we can go home with a smile on our faces
2754752 this was a perfect day with excellent driving from all our drivers the team did not make any mistakes our strategy and pit stops were also good and both marco and marcel made great passes at the end of the race
2754753 has been poorly thought through badly implemented and has produced many unintended costs that will linger for years if not decades but blanket criticism of bush misses an important reality
2754754 come on guy give him a break he just got off the dl disabled list hes hurt
2754755 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2754756 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2754757 that attitude undermines the core of american values its one thing if your neighbor makes a disparaging remark but if your public official makes it its absolutely unacceptable

2754760 we had a winning car today but the yellow flags came out at just the wrong time and they seemed to last for ages i was clearly faster than the winner david brabham but when you are stuck behind a pace car you cant pass anyone
2754761 our strategy to play off the efficiency of our engine against our competitors would have worked under normal circumstances but today we simply didnt have luck on our side

2754779 the kafka industry doesnt want to know such things about its idol
2754780 i desire to state a couple of things that i feel are of moment to argue right now
2754781 i only put enough money in the parking meter for two hours
2754782 maar wat we w l weten is dat we deze
2754783 uit de grond van ons hart kunnen aanraden het is muziek gemaakt op gemanipuleerd speelgoed
2754784 im aware that researchers from the university of southampton have applied to plant some gm poplar on our land
2754785 were still considering their request but havent given a definitive answer
2754786 our concerns with gm trees are even more serious than crops because trees are very long lived
2754787 they are inherently geared up for spreading seeds and pollen because of they way the reproduce
2754788 it could have a really negative impact and cause widespread ecological damage
2754789 our concern is that biofuels will distract people away from other solutions
2754790 kita boleh lihat bagaimana besi buruk yang dulunya tiada nilai tetapi kini menjadi sasaran pencuri selepas mempunyai harga yang tinggi begitu juga najis lembu jika kita meletakkan nilai padanya
2754791 langkah ini juga umpama serampang dua mata kerana dasar kerajaan negeri mahu mempertingkatkan pengeluaran industri asas tani sekali gus ia mampu menjimatkan kos membeli baja yang kini meningkat tiga hingga empat kali ganda sekampit
2754792 saya juga sudah meminta jpv negeri menjalankan kajian berhubung cadangan itu termasuk menentukan lokasi pusat pengumpulan najis lembu yang sesuai dan strategik di setiap mukim
2754793 saya yakin sekiranya cadangan ini berjaya direalisasikan ia mampu memberi banyak manfaat terutama kepada penternak lembu sekali gus membantu kita membersihkan jalan raya di negeri ini daripada najis itu

2754798 if you or your family have no urgent need to remain in georgia you should leave as soon as possible it is wise to do so while some air services are still available and the border remains open
2754799 any ancient deeply rooted autonomous culture especially if it is spread on a wide part of the earths surface constitutes an autonomous world full of riddles and surprises to western thinking for one thousand years russia has belonged to such a category

2754803 it is true that i met with ars ne wenger there were very positive talks
2754804 i do not rule out anybody completely at the moment if we were in advanced negotiations with anybody else i would say no so everything is possible right now
2754805 the hunza visit provides affirmation of our ties to the former macedonia of alexander the great approval from these people confirms that the legacy of ancient macedonia belongs to the republic of macedonia not just to greece
2754806 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
2754807 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
2754808 we have to realise that by following the unwritten code we are denying
2754809 the muslim psyche can be baffling to a non muslim he can never know all the nuances have the feel for the culture
2754810 the muslim psyche can be baffling to non muslims however much a person claims to be in tune with what the community feels he can never really know all the nuances a muslim on the other hand would have the feel for the language the metaphor and the culture if you have to know what is happening in aligarh muslim university or simi a muslim will be much better informed and you cannot wish away the feeling of neglect the hurt and the discrimination that the community feels that too is something a muslim would be able to understand better
2754811 there was some discussion within the ib before the doors were thrown open the bottomline for us was that only merit would be the criterion as intelligence officials our backgrounds are checked periodically it applies to everyone irrespective of religious or ethnic identities
2754812 religion cannot be a criterion india is a country of minorities and this is the strength of the nation
2754813 they could identify with the sensibilities of the kashmiris and were much more sensitive in their approach which paid off in 1994 95 when militancy was at its height in fact these officers helped us counter the pakistani propaganda that was dominant in the kashmir valley during that time
2754814 these have been traditionally weak areas for us and the induction of muslim officers could help us but we have to also side step the narrow vision of hiring muslims in islamic states and just look at them as professionals
2754815 mishra said he would look into hiring muslims but did nothing about it
2754816 i asked him if we could induct muslims into the organisations that were being set up he promised us that he would look into it i never heard from him after that
2754817 he heard us out and gave instructions that there should be no discrimination on the basis of religion while recruiting competent officers days later he passed away and the instructions were not recorded on file and did not become official policy so things continue to be the way they were
2754818 i would emphasise that religion must not be a criterion we have had an eminent chief of air staff in idrees latif and lt general jameel was army commander of eastern command while lt gen zaki was security advisor to the j amp k government at a critical period of militancy in the early 1990s india is a country of minorities whether religious ethnic linguistic or caste and this is the strength of the nation
2754819 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2754820 we are trying to cool off the tankers to keep them from getting any worse building up more pressure and potentially exploding so there is definitely some danger for our personnel right there
2754821 hearing the news was tragic stunning words cant describe it
2754822 how can i help thats all we were thinking we talked about how the best thing we could do was try to play volleyball
2754823 it meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys when we heard from him
2754824 he talked about trying to move on he just told us it will be difficult but together well be much stronger
2754825 we wanted to have a moment of silence where we could gather our thoughts before starting this journey
2754826 it was a moment of silence to honor the bachman family
2754827 the one thing weve always talked about is that this is about a team its not about individual people
2754828 the thing that came across as hugh was talking to us is you know what ive got this happening right now but we came here with a goal in mind and weve invested all this time in it and we need to go out there and try to complete what we started
2754829 it means going out there and playing better every match than we did the previous match
2754830 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2754831 maybe thats why it hurt so much it just felt so close
2754832 the best way we can honor them at this juncture is to go out and compete every day and play hard every day and enjoy and love the game of volleyball and it is a game
2754833 we should be playing it and enjoying it and loving it as they would
2754834 were totally aware that we may see him and we may not
2754835 thats completely all right with us he has other priorities
2754836 id much rather be sitting on the bench telling him what i think he should be doing rather than where i am now
2754837 i think the blue skies will come especially after todays rain
2754838 today is raining and tomorrow will have rain too that will help reduce the air pollution level we believe the current air flow will be helpful in the dispersion of pollutants in the air
2754839 you can control beijing as much as you like but youre not going to see much of an effect
2754840 on the day of opening ceremonies we had rain clouds in the southwest and northwest they were moving closer to the birds nest and there was a high probability of rain
2754841 there is no point in speaking about referees they like the attention
2754842 i think other people need to comment on it because people are watching how managers react
2754843 when you hear of referees summits with managers pictures up on screens talking about individual managers you shake your head and wonder what is going on in the game
2754844 but i refuse to comment and give the limelight to the referee
2754845 i will talk about st mirren players i thought the st mirren players were outstanding from the first minute to the last
2754846 if they play that way for the rest of the season we will be delighted
2754847 we asked them to be brave and play the ball and maybe with a bit of luck we could have taken something from the game
2754848 the obvious beneficiaries of weaker oil and a firmer us dollar are global stock markets as the us has been the rocky horror show in terms of concerns it is now one of the more obvious candidates for a relief short covering rally
2754849 policy responses to the credit crunch have helped to successfully get out of a financial squeeze you need three things 1 a cheap currency 2 a positive yield curve and 3 the recapitalization of bank balance sheets with surprising speed all three of these conditions are now being met in the us
2754850 bull markets are born on pessimism grow on skepticism mature on optimism and die on euphoria
2754851 eurozone gdp almost certainly contracted in q2 eurostat will release its flash estimate on august 14 the same day that germany and france release their own first estimates if the numbers surprise on the downside the markets will start anticipating a rate cut by the ecb on september 4
2754852 europe has moved further along the road towards a recession than the us the economic data of the past two weeks make that conclusion hard to avoid
2754853 ik heb de notie van onzichtbaarheid tot een volgend logisch uiterste gedreven we doen veel waanzinnige dingen die een stuk verder gaan dan wat tot nu toe is bereikt
2754854 all the gold that leaves our village is headed to mali to this one man
2754855 he has the means to take it out we dont
2754856 for a long time hes worked with the white people
2754857 we dont live in the bush so we have nothing to do with child labor
2754858 i can assure you that what he declares is only a fraction of what is going out
2754859 if i am wrong you can cut off my head and put it on a platter
2754860 i buy some grams some kilos from here and there
2754861 service or even accept gold from a mine where children work
2754862 it comes from africa and it arrives in the swiss banks thats all you need to know
2754863 there is a desire to deal with this but the question is how
2754864 home depot can track every 2 by 4 to its forest of origin
2754865 you can track every bag of coffee every diamond to a specific diamond field but for gold theres nothing
2754866 if i have one wish its that i might someday have a little bit of money
2754867 sometimes i dream that one day ill own something made of gold
2754868 but im shopping at whole foods it all must be healthy good organic
2754869 the coin must have been done by a professional the work is impressive
2754870 i know thisll be a tight album but let me just listen to it anyway
2754871 strangely this year there are no out riders competing on any team
2754872 there is one rider who is married but is having an affair with a guy but so far hes not coming forward about it sad
2754873 you spend a day with these athletes and it becomes obvious that gay people are everywhere
2754874 the reason many of them arent out is because theyre focused on their job during this time when sports is the no 1 thing in their lives
2754875 she is religious and close to her mother she is also somewhat shy and fragile this beijing thing is going to be a major cultural shock she came out of nowhere and went from nothing to this but when she does come out and she will she will be an incredible role model
2754876 came in several times along with most of the team she never made a big deal about who she was or where she was going and of course seeing female athletes in the bar was commonplace she hooked up occasionally and i watched her make out a few times
2754877 i think that those who keep their sexuality secret and act overly heterosexual hinder the sport
2754878 my experience shows there are no more gay men competing in gymnastics than in any other sport
2754879 i think that for closeted elite gymnasts not only are they scared to be a role model for gay youth they are afraid that coming out will confirm the perception that they compete in a gay sport the misconceptions are so far from the truth gymnastics is one of the toughest hardest and most gruelingly difficult sports in the world
2754880 when the river runs red take the dirt track instead
2754881 i told martha we never do things the easy way
2754882 we like to fight and the most important day will be in two days

2754991 weve been playing together so long now we tend to know where each others going to be what type of balls the other one likes to play and theyre ability
2754992 i think theyre good enough to go to quarter finals i think we knew that
2754993 but then whats really important is to make the players perform at their best level individually so they leave everything out there on the field and not let the nerves or intensity destroy that focus
2754994 that has been my focus so far it goes well
2754995 kara has really bloomed the last couple of months both as a wide player and as a target striker and her ball skills have really significantly become better
2754996 her fitness level is excellent her headers are better than ever before she is just more dangerous in the box
2754997 swedens definitely one of the top teams in the world
2754998 i dont think their results necessarily show how good they are with this last game meaning so much for them i think theyre going to come out very strong and i think itll probably be our toughest game of the tournament theyre a physical team were both big theres going to be some bruises after
2754999 theyll be a thriving democracy and a us ally the first arab nation on our side

2755005 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2755006 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2755007 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2755008 do not just tell me today is the 27th may 2008 you should say its the day oaluw is coming back even then so what until you can guarantee me that i will get to see her tomorrow its no big deal just yet i just hope she has reached already and that shes safe and sound not too tired out
2755009 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2755010 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2755011 during my time searching the archives i came across a piece televised by tvnz just prior to the release of my first the lord of the rings locations guidebook in 2002 ive put it up on my site in the iblog section and thought your visitors might like to see it it was never shown outside of middle earth aotearoa and it gives a glimpse of some of the locations
2755012 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2755013 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2755014 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2755049 cristinas idea that only unfulfilled love could be romantic is sad
2755050 her notion that love has to be this complicated and tumultuous tug of war to be real that seems so exhausting to me
2755051 i could really appreciate her seize the day attitude she is so open to life and all of its adventures and all of its quirks and ready to go along for the ride i think thats the most attractive part of her character
2755052 as far as getting into bed with a stranger and all of that its nice to think that wouldnt end like disaster maybe ive watched too many of a amp es true crime series the first 48 to know what it could end up as but i think its very idyllic i think that part of me is that way
2755053 my mom is a romantic person and i think i inherited that from her there are many different ways that you can be romantic theres of course the romance that you have with your partner your love and then theres that thoughtfulness that you have with others remembering what people like and what they appreciate and wanting them to experience it and enjoy it thats romantic to me in a way

2755067 i had no idea when you interviewed me that you considered much of my later work to be sentimental rubbish or that you thought songs like uptown girl and we didnt start the fire were abominations and your back slapping buddy buddy style of conversation betrayed no indication that you actually compared talking with me to sleeping with an inflatable girlfriend
2755068 you didnt bring any of this up during the interview and i certainly would have welcomed the opportunity to discuss those kinds of things person to person i believe that its always best to be upfront with someone when you have strong opinions about their work or their image simply as a gesture of respect or if the respect isnt there then purely as professionalism had i known you felt this way i still would have done the bloody interview but your comments reveal you to be already critically predisposed and somewhat insincere you are still welcome to attend our concert in auckland but just as a safety precaution please wear a hockey mask
2755069 ive had letters before from the bass player in some local band who is pissed off because i said his record is crap but ive never had a letter from someone in the big league before its actually made him go up in my estimation he just wants respect for his work and i think good on him for making direct contact he was great to talk to and no matter what i think of those songs other people clearly love them because hes sold over 150 million records
2755070 my girlfriend thinks im crazy cuz my shoe box stacks are taller than she is

2755102 we dont live in the bush so we have nothing to do with child labor

2755121 to play the world no 2 in the first game of the olympics and come away with a 2 all tie we are to a degree satisfied
2755122 i am not so happy with the result because first we were winning five minutes before finishing the game
2755123 when we saw the number of shot corners we had and the number of penetrations we had we had more than the u s a
2755124 the team have to look forward because its the first game and we had a point
2755125 we were a little bit on the back foot to start and argentina made us pay for that
2755126 our team is known to persist throughout the game regardless of the situation or the time or phase of the game

2755130 in the context of the announcement by the abkhaz de facto authorities of a military operation in the upper kodori valley which could be dangerously destabilizing i am calling for the exercise of maximum restraint by all concerned as well as the guarantee of the safety and security of the unarmed united nations military observers
2755131 all parties to immediately end hostilities and to engage without delay in negotiations to achieve a peaceful settlement

2755137 calling the space an artist collective seems to be a misnomer

2755140 when the ball is in my hands im capable of doing some great things

2755142 when he gets the ball in his hands he looks like he can do a lot of things he caught one pass did a spin move and spun away from some people it was electrifying for me because i know i cant do it so it was pretty cool to watch it
2755143 a great opportunity for me to get out there and get some balls from donovan and go with the rest of the guys and have some fun it was awesome just the environment it was great its a big opportunity for me to come into the nfl and play with a great team like this
2755144 just a fake reverse to catch the defense off guard a little bit
2755145 one of those kind of trick plays whatever i have to do to help this team out and be successful ill do
2755146 he did some nice things and hes got a couple of things he has to correct
2755147 he made some plays but he has to be a little sharper and crisper on a couple of things we did out there that goes for everybody you saw his hands and the way he can run routes he is very good at making moves
2755148 the biggest thing for me right now is experience the more experience i get the more comfortable ill be and the better i will do it i just keep working hard
2755149 in college the return is there you get a little more time to get off its there i can adjust to it its no big thing
2755150 i really think people got to see how much of an addition desean can be this year
2755151 desean played better than a lot of people expected he had that little hamstring issue in camp and you never got to see that go route where he exploded on people but the catches he made over the middle and the patience he showed for his first nfl game you got to be excited that guy is going to be used in a lot of different ways

2755191 f r a da aprecieri con inutului comunicatului de pres al ambasadei rom niei serviciul de pres al pre edintelui republicii moldova declar oficial c n republica moldova nu exist nici un fel de televiziune preziden ial consider m c ambasada rom niei ar trebui s de in informa ii mai exacte despre ara n care este acreditat n caz contrar apar situa ii c nd comunicatele de genul celui difuzat de ambasada rom niei n ultima instan se dovedesc a fi o adev rat provoca ie
2755192 ambasada rom niei n republica moldova a luat act cu preocupare i consternare de solicitarea postului de televiziune nit tv prin care misiunii rom niei la chi in u i se adreseaz o serie de ntreb ri speculative ostentative i provocatoare potrivit unor interese i ra iuni care nu au nimic n comun cu dorin a p r ii rom ne de a dezvolta n cel mai nalt grad rela iile cu republica moldova
2755193 subliniem surprinderea n legatur cu formul rile i limbajul agresive folosite n solicitarea nit tv care sunt caracteristice unor rechizitorii i mai pu in unei adres ri oficiale i protocolare n aten ia unei ambasade a unui stat membru al uniunii europene
2755194 solicitarea nit tv contravine n mod flagrant normelor regulilor i codului de maniere care guverneaz rela iile dintre o institu ie de pres i o misiune diplomatic n acest sens ambasada rom niei la chi in u i exprim preocuparea asupra gestului nregistrarii audio i video a momentului depunerii cererii de interviu situa ie care dep e te i ncalc n mod evident cadrul conven iei de la viena privind statutul misiunilor diplomatice i consulare potrivit c reia acestea trebuie s i desf oare activitatea n statul de re edint n afara oric ror presiuni
2755195 i rezerv dreptul de a ignora orice alte solicit ri din partea nit tv sau a oric ror altor institu ii media autohtone care sunt angajate n atacarea i denigrarea constant a rom niei autori ilor rom ne i ambasadei rom niei la chi in u
2755196 n vederea abord rii subiectului viz nd declara iile ambasadorului rom n f cute n cadrul conferin ei de pres din 28 noiembrie 2007 potrivit c rora acesta aduce nvinuiri p r ii moldovene ti referitor la tergiversarea procesului de finalizare a negocierilor i semn rii tratatului ntre republica moldova i rom nia de parteneriat i cooperare i a tratatului ntre republica moldova i rom nia privind frontiera de stat regimul frontierei de stat colaborarea i asisten a mutual n problemele de frontier
2755197 ambasadorului rom niei i s a atras aten ia asupra comentariilor f cute referitor la revizuirea prevederilor tratatului de pace ntre puterile aliate i asociate cu rom nia semnat la paris la 10 februarie 1947 precizeaz comunicatul maeie de la chi in u
2755198 potrivit conven iei de la viena din 1969 cu privire la dreptul tratatelor i conven iei onu din 23 august 1978 privind succesiunea statelor la tratate tratatele care stabilesc frontierele ntre state poart un caracter nelimitat n timp i nici una din p r i n mod unilateral nu este n drept s revizuiasc prevederile lor
2755199 pornind de la aceste premise partea moldoveneasc este n a teptarea explica iilor oficiale ale p r ii rom ne vis a vis de cele declarate de ambasadorul rom niei la chi in u
2755200 un document complet nou care punea n eviden faptul c oferta rom niei de a semna acordul parafat n anul 2000 a primit un raspuns negativ
2755201 n aceste condi ii procesul de dialog a fost reluat i n momentul de fa se discut despre ncheierea unui acord european de parteneriat i cooperare un acord care din punctul nostru de vedere nu are nici un fel de probleme s l putem semna
2755202 rom nia este dispus s dezvolte cele mai nalte rela ii cu republica moldova i nu avem nici un fel de rezerv ca s convenim un document care s sublinieze i s confirme o asemenea pozi ie politic
2755203 exist o singur problem legat de faptul c partea moldovean solicit introducerea n acest acord a unei referiri la tratatul de la paris din 1947 document care spune cu referire la frontiera dintre rom nia i uniunea sovietic grani a dintre rom nia i urss este grani a care a fost convenit ntre rom nia i urss n 1940 pentru toat lumea este ns clar c n 1940 i p n n 1947 rom nia nu a ncheiat niciun fel de acord cu urss n leg tur cu o asemenea grani deci e un fals istoric i dac atunci a fost acceptat este pentru c rom nia era un stat nvins i ocupat i f r posibilitatea de a i ap ra interesele sale suverane
2755204 este evident c n anul 2007 acceptarea aceluia i fals istoric care s a f cut n 1947 ar fi cu totul de neconceput

2755213 well officially there is no glass but nobody cares people bring entire cases of beer
2755214 non credevo sarebbe sceso a tanto dopo le recenti gaffe di altri esponenti del governo lennesima caduta di stile di un membro di questo esecutivo
2755215 lidea di legare un dramma cos grande a tabelle e statistiche da castelli usate in modo pretestuoso e distorto mi fa rabbrividire il problema non questa o quella cifra il problema che si parla di persone che siano cento o mille che muoiano in un altoforno o sulla strada che sono costrette a percorrere per andare a guadagnare il pane
2755216 nessun altro paese europee ha statistiche complete e dettagliate come le nostre i dati sono esposti chiaramente dallinail non possibile equivocare a meno che non si voglia farlo i morti in itinere nel tragitto da casa al lavoro e viceversa sono intorno al 20 25 per cento castelli credo che consideri sbagliando il numero complessivo dei lavoratori deceduti in incidenti stradali ma in questa voce c anche chi perde la vita in servizio perch fa il camionista o il fattorino guida il bus conduce un taxi lui allora in malafede un paese con quattro morti di lavoro al giorno come il nostro ha lacune gravissime anche un solo morto sarebbe troppo riflettiamo su questo e diamoci da fare polemizzare come castelli non porta a niente lobbiettivo comune dovrebbe essere lo stesso ridurre gli infortuni azzerare i decessi

2755218 we know that the clubs are talking about the transfer although they have not reached a conclusion yet
2755219 i think an august transfer is still a possibility though kaka will only talk about that when they do a deal
2755220 he is waiting for a deal and then he will start to negotiate with chelsea
2755221 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work
2755222 he was always such a little man this was finally something that made him feel big
2755223 we dont speculate on what the reserve bank might do about interest rates
2755224 but if interest rates were to fall then we would expect the banks to pass that on to mortgage holders
2755225 lets give people the chance to move their bank accounts if theyre not satisfied with the service theyre getting
2755226 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with macs wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are missed
2755227 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2755228 wherever i am i have to play i have to put on a good show
2755229 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy life a little bit i missed a lot of things you know
2755230 slept with too many women done too many drugs and been to too many parties
2755231 george has been giving him advice on things such as presentation public speaking and body language he also emails him constantly about policy especially the middle east

2755237 dentro de poco seremos pioneros en cuesti n musical nos falta un poco a n nos falta llegar a todos los estamentos de la sociedad pero se han hecho auditorios estupendos somos la admiraci n de todo el mundo se han creado orquestas muy buenas teatros de pera en fin yo creo que somos un ejemplo
2755238 debemos espabilarnos y trabajar porque yo veo c mo trabajan estos chicos y menos de diez horas diarias no tocan el piano
2755239 pues cada vez la comprenden mejor la han tocado en la final y en las semifinales y han hecho una m sica impresionante
2755240 los europeos no tienen paciencia para este instrumento quieren resultados inmediatos
2755241 la misma alicia de larrocha estaba presente y dijo que le faltaba todav a si se les lanza a tocar a los sitios donde el concurso les presenta como el carnegie hall de nueva york wigmore hall de londres y tantas otras salas de concierto sin estar preparados es contraproducente para ellos
2755242 yo creo que va muy bien est muy bien llevado siempre caben mejoras efectivamente pero creo que est muy bien
2755243 ser a estupendo tener una orquesta pero de gran calidad para tener una orquesta mediocre mejor invitar a otras y hacer una orquesta es muy caro pero creo que cerca de nuestra comunidad tenemos orquestas muy buenas con las que se podr a llegar a un acuerdo y hacer ciclos con ellas
2755244 ive been working on trying to stay short on my swing and not try to do too much and the patience and practice paid off
2755245 i never hit more than two homers in a game and after the third one the guys were starting to get on me a bit
2755246 i dont want to be a woman i dont want to look good for men i fear and distrust men i want male prerogatives
2755247 the only real elegance is in the mind if youve got that the rest really comes from it

2755250 es ist unser job den gesamten infrastrukturmarkt in nordeuropa aufmerksam zu beobachten
2755251 es liegt in der nachbarschaft zu unserem netz und hat einige anbindungen
2755252 es wurde pl tzlich immer rutschiger und ich bin leider gest rzt ber das vorderrad dann wurde zum gl ck f r mich abgebrochen und ich konnte beim zweiten rennen noch mal mitfahren anfangs war ich schon drei sekunden hinter joey und bin nur schwer ins rennen gekommen aber dann hatte ich ein immer besseres gef hl und kam wieder heran konnte joey sogar noch mal berholen zuletzt habe ich noch einen fehler gemacht und bin dann als dritter ins ziel gekommen joeys rger kann ich verstehen ich habe bei der zieldurchfahrt selbst nicht gewusst dass ich gewonnen habe
2755253 anyway as i was saying to the miniscule rootley farnham and it
2755254 the dunk master can shove his dunking chair right up his arse i mean think about it its not even logical surely dunking my puny body into the stinky waters of lake effluence with its multitude of diseases shit and hamster eating pike cannot possibly prove that i am anything but an average hamster who firmly believes in the teachings of the wheel its so obvious that even a blithering moron could see it and anyone who thinks it isnt and can mount a reasonable counter argument can go stick their privates in the mangle sideways
2755255 and eloquent too but it will do you no good boy for if the fishy wishies dont eat you and your lungs do not give up their air too freely it will only condemn you then youll hang from the gallows for a week where the midges can feast gleefully upon your soft tissues
2755256 its not like youre all surprised or anything everyone knows that weasels pit has a well trained toad as its dunk master and an ugly bastard one at that
2755257 into the dunking chair accused scum quickly or ill wrap my enormous tongue about your nether regions and crush you to a pulp
2755258 do your worst loathsome beast youll not better me i curse the wheel
2755259 young farnham is a witch after all es gone and made imself all eavy sos e can sink to the bottom and evade the justice of the wheel by wallowin in the ooze
2755260 the word is warlock and would you please refrain from dropping your aitches but i take your point drowning is an excellent means to save yourself from the gallows but itll do him no good whatsoever justice will prevail ill see to that
2755261 he might ave turned imself into a pike sos e can swim away and thumb is nose at us at a later date and probably from quite some distance too
2755262 i do believe we are witnessing a primitive form of law enforcement for surely it is not justice that we see practiced here
2755263 but should we sit and fret why aint ya doing something about it
2755264 do you really think so it would be ever so daring wouldnt it but might we not risk some dreadful wounding from the lawmens crossbows
2755265 but underneath all this flappy finery theres a chain mail blanket even this female equivalent of a codpiece that im wearing is armoured aint nothing gonna hurt me 24 unless i take a bolt straight up the jacksey and what are the chances of that
2755266 i had that codpiece especially made for you i call it a minge piece it fits perfectly
2755267 yes and i shall wear the armour of righteousness to protect me come dear gallant margarita the bravest female cavy in all of spanx we gallop toward our destiny
2755268 we waddle with all this crap on my back the only way im gonna build up any speed is by jumping off a cliff i dont see one any place nearby so we waddle toward our destiny
2755269 what you doin with young rootley farnham do you intend to ave your wicked way with im in one of the back room of the stoat and wanger im not bein conscious too its unforgivable you scarlet 27 hussy you now put im down this instant

2755324 theyre still going to fight theyre still going to fight for years to come
2755325 theyve still got cockfighting in every state they just hide it from the law

2755330 investors welcomed the drop in crude prices and the rise of the us stock market on friday this would give confidence to investors
2755331 the fundamentals are strong and there is already clear skies ahead given the continued slide in crude prices which hopefully would put less pressure on prices and interest rates
2755332 there is already a slow reversal in trend although we are not out of the woods yet
2755333 although the lag effect of the reduction in crude prices is yet to be felt globally fund managers are starting to welcome the trend as good reprieve in arresting future decline in consumer and investment spending growth
2755334 it will still be a question of whether the market will be able to sustain its rise at this point the value turnover seemed not cooperating in order to confirm that equities are already positioned for recovery
2755335 optimism about the future economy is based on a question about the economy in general and not about oneself in particular it is normal to be more optimistic about ones own quality of life than about the economy as a whole
2755336 no person except those in oil producing countries would say that they are in a better position right now this is due to the global food and energy crisis what is important is that the government is addressing the situation and is helping the poor cope with it

2755338 people have seen weekly increases in the price of oil add to that the opening of classes in june which required expenditures and the typhoons which also hiked the prices of commodities the public was really hit
2755339 the police will be the lead agency in securing a credible and peaceful election and the military will provide them full support

2755374 no doubt about it 2006 was the worst year for republicans since watergate
2755375 from what im hearing from new democrats the republican party no longer represents their values
2755376 they see light at the end of the tunnel after eight years of bush
2755377 two years ago for various reasons there certainly was almost a national stampede to vote against gop candidates of any office
2755378 today people are much more looking at individual races and candidates
2755379 this wont be a referendum on party or incumbent its going to be candidate driven
2755380 if you run the right candidates and adhere to the principles of low taxes and fiscal responsibility the voters will stay with you

2755390 it comes from africa and it arrives in the swiss banks thats all you need to know
2755391 there is a desire to deal with this but the question is how
2755392 home depot can track every 2 by 4 to its forest of origin
2755393 you can track every bag of coffee every diamond to a specific diamond field but for gold theres nothing
2755394 if i have one wish its that i might someday have a little bit of money
2755395 sometimes i dream that one day ill own something made of gold

2755397 it is fair to suggest the gx 20 is not an entry level unit it has clearly been designed with the intermediate to advanced user in mind who is familiar with the general controlling functions and handling of a dslr
2755398 samsung has gotten its formula almost right with the gx 20 however one factor that puts the korean company at a disadvantage is the sparse number of lenses and accessories available compared with other manufacturers but its clearly not slowing down promising to announce the successor to the gx 20 and six more optics at photokina in germany later this year
2755399 with the launch of the gx 20 digital slr samsung has a full digital camera line up ranging from convergent compact digital cameras through to high end fully featured digital slrs

2755519 the happenings in two regions of jammu and kashmir on the amarnath land issue is the handiwork of isi and some separatists in kashmir
2755520 kashmir has always been physically a part of india and the religious freedom being enjoyed by kashmiris is not there even in pakistan and some other islamic countries
2755521 every indian has the right on every inch of land
2755522 they say how can you give land to outsiders in kashmir jammu and kashmir is an integral part of india and whoever raises questions about this issue will have to pay for it
2755523 this is not a question of amarnath only or of a shrine they are saying it is okay that you have alloted land for vaishno devi in jammu but how can you allot land in kashmir
2755524 and if somebody tries to resist that means he or she is challenging the constitutional fact that jammu and kashmir is an integral part of india therefore we will oppose their move with all our might and we will win

2755570 if you dont find the time to write something somebody is able to understand
2755571 we are looking to have good partnership in the morning i hope laxman and dravid play what they played in kolkata in 2001 and put us in a good situation and from there if we win the game it will be a great win for indian cricket
2755572 we are not out of the match there is still a big hope on laxman and rahul they are very capable of getting 100s and and my hope keeping my fingers crossed both of them get a brilliant hundred on monday and we have some sort of target to defend them let us see
2755573 obviously it is a little disappointment that as a batting unit we did not perform what we should actually have these are the guys who have won games for india it is just a matter of not clicking perhaps
2755574 it would obviously have been good if the openers had contributed it is good to get a strong start but now that it has not happened we cannot do anything about it we have to play well and make sure we get maximum runs and they try to make a game out of it
2755575 i think they have been in lot of pain it is great the way they have come out to bat they felt it was important from the teams point of view that they should bat hats off to them
2755576 it is important to have your four bowlers fit when you are playing a test match losing ishant in the middle of the game was a set back i think there were only three bowlers when we were bowling trying to get wickets on this flat wicket
2755577 ishant is little better than what he was and i hope he gets better and he bowl in the second innings
2755578 to be very honest i did not check the referral system but whatever it is it is good for the game i believe it is very fair
2755579 i wish i could pick his luck the wicket taking luck we all bowl the same sort of delivery obviously he is new in international cricket the more the people play him the more they will get to see him
2755580 more people will learn about him obviously he got some variation and every ball have variations basically i would like to steal his luck wicket taking luck
2755581 whatever we get more than 150 runs lead we will try and make the game out of it but we have to bat really well tomorrow to get those runs since laxman and rahul are still there there is a big hope
2755582 the pitch is a very good wicket to bat on i think if you have patience you can score lot of runs obviously it is not doing much for the bowlers for the spinners or seamers it is not spinning big or bouncing much it is a good wicket to bat on and i hope we bat well tomorrow
2755583 it is pretty much the same it is quite a hard surface may be on the fifth day it will play differently you have to bat well to go to the fifth day i am keeping my fingers crossed hoping to get some sort of runs on board to bowl at sri lankans in the second innings try to make a match out of it

2755587 it should be underlined that he loves juventus and would have no doubts in naming them as his dream team for the present and the future
2755588 i always remind him how grateful he should be that destiny saw him grow up in the juve youth system the club should keep a tight grip on him
2755589 he is a player who gives his best in the final third
2755590 but at empoli i saw he was also used with success as a wide left midfielder when he returns we will discuss it and see what he can do

2755645 executive privilege claims that form the foundation of the executives resistance to the committees subpoenas are not foreign to federal courts either
2755646 marbury v madison 1803 i t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is through united states v nixon 1974 the judiciary is the ultimate arbiter of claims of executive privilege to boumediene v bush 200
2755647 in the thirty four years since united states v nixon was decided the courts have routinely considered questions of executive privilege or immunity
2755648 is not merely an investigation into the executives use of his removal power but rather a broader inquiry into whether improper partisan considerations have influenced prosecutorial discretion
2755649 defies both reason and precedent to say as the executive does that the committee which is charged with oversight of doj generally cannot permissibly employ its investigative resources on this subject
2755650 unique ability to address improper partisan influence in the prosecutorial process n o other institution will fill the vacuum if congress is unable to investigate and respond to this evil
2755651 the 110th congress expires on january 3 2009 unlike the senate the house is not a continuing body
2755652 on the committees side the entire house and thus any outstanding subpoenas will lapse on january 3 2009 and the basis of this lawsuit will cease to exist to be sure the incoming house of representatives may elect to re issue similar subpoenas but that remains speculative at this juncture similarly the incoming executive administration may decline to pursue the assertions of immunity and executive privilege that form the foundation of this dispute
2755653 a former president may still assert executive privilege but the claim necessarily has less force particularly when the sitting president does not support the claim of privilege
2755654 as with the incoming congress there is no way to predict whether the new administration will support the assertions of privilege made in this case there is also the likelihood of appeal of this decision and given the significance of the issues involved a stay pending appeal is at least possible thus although proceedings before this court could be concluded prior to january 2009 any appeals process may not run its course before that date at that point the case would arguably become moot nevertheless the court concludes that this concern does not counsel against entertaining this case
2755655 lets get all this behind us so that the congress will not be fooling around with bush once the new president arrives

2755665 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2755666 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2755667 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2755668 ya justru karena tempat umum makanya jangan seenaknya ngerokok dan asapnya mengganggu orang gitu dong
2755669 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2755670 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2755671 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2755672 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2755673 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2755674 there is an obvious israeli involvement in the present conflict between georgia and russia
2755675 melman wrote on 25 6 2008 that georgia became a real el dorado for israeli arms dealers and numerous representatives of the army and intelligence services some former generals like israel ziv and gal hirsh with his company defensive shield are very active there
2755676 gal hirsh and israel ziv are mainly training and consulting georgian arm units they are using the chain method common among israeli arm dealers a main contractor wins a tender and employs then sub contractors in this case israeli officers and former shin beth employees
2755677 to every israeli agent representing an israeli defense company is attached a cousin of the defense minister who opens the doors for him
2755678 the israeli military industries upgraded in recent years the georgian air force sold unmanned aerial vehicles uav advanced artillery systems and trained infantry units
2755679 in addition to the trainers 1 000 soldiers from the vicenza italy based southern european task force airborne and the kaiserslautern based 21st theater sustainment command along with marine reservists with the 3rd battalion 25th marines out of ohio and the state of georgia s army national guard s 1st battalion 121st infantry participated in immediate response 2008
2755680 operation immediate response 2008 was held from july 15 july 30 with u s personnel training about 600 troops at a former soviet base near tbilisi the largest city and capital of georgia the goal of this operation was allegedly teaching combat skills for missions in iraq
2755681 it is obvious that there are numerous israeli and u s interests in georgia and it is highly likely that they are behind the dangerous georgian move

2755726 if god created everything then god created evil since evil exists and according to the principal that our works define who we are then god is evil
2755727 what kind of question is this of course it exists have you never been cold
2755728 once again you are wrong sir darkness does not exist either darkness is in reality the absence of light we can study light but not darkness in fact we can use newtons prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wave lengths of each color you cannot measure darkness a simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it how can you know how dark a certain space is you measure the amount of light present isnt this correct darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present
2755729 of course as i have already said we see it everyday it is in the daily example of mans inhumanity to man it is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world these man ifestations are nothing else but evil
2755730 evil does not exist sir or at least it does not exist unto itself evil is simply the absence of god it is just like darkness and cold a word that man has created to describe the absence of god god did not create evil evil is not like faith or love that exist just as does light and heat evil is the result of what happens when man does not have gods love present in his heart its like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light

2755747 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2755748 is when there is pressure he takes it off himself he doesnt rely on the external factors to take the pressure off he does it internally
2755749 i think thats whats different about him i think he recognizes pressure but he has developed a routine over the years where i think physiologically and psychologically he is able to block it out and get in a state where he is ready to perform i think he almost sees pressure as a signal it gets him going

2755757 are democrats really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling
2755758 i think the american people would find that a suicidal strategy
2755759 so republicans are going to tell seniors youre being squeezed by high gas prices and high grocery prices and now were going to cut off your social security checks
2755760 said jennifer crider a spokeswoman for the democratic congressional campaign committee the house democrats campaign arm
2755761 as far as im concerned those bans end sept 30 and if they end on sept 30 fuel prices will head back down on oct 1
2755762 i want to see the most forward looking energy policy for alternatives
2755763 if in order to get that you have to compromise and have the states sign off on whether they want drilling or not maybe thats the price we are going to pay to get it but to have an up or down vote on drilling where does that leave us it leaves us in the same place republicans have put us in after eight years of their policies

2755871 the culture the custom of the cajun people its gone
2755872 its another one of the rights that big government has taken away from the people
2755873 theyre still going to fight theyre still going to fight for years to come
2755874 theyve still got cockfighting in every state they just hide it from the law
2755875 cockfighting may still be going on with much smaller venues in the back woods but my understanding is there hasnt been any big activity since the gambling ban
2755876 a lot of people are going to quit theyre just going to shut down
2755877 were losing out on an opportunity to keep our heritage and our culture

2755883 if we can stop the signal for the proliferation of uncontrolled growth of the cells then we can stop the leukaemia in its tracks
2755884 if scientists found a cure or something that could help not to have his puffer every day that would be great
2755885 why do you exercise eh cos you want to live longer wanker
2755886 until i stayed with her i never knew you could conjugate the c word in the present participle
2755887 i know people who have been caught and deported but most are never caught
2755888 to turn yourself in so you can go home and live in a village with no work if i wanted to do that i would have stayed in my village i wouldnt have risked my life to come here in the first place
2755889 for them its getting too hard to hide they have the stress of looking over their shoulders
2755890 they know theres a lot of law enforcement looking for them this is their way to go home
2755891 for anyone to say no one will do it thats absolutely wrong
2755892 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
2755893 they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
2755894 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
2755895 what she will treasure the most is the fact that she was his wife for 30 years and not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly
2755896 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
2755897 he was critically ill when he was in the hospital
2755898 there were no signs of a struggle or foul play inside or around the residence
2755899 he was pretty lonely he was just out there looking for some friends its just unfortunate
2755900 i thought people would be honest enough to see me as a person who was trying to do something good and not as a celebrity
2755901 my mother always taught me say something good or say nothing at all
2755902 figment of the tabloid press i dont want that garbage in with the puppy story
2755903 that i would ski naked down mount everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
2755904 we go to church and serve the lord and try to lead good lives and do good things
2755905 she is a person of note in our little community
2755906 we dont intend to take the initiative to escalate the conflict at this time
2755907 over the past few years i lived in a democratic country and i was happy now america and the european union spit on us
2755908 want to use the platform of the olympics to amplify the effects
2755909 if the world were to draw any lessons from what i did there would never be any wars
2755910 when you discuss security issues if you are telling the truth that should be something protected at the core of the first amendment
2755911 if you are truthfully telling the world about a dangerous situation and it is a situation which is dangerous not because the security researcher exposes the vulnerability but because the person who made the product made the vulnerability then this should be core speech
2755912 knowingly causes the transmission of a program information code or command to a computer or computer system
2755913 the statute on its face appears to be discussing sending code or similar types of information to a computer
2755914 it does not appear to contemplate somebody who is giving a talk to humans nevertheless the court believed that the act of giving a presentation to a group of humans was covered by the computer fraud computer intrusion statute we believe this is wrong
2755915 basically what the court is suggesting here is that giving a presentation involving security to other security researchers is a violation of federal law
2755916 as far as i know this is completely unprecedented and it has a tremendous chilling effect on sharing this sort of research and we intend to fight it with everything weve got
2755917 we didnt find that to be a very pleasing way to start a nice dialogue with them
2755918 and at that point we declined to provide the slides until we had an opportunity to see what the complaint said
2755919 please understand that rhetoric aside the intention was to provide an interesting and useful talk but not one that would enable people to defraud the massachusetts bay transit system
2755920 may not wear a hat or remain by the clerks desk during the call of the roll or the counting of ballots
2755921 a person may not smoke or use a wireless telephone or personal computer on the floor of the house
2755922 if he cant solve a problem one way he stays on it like a bulldog until he finds another way
2755923 he knows how to craft an issue and deliver the message
2755924 culberson has generated a story line that distinguishes him from the crowd
2755925 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties
2755926 you need some help getting it out to the car maam
2755927 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2755928 it was most likely an indirect link to the olympic team the attack must have been an isolated incident
2755929 i believe that weve felt very safe and havent felt threatened at all
2755930 but we wont be hunkering down in our hotel room
2755931 fuck you i like this shit and you dont have to
2755932 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on cease fire and termination of hostilities

2755937 we are investigating that it may be tied to several other bank robberies some of which that occurred in this county one of which that occurred in an adjacent county
2755938 if im not mistaken i think that the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2755939 us group of guys in the prelims the b relay if you will we knew we had a good chance of getting the world record
2755940 obviously its going to be broken tomorrow morning its nice to have a world record for a night
2755941 were all fighting for a spot in the final but were a team
2755942 we wanted to make sure we qualified we do our job first and get the world record second one of us gets the honor of swimming in the final we know both the french and the u s are going to have different teams
2755943 i have my work cut out for me in the 100 back
2755944 theres a lot of pressure on me im going to try to enjoy it as much as possible im not surprised the 100 back has been the biggest progressing event in my opinion i expected that
2755945 the biggest thing is having a good race tomorrow morning being recovered enough to come back
2755946 is when there is pressure he takes it off himself he doesnt rely on the external factors to take the pressure off he does it internally
2755947 i think thats whats different about him i think he recognizes pressure but he has developed a routine over the years where i think physiologically and psychologically he is able to block it out and get in a state where he is ready to perform i think he almost sees pressure as a signal it gets him going
2755948 im really really not a morning person if i have a workout at 7 30 im hitting the snooze button at 6 50
2755949 i think the only one whos not intimidated is ryan
2755950 what do i have to do to beat this man

2755957 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude and i want america to know im like totally ready to lead
2755958 hes the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket but is he ready to lead
2755959 instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference
2755960 we have been working hard and it will be fun to put the pads on and see what we can do in live action
2755961 camp is going well we need to stay focused and keep getting better every day
2755962 the scrimmage will help us as coaches make some decisions on personnel and positions
2755963 its a great teaching day because we will be able to better evaluate the players and get a better feel of the team weve only had one day of full pads and that was yesterday we have to be careful because guys are tired and we dont want to get anyone hurt

2756001 known perpetrators are not being arrested let alone prosecuted police are being thwarted by those in charge of the prosecution
2756002 i can quite clearly say that the investigation is being held up there are people on the island who just dont want us going down the route of this inquiry
2756003 if the test results on the final samples are no more accurate then the answer is that something very nasty happened in there we dont know exactly what and because we cant prove who or what it was there is no possibility of a successful homicide investigation
2756004 we have had problems dating the bones but instead of people saying how unfortunate it is that the science cant be of more help to us the politicians are saying this is a waste of time the fact that were trying to bring people to justice for awful abuse is ignored and its just a constant day by day attack on the inquiry and on the victims
2756005 one file has been with the attorney generals office since april 29 and its still showing no signs of moving at the moment its been very frustrating
2756006 i dont think they are involved in child abuse its more like an old boy network
2756007 the ordinary people of jersey are overwhelmingly in favour of the inquiry but how many expressions of support and sympathy for the victims have we heard from the politicians none they dont do sympathy for the victims
2756008 they had been taken from one part of the building to another and put on top of the hard compact undisturbed original floor of the cellars they had been spread about and covered with a thin layer of topsoil why would someone do that unless there was a deliberate attempt to conceal them
2756009 people might say these killings must have happened in the 60s but there may have been someone who had been working there for 30 or 40 years who knew that something had happened but even then it might not have been a homicide it could have been that children died of natural causes accidents or suicide we just dont know
2756010 we have procedures in place that are as ironclad as you can do

2756025 la verdad es que espa a tiene un comportamiento muy polideportivo la prueba se ve en que hemos sacado muchas medallas en campeonatos del mundo en diferentes deportes y aqu en los juegos ol mpicos por ahora las cosas van a ese nivel
2756026 una persona que se lo merece much simo como es pirri abajo
2756027 ojal sigamos en ese papel de referente polideportivo y sigamos poco a poco todo lo que se pueda sumar
2756028 muy contento sobre todo por el sentimiento colectivo que tiene la selecci n espa ola ol mpica que es una selecci n aut ntica es un conjunto de gente como nadal que va a ver el baloncesto o que vibran con el triunfo de unos y otros y la verdad por ahora en pek n me quedo con el ambiente colectivo que hay me parece maravilloso
2756029 esto son los imponderables pero vamos poquito a poco cumpliendo las expectativas que es lo m s importante
2756030 los futbolistas tuvieron hoy una tarde feliz con buen juego y m s velocidad que ante b lgica y sin dejar jugar al rival
2756031 es normal que vayamos progresando porque nos presentamos en pek n con s lo quince d as de trabajo conjunto y muchos jugadores est n a n en pretemporada
2756032 jugaremos a ganar porque s lo sabemos hacerlo de esa manera adem s brasil siempre debe salir a vencer y a jugar bien
2756033 brasil s lo est pensando en una cosa vencer los juegos ol mpicos
2756034 hoy jugamos bien especialmente durante los ltimos minutos por eso tuvimos las oportunidades de mostrar incluso buenas individualidades trabajamos como equipo mantuvimos bien la posesi n y jugamos buena parte del partido en su campo
2756035 quiz no jugamos como lo pensamos el rival se met a bien atr s jugaba bien al contragolpe y son cositas que tenemos que solucionar de a poco cositas como no ser tan predecibles estar bien ordenados en el fondo
2756036 seguramente no es lo mismo jugar en terreno seco que en mojado pero no influy tanto la lluvia
2756037 tenemos que hacer algo con nuestra defensa para que sea m s fuerte y mejor
2756038 tuve una cooperaci n muy buena con di mar a y en realidad yo s lo recib el pase y la empuj di mar a me la pas muy bien
2756039 todav a cometemos algunos fallos pero estamos creciendo como equipo
2756040 estamos contentos con la victoria aunque perdimos muchas oportunidades en la ltima media hora
2756041 creo que tuvimos 14 15 oportunidades de gol necesitamos mejorar delante de la red
2756042 ha sido un partido dif cil y estamos felices de ganar ahora tenemos que prepararnos para los cuartos
2756043 jugadores que pueden estar peleados con la pelota pero que en cualquier momento te pueden resolver el partido
2756044 igual de duros con su manera t ctica de jugarle a la argentina que con creo que con los dem s equipos jueguen de la misma manera
2756045 ho pensato che se proprio devo andare allinferno tanto vale andarci in grande stile
2756046 la t nica de esta campa a estaba lista desde hace meses y contin a no hay ning n plan de cambiarla
2756047 en agosto de 2016 cuando los juegos ser n celebrados en madrid no tendremos que implementar ninguna medida especial para garantizar un sistema de transportaci n o temperatura adecuada para las competencias nuestros niveles de contaminaci n est n muy por debajo de la norma europea
2756048 despu s de estas olimpiadas chinas y de las anglosajonas en londres la mejor manera de internacionalizar el movimiento ol mpico ser an con unos juegos latinos en madrid
2756049 hemos conversado con el t cnico muricy ramalho y decidimos que lo mejor es que me reserve para jugar el pr ximo fin de semana ante el gremio
2756050 hemos optado por darle espacio a los chicos para que adquieran experiencia y la copa suramericana ser la oportunidad que muchos de ellos esperan para mostrar su talento
2756051 ecc quindi modera i termini che anche qui nel forum la usiamo o almeno io la uso ovviamente non la metto in ogni parola che scrivo ma spesso la uso
2756052 and whoever the next candidate is whether its john mccain or barack obama the next president is i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury
2756053 but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2756054 im going to do everything i can to step up to any problems that are going to face the country but again i look forward to doing other things you know next year
2756055 i believe it is going to take us well beyond the end of the year to work through all of the housing problems
2756056 well we have no plans to insert money in either of those institutions
2756057 i think it was very important that we get these temporary backup facilities because fannie and freddie are important to our capital markets broadly
2756058 as of today most of the city tskhinvali is controlled by russian peacekeeping forces
2756059 we deplore the dangerous and disproportionate actions by russian forces and we would be particularly troubled if these attacks are continuing now as the georgians are pulling back
2756060 the georgian tanks fired at everything they saw including women and children
2756061 its so difficult to be here and know my husband is still in south ossetia
2756062 we are not going to undertake any actions which are going to lead to escalation of the situation in this region
2756063 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
2756064 this is yet another nightmare capability project weve inherited from the previous government mr fitzgibbon told fairfax today
2756065 and this time were not talking about a complex project like a seasprite helicopter every army around the world operates trucks
2756066 to help his mate the hunter based shadow minister for defence science and personnel bob baldwin brendan nelson rushed to the hunter valley firm varley to announce the company and others like it would be beneficiaries of the overlander project he said
2756067 sir i dont want to see your fucking bill if you dont go back in your house and quit disrespecting me im going to just leave
2756068 when i look up the phone number on the account it only shows internet no cable television thats a red flag mam
2756069 okay well you are looking under my phone number and yes i only have internet service in my name seeing as i cancelled the phone and cable service my grandfather has a separate comcast account from me on which he only has extended cable if you would have let him show you the bill maybe you would have noticed it is two separate account numbers
2756070 mam i dont really care im doing my job and im not stupid comcast will not allow two different accounts at the same address so i already know you are blatantly lying to me
2756071 fuck you i like this shit and you dont have to
2756072 fuck you i like this shit and you dont have to
2756073 goh je bent zo verlegen en dromerig angstig geremd zenuwachtig of emotioneel onberekenbaar
2756074 fuck you i like this shit and you dont have to
2756075 fuck you i like this shit and you dont have to
2756076 it was thursday a quiet day in the cemetery so that the voice of the rabbi seemed to carry floating up to the branches of the trees where the finches watched with their button black eyes their beaks closing around the words as if prayers were as nourishing as thistle seed
2756077 7 the kilt song i tries to find a recording but
2756078 nilikua napinga wokovu na nilikuwa na tabia mbaya kiasi kwamba nilipotea nyumbani kwetu sikurudi nilirudi baada ya miaka kumi tayari nimeshaokoka na nimebadilika nyumbani hawakuamini walidhani nimeshakufa
2756079 it could be shares it could be on behalf of any juristic person this could be a company where they have tried to negotiate and failed
2756080 looks like a massive expansion of bee black economic empowerment
2756081 an issue all south africans need to elevate to number one on our list of priorities
2756082 we need to create an environment where investors can be confident of getting a return on investment without being expropriated
2756083 very bad time to start messing with land ownership and property
2756084 uses before elections to mobilise people on the basis of race to vote for the anc
2756085 there are people in the anc who are as appalled what we are seeing around expropriation is symptomatic of what we will be seeing in the years ahead what we are seeing is a government claiming to represent the will of the majority it is not in the interests of the majority it isnt the will of the majority we have a venal minority posing as a righteous majority using the race card
2756086 we invited people from their portfolio committee and relevant government departments i guess they are all busy on a monday afternoon
2756087 the fact they decided to postpone it might be a positive indication

2756089 it predates me being involved in politics or him being involved in politics im older than him so i serve an older brother role i hope he feels ive been there for him and hes certainly been a very loyal and terrifically helpful colleague
2756090 one of the roles ive always wound up playing is being a translator telling people yes he has a different approach hes serious about change this is what it means and my relationship with him gives credibility to that
2756091 my dad is one of the people who taught me how to laugh
2756092 the group had sort of a smothers brothers like routine they would sing songs and they would tell topical stories talk about current events tell a few jokes sing songs and you know thats my dads personality
2756093 i ended up delivering packages to these glittering buildings in downtown chicago and when youre a kid growing up in chicago these are the most important buildings in your life
2756094 in a permanent state of zen very even handed very mild mannered
2756095 when you meet him you feel like youve always known him
2756096 half the time hes coming in to give you bad news or ask you to do something youre not sure you want to do
2756097 but he walks down the hall hes got a smile on his face hes likable youre still happy to see him
2756098 he understands the importance of the personal touch and that e mails and phone calls are not always appropriate
2756099 there are times when a face to face is just the right thing to do he dropped everything and hopped on a plane
2756100 a program manager is first and foremost a leader in fact the program managers main leadership duty is to turn chaos into clarity for the team
2756101 there should be very few rules compared with the number of guidelines
2756102 my main task in writing the drawing book was to dig down underneath everything i knew about art and drawing to try to find the most fundamental level of thinking that goes on in drawing
2756103 you do this by knowing how your screenplay ends and then working backwards to find the opening for it
2756104 pick out your favorite book go to every tenth page and write down the first word on that page study your list of random words and see if any patterns come out
2756105 im also a devout believer that you have to identify exactly what that service is
2756106 imagine a long freight train moving down a railroad track as seen by two people from very different vantage points one person is standing on the ground about three feet from the track and is looking directly ahead of him at the train as it passes out of the corners of his eye he can glimpse that part of the train that has already passed as well as that part which will pass momentarily mostly what he sees is what is passing in front of him from moment to moment this is the way the left or logical side of the brain functions imagine now another person watching that same train at the same time this person is high up in the air perhaps in a balloon from her vantage point above the train she perceives it entirely differently from the person on the ground instead of seeing it one car at a time she sees it all at once this intuitive all at once holistic view is the way the right side of the brain functions
2756107 natuurlijk ik houd van scoren daarnaast was ik blij dat die strafcorner lukte we hebben er veel op getraind
2756108 bij het zuid afrikaanse heb ik me maar even omgedraaid en wat afleiding gezocht het wilhelmus heb ik uit volle borst meegezongen natuurlijk ben ik blij met deze zege we zijn hier om goud te winnen
2756109 its going to be like college again playing 36 in one day
2756110 it happens and everybody else is going to do it too so just have to go out there and deal with it
2756111 and theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course it needed the rain
2756112 yesterday i was very mad with my round 78 today i cant believe it i cant believe im here
2756113 i met a girl at sunset we made love like sea otters that was a pretty good day why couldnt i get that day over and over and over
2756114 how are our worship services going to get any better if we dont evaluate them
2756115 unlike larger towns barnard castle is not covered by cctv and that could be an attraction to that type of criminal
2756116 on the day of the last theft a blue mercedes was spotted acting suspiciously in the town
2756117 whether it is linked or not we dont know but what we would ask is that people be vigilant
2756118 theyre competing for an ever decreasing share of the household income expenditures
2756119 they do not have ultimate flexibility with regard to changing whatever it is that theyre doing
2756120 they can watch their cost side as much as they can keep their costs down so they can maintain their margins but the best medicine for the small business in central wisconsin would be for the overall economy to improve unfortunately they dont have a whole lot of control over that sort of thing
2756121 ocean beach activism is truly dead ob go went starbucks still here subway submarina wings all came im sure the next project the planning board will approve will be the gas station project where the garden used to be on voltaire well if greed doesnt win at first try keep trying until you run off the people in charge and you can get your
2756122 i would hate to see our teachers and classrooms lose out on money because the state doesnt have enough revenue
2756123 i understand why legislators want to give people a break because the economy is down and people are hurting and cant afford the things they want to buy
2756124 but they arent taking into account what that revenue could later buy for the states
2756125 weve given them the benefit of the doubt for a long time
2756126 a sales tax free weekend will be welcomed more than ever in this tough economy especially with the high prices of food and fuel
2756127 it is certainly worth it when you consider the positive impact on retail sales and consumer confidence
2756128 theres just something about a sales tax holiday thats different from a regular sale
2756129 there are a lot of families out there struggling to make ends meet and theyre having to stretch their dollars
2756130 while the 5 percent or so savings doesnt sound like a lot that could be a make or break
2756131 its the same sort of family that collects coupons for the grocery store that waits for tax holidays to shop
2756132 the sales tax holiday is really more of a political gimmick than good economic policy
2756133 the cfo pulled all his data and is using the mainframe instead of oracle
2756134 three bombs were dropped on a military airfield belonging to tbilaviastroi plant there were no casualties

2756139 as of today most of the city tskhinvali is controlled by russian peacekeeping forces
2756140 we deplore the dangerous and disproportionate actions by russian forces and we would be particularly troubled if these attacks are continuing now as the georgians are pulling back
2756141 the georgian tanks fired at everything they saw including women and children
2756142 its so difficult to be here and know my husband is still in south ossetia
2756143 we are not going to undertake any actions which are going to lead to escalation of the situation in this region
2756144 we just want to control our own small territory we dont want to cut it into parts
2756145 it feels as though we are occupied if it were any other country it would be called occupation and we dont take one step outside our own territory
2756146 we were trying to cover all options and we were hoping that exactly that would happen
2756147 we did a lead out on the hill on thursday the training day
2756148 i led them out then emma picked up the tempo sharon laws was on her wheel so we had already rehearsed that finish we knew the point at 200 metres to go where we wanted nicole to go we knew at what point the legs would be getting heavy
2756149 we wanted to make sure she laid off coming into the final corner but perhaps not that far
2756150 we were afraid someone might come down in front of her so we told her to keep to the left we knew she would chew them up after that
2756151 the plan was emma would go three kilometres from the turnstiles on the last lap
2756152 as soon as she came into the road she was to attack as hard as she could to put the germans on the defensive it worked emmas attack was fully committed
2756153 nicole could watch and wait because the other riders know what emma can do on her own so they were thinking would she ride away or was she bluffing we felt the germans were the most dangerous and they were put on the defensive one was using up all her energy chasing and trixi worrack their best rider was flapping
2756154 i thought yes we can stay away these girls want to catch guderzo so whatever happens well be going fast there was no decision it was just yes this is the time now
2756155 it was like a working group trying to find out the best case scenarios for getting me to the olympics
2756156 its a team effort but its not just the riders the staff and backup as well
2756157 i had tried the other route racing all season but got to major championships without full energy in the tank so why do the same thing if it had been proven not to work
2756158 but it was a high risk strategy because i was trying it for the first time i stuck to the plan and i believe in it
2756159 wir werden tats chlich erst kurz vor dem dritten wahlgang entscheiden was wir machen
2756160 meinen zweijahresvertrag sehe ich als anfang wenn der verein gl cklich ist mit der arbeit dann k nnen aus den zwei schnell mehrere jahre werden
2756161 wenn man sich j rgen klinsmann als trainer ausgedacht hat muss man seinen weg mitgehen wir werden seine philosophie mittragen und dazu sind wir bereit
2756162 ich erhoffe mir dass mein trainerstab und ich dass wir unsere handschrift kenntlich machen k nnen
2756163 und wir sind berzeugt dass dann auch titel kommen f r mich ist der fc bayern ein weiterf hrendes projekt eines ohne deadline
2756164 kalifornien ist f r meine familie immer noch die heimat wir haben dort ber zehn jahre gelebt und unser zuhause nach wie vor dort
2756165 die familie wird immer ein bisschen pendeln aber kalifornien ist bei uns sehr verwachsen
2756166 vom fc bayern werden erfolge erwartet bei allen neuerungen die jetzt eingef hrt werden
2756167 wir m ssen nicht jedes jahr deutscher meister werden aber wir wollen jedes jahr in die champions league
2756168 um hohe ziele zu erreichen braucht es schon die rib rys und tonis und die kosten geld
2756169 zu erwarten der fc bayern k nne in der k nigsklasse eine besondere rolle spielen wird immer unrealistischer
2756170 clubs die sechsmal mehr einnehmen als wir aus dem verkauf der tv rechte oder die eigent merstruktur in italien und england mit milliard ren wie berlusconi oder abramowitsch
2756171 wir leben in der liga eine extreme solidarit t manchmal habe ich den eindruck da ist zu viel bsirske und verdi und zu wenig winterkorn und vw

aussi alors que nous avions souhait concevoir un b timent r pondant aux normes hqe on nenvisage m me si on nest pas daccord avec le projet culturel de reconvertir le b timent alors oui pour moi cet acte de d molition est barbare la barbarie cest le contraire de la culture et de la civilisation et sattaquer ce qui est destin tre un lieu d di la lecture premier outil d mancipation et de conqu te est de cet ordre l de m me que casser le travail dun architecte homme de lart est contraire l thique je ne comprends pas votre d cision peut tre pr nez vous lesth tisme de la destruction la ruine du

une pens e toute particuli re pour les personnels municipaux qui se sont donn s sur ce dossier aucun ne m rite cela non le choix nest pas financier cest un faux probl me certes linvestissement pour r

les autres de ne surtout pas aider la municipalit de pierre albertini sur ce dossier cest un choix de politique culturelle et de politique de la ville un choix politique tout court mais surtout le

2756179 look at the prices of food around the world its unfair to look at just the price of oil as the leading indicator of where inflation trends may be
2756180 theres strong likelihood that the fed is going to have to start to raise interest rates to control inflation
2756181 for a long term investor id advocate slowly going back into commodities right now gold will be my favorite recommendation

2756202 since the idea of joint town meetings was scrapped the campaign has featured tough and often negative ads and speeches
2756203 the thought of him being president sends a cold chill down my spine
2756204 he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
2756205 i think the notion that somehow as a consequence of not having joint appearances senator mccain felt obliged to suggest that id rather lose a war to win a campaign doesnt automatically follow i think we each have control over ourselves and our campaigns and we have to take responsibility for that
2756206 well i wasnt going to accuse obama of wanting to lose a war and of being responsible for high gas prices but since there are only going to be three debates we might as well
2756207 in my opinion there are already elements of some of kind of genocide of the ossetian people
2756208 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy of their borders

2756212 in a negotiation it is a recipe for chaos to open talks to the public and refer each point agreed at the end of the day for public reaction negotiation is never done that way if you allow the public to breathe down your neck at the conference table and to snoop into your every point you will never get anywhere mature democracies debate settlements after a framework has been completed not before so it is nonsense to say that transparency includes giving the public access to the negotiating table
2756213 full public disclosure of all its transactions involving public interest

2756218 beh s sono contento ho realizzato davvero una rete bellissima si dice che nel calcio il treno passi solo una volta e destino ha voluto che proprio a frosinone ci fosse un osservatore della nazionale ma io devo stare tranquillo e tenere i piedi per terra so che a napoli potr fare ancora meglio e se riesco ad esprimermi bene nella mia squadra arriveranno poi cose importanti di conseguenza

2756221 in verit me ne avevano parlato molto ma davanti alla realt dei fatti sono rimasto stupito ed affascinato quando ho visto lo stadio nella gara col panionios sono rimasto a bocca aperta un colpo docchio incredibile uno spettacolo sensazionale ma io penso che sia anche la passione dei tifosi che faccia grande una squadra quando c questo amore e questa simbiosi tra i giocatori ed il pubblico nessun obiettivo diventa impossibile laffetto del popolo napoletano una componente che ci aiuter tantissimo

2756225 no doubt that the mood has darkened in the last two or three months
2756226 a year ago it seemed reasonable to hope that the worst would be over by now this has turned out not to be the case
2756227 the cbi along with most other forecasters has been consistently over optimistic about the economic outlook over the past 12 months
2756228 statt im kaukasus krieg zu f hren sollten bush und putin wo sie doch gerade hier sind lieber im shijie park miteinander k mpfen es gibt dort platz genug

2756238 it wasnt a fall or anything but it gave us a tiny disturbance at the last minute we had to reorganize things and readdress

2756243 i just love the shots ive been getting from my iphone camera you can bet it will affect how i paint things

2756246 organising something on the scale of the lambeth conference will inevitably result in a small deficit sometimes

2756264 if the merger does happen the closure orders for salford and eccles colleges would have to be formally issued by parliament which would further delay the setting up of the new college
2756265 the proposal is a big thing for salford and the government departments need to know what the benefits will be for 14 19 year old students and low skilled adults
2756266 whatever the outcome there will be no disruption to the students we will work with the colleges to determine the most appropriate time for a merger if it goes ahead but in the meantime any delay will not impact on the studying of students

2756279 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2756280 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2756281 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her

2756345 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2756346 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2756347 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2756348 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2756349 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2756350 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country

2756359 but the public prosecutor is investigating the papers violation of a news blackout on a case currently before the public prosecutor
2756360 dont realize what they are sharing is their entire hard drive
2756361 there are tens of thousands of individuals making a living doing this kind of work
2756362 theres a perspective that a number of the data breaches in recent years may have been related to this
2756363 but the fact that they got it from peer to peer is not always known
2756364 they got nailed from so many banks i have to believe whatever can be done they have done
2756365 this is yet another example of the power privileged identities such as administrative passwords have and the havoc they can cause in the wrong hands
2756366 hackers or rogue employees such as this case are savvier on how to create the most damage with the least effort these days and the use of admin passwords does just that unfortunately the san francisco department left themselves wide open by not taking their privileged identity management seriously
2756367 it is critical to take a more proactive approach to secure company back doors
2756368 companies install complex systems for personal passwords and overlook the more numerous privileged passwords and identities that provide even more system access these security breakdowns will continue to occur until these keys to the kingdom are securely centralized and managed

2756389 weve made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2756390 we deplore the dangerous and disproportionate actions by russian forces and we would be particularly troubled if these attacks are continuing now as the georgians are pulling back
2756391 very very concerned if in fact there is ground action inside of georgia proper that is outside of these areas of abkhazia and ossetia
2756392 both presidents have the same position and agree across the board but specifically on these three points that there needs to be a ceasefire there needs to be disengagement and there needs to be respect for georgian territorial integrity

2756402 when it comes to sport we will always remain friends and nothing will come between our friendship
2756403 if the world were to draw any lessons from what we do there wouldnt be any wars we live in the 21st century after all and we shouldnt stoop so low as to wage wars
2756404 i think its not a problem with sportsmen its politics
2756405 i dont think so at all i think its entirely up to senator edwards and his wife and the rest of us should keep quiet
2756406 the edwards family indicated they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2756407 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing

2756412 is an indicator of whether modern man can curb his appetite and preserve what nature has created

2756414 hearing the news was tragic stunning words cant describe it
2756415 how can i help thats all we were thinking we talked about how the best thing we could do was try to play volleyball
2756416 it meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys when we heard from him
2756417 he talked about trying to move on he just told us it will be difficult but together well be much stronger
2756418 we wanted to have a moment of silence where we could gather our thoughts before starting this journey
2756419 it was a moment of silence to honor the bachman family
2756420 the one thing weve always talked about is that this is about a team its not about individual people
2756421 the thing that came across as hugh was talking to us is you know what ive got this happening right now but we came here with a goal in mind and weve invested all this time in it and we need to go out there and try to complete what we started
2756422 it means going out there and playing better every match than we did the previous match
2756423 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2756424 maybe thats why it hurt so much it just felt so close
2756425 the best way we can honor them at this juncture is to go out and compete every day and play hard every day and enjoy and love the game of volleyball and it is a game
2756426 we should be playing it and enjoying it and loving it as they would
2756427 were totally aware that we may see him and we may not
2756428 thats completely all right with us he has other priorities

2756437 i can go up there on any given weekend and go to a rooster fight and its wide open like its not against the law
2756438 we need a program of psychosurgery and political control of our society
2756439 the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view
2756440 man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electrical stimulation of the brain
2756441 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor for that matter in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country

2756456 home depot can track every 2 by 4 to its forest of origin
2756457 you can track every bag of coffee every diamond to a specific diamond field but for gold theres nothing

2756482 mr robbins will be speaking about the challenges of new media and delivery systems
2756483 sure tim theres no question sex scandals race riots and drunken tv stars are a lot of fun but shouldnt broadcasters see themselves as part of the larger picture isnt there an obligation to honestly report on what is going on to pursue stories past their headlines havent criminal acts occurred in government shouldnt there be accountability for inept policy decisions shouldnt someone be fired
2756484 im just a businessman i provide what the audience wants
2756485 enough is enough now is the time to move away from our lesser selves now is the time to stop making money on the misfortunes of others and the prurient and salacious desires of the public now is the time to admit and recognize that we arent just businessmen but the guardians of the human spirit with a responsibility to the health of this nation that we can lift this country up with our programming that instead of catering to the gossips and the scolds and the voyeurs we can appeal to the better nature in our audience the better nature of what this country is all about

2756493 high fuel prices are doing the job the politicians refused to do
2756494 at 20mph 80 of the force acting to slow a bike down comes from air resistance
2756495 there should be no more than a 3 percent penalty in fuel economy
2756496 from a manufacturers point of view f1 has to be the pinnacle of technology
2756497 when people say it cant be relevant because the cars are so different theyre missing the point its all about training engineers and the development of long term intellectual property

2756513 theres nothing wrong with trying out new things once in a while besides reinas paying
2756514 you need a little excitement in your life i promise youll be thanking us for bringing you here before the night is over
2756515 yeah itll be fun come on the host is right ahead
2756516 i think this is a mistake we could get into real trouble
2756517 the only trouble we might get into is if reinas dad found out we were patronizing a place other than one of those her family owns
2756518 ill just tell daddy i was checking out the competition
2756519 getting into an upright position when she saw reina pouring assiduously over the menu the dark haired maiden asked in a low voice
2756520 are you two done with that yet im feeling a little hungry i guess i could do with some food
2756521 oh my god eri i knew you were innocent but this this is too much
2756522 eririn the menu is for picking out who you want to accompany you for the night for example if you happened to take a fancy to the host who showed us in you could pick him he was rather cute that chinese accent was kinda sexy
2756523 accompany me why would i want to be accompanied wait dont tell me this is what i think it is
2756524 bingo this is a host club host clubs have been around for more than four decades the first one reportedly opened in tokyo in 1966
2756525 dont worry so much were here to enjoy ourselves so forget about everything else
2756526 from my observation shes a feisty one she could probably hold down some hard liquor but wheres the fun in getting her smashed too quickly ill start her off with red wine

2756534 a man came through a door with a gun in his hand
2756535 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i watch raw video footage of the toronto explosions just managed to get out of there in time
2756536 we are confident that the games coming to china not only promotes our economy but also enhances all social conditions including education health and human rights
2756537 it is not unfair to give unique preference to monogamous heterosexual relationships if that preference and those marriages benefit all of society including homosexuals or potential homosexuals
2756538 whenever science and religion disagree one or the other or both of them are wrong
2756539 regarding the ordaining of all worthy men to the priesthood
2756540 the lord is willing if the negro accepts the gospel with real sincere faith and is really converted to give him the blessings of baptism and the gift of the holy ghost if that negro is faithful all his days he can and will enter the celestial kingdom he will go there as a servant but he will get celestial glory
2756541 for behold they the sons of cain had hardened their hearts against him that they had become like unto a flint wherefore as they were white and exceedingly fair and delightsome that they might not be enticing unto my people the lord god did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them
2756542 when all the other children of adam have had the privilege of receiving the priesthood and of coming into the kingdom of god and of being redeemed from the four quarters of the earth and have received their resurrection from the dead then it will be time enough to remove the curse from cain and his posterity
2756543 there are three main reasons why people marry outside their race some do it for the shock factor some do it to show they arent prejudiced and some people really just dont see color
2756544 the state of scientific research on the causes of homosexuality
2756545 does giving a legal preference to mixed gender desires and marriages benefit the whole of society
2756546 does restricting legal marriage to monogamous heterosexual relationships benefit all of society
2756547 no natural method by which two males or two females can create offspring in which both partners contribute genetically
2756548 a father and a mother collaborate in rearing children that share a genetic contribution from both parents
2756549 the state of scientific research on the causes of homosexuality
2756550 the gospel message of salvation is not carried affirmatively to them blacks
2756551 and if the normalizers have their way and it becomes criminal to give any social or legal preference to reproductively productive patterns of marriage and family why would any rational person give their allegiance to such a community such a legal system such a state or nation
2756552 expert clinical judges could not distinguish the projective test protocols of nonclinical homosexual men from a comparable group of heterosexual men nor were there differences in adjustment ratings
2756553 removed from the sample anyone who struck her as obviously pathological
2756554 the studies of twins who were adopted and raised apart comparing identical twins who share all the same genes fraternal twins who are no more alike than ordinary siblings and non twin siblings raised apart
2756555 fraternal twins were twice as likely as ordinary siblings to both be gay and identical twins were five times as likely but even identical twins were both homosexual only about half the time
2756556 there is probably a genetic component genes are certainly not the sole cause of homosexual desires
2756557 sharing the same womb is a strong contributing factor too so that hormones nutrition deficiencies or even acidity during gestation might be strong contributors
2756558 the brains physical structures can change in response to human behavior
2756559 overdominant or sexually inappropriate behavior by mothers and hostile or distant behavior by fathers
2756560 we advise fathers if you dont hug your sons some other man will
2756561 a very painful groan rose from the audience i looked around and saw heads shaking couples looking at each other and a general sense of horror filled the room
2756562 the incidence of this dysfunction can be minimized and where it occurs anyway its negative effects on the individual and the rest of society can be minimized
2756563 an attack on homosexuals a desire to commit genocide against the homosexual community
2756564 all gay men under a certain age would be catholic
2756565 not everybodys introduction to homosexuality was the beautiful fulfilment of an idyllic dream
2756566 ah of course you wont admit that it doesnt fit the public story that supports your political agenda
2756567 cautious fearful easily hurt easily slighted easily offended self protective
2756568 the picture that emerges from a dispassionate view of the existing science as well as the biographies of hundreds and thousands of actual heterosexuals is that heterosexuality is not just one thing it does not manifest itself the same way in all persons identified as heterosexuals it does not follow one unalterable course many people have heterosexual experiences or desires and fantasies in adolescence yet grow up to be fully functional at least for a time in homosexual relationships
2756569 heterosexuals are not exactly alike and neither is their degree of heterosexual exclusivity
2756570 we got married because we could if we could have gotten married in the united states we would have when the opportunity to get married in canada presented itself we grabbed it as a couple we wanted the same rights and the same social recognition our heterosexual friends have we also got married because just like coming out public figures need to do that to make the rest of the world aware i think its important that people are made aware because at the end of the day its a civil rights issue
2756571 so if my friends insist on calling what they do
2756572 i saw children struggling with the same weight problems i had and i believe it was due to their steady diet of high sugar and high fat foods with little or no exercise
2756573 we are a nation of undisciplined people we lack a sense of order we like to trample on the law abuse positions offices and relationships we cant wait for our turn in any situation we are always in a hurry drive one way bend the rule destroy the city landscape because we want to build our palaces doctor the books look for short cuts to success lack respect for other human beings neighbours road users and even children we are always impatient very vain celebrate what is not important and wasteful we do not believe things can be done without corrupting the system or knowing someone we are very loud boastful and like to destroy any orderly society we visit through credit card visa and social security scam this is why people dont like us abroad
2756574 the apology resolution marks a unique step forward in the us coming as the country embraces its first black presidential nominee in barack obama
2756575 a n apology for centuries of brutal dehumanisation and injustices cannot erase the past but confession of the wrongs committed can speed racial healing and reconciliation and help americans confront the ghosts of their past
2756576 fundamental injustice cruelty brutality and inhumanity of slavery and jim crow
2756577 i hope that this is part of the beginning of a dialogue that this country needs to engage in concerning what the effects of slavery and jim crow have been
2756578 i think we started it and were going to continue
2756579 a day of blogging for justice blogging against extra judicial electrocution tasers
2756580 so many whites want to be able to say im not one of them those bad whites
2756581 hes a remarkably exotic variety of the faux african american but a wigger nonetheless
2756582 even genetically obama whose east african descent is apparent in his unusual features has only a distant relationship to the west africans who are the ancestors of almost all african americans
2756583 the plain fact is that they black americans tend to possess poorer native judgment than members of better educated groups thus they need stricter moral guidance from society
2756584 whats happening isnt that second generation immigrants are assimilating to american norms rather a portion of the immigrant population frustrated with stagnating wages and an economy thats less favorable to high school graduates than fifty years ago ends up dropping out of the system and assimilating downward toward the behaviors associated with the poorest native born whites and blacks
2756585 i couldnt have put it better if i said so myself come to think of it i have been saying that in vdare com since 2000
2756586 americas public schools have failed most mexican americans contrary to what they did for european americans
2756587 more mexican americans have failed americas public schools contrary to what asian americans have done
2756588 did chief obasanjo and his executive council have the authority to reward mallam ribadu with accelerated promotions in consultation with the police authorities
2756589 were these rewards done in fairness and were they justified

2756593 it predates me being involved in politics or him being involved in politics im older than him so i serve an older brother role i hope he feels ive been there for him and hes certainly been a very loyal and terrifically helpful colleague
2756594 one of the roles ive always wound up playing is being a translator telling people yes he has a different approach hes serious about change this is what it means and my relationship with him gives credibility to that
2756595 my dad is one of the people who taught me how to laugh
2756596 the group had sort of a smothers brothers like routine they would sing songs and they would tell topical stories talk about current events tell a few jokes sing songs and you know thats my dads personality

2756601 but he walks down the hall hes got a smile on his face hes likable youre still happy to see him
2756602 he understands the importance of the personal touch and that e mails and phone calls are not always appropriate
2756603 there are times when a face to face is just the right thing to do he dropped everything and hopped on a plane
2756604 colluded with the afc management to mis apply afc funds as a source of cheap trading money rather than being deployed to the critical developmental objectives for which the afc was established
2756605 i think the blue skies will come especially after todays rain
2756606 today is raining and tomorrow will have rain too that will help reduce the air pollution level we believe the current air flow will be helpful in the dispersion of pollutants in the air
2756607 you can control beijing as much as you like but youre not going to see much of an effect

2756698 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2756699 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather

2756702 his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set
2756703 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
2756704 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2756705 it lets us get deeper into some of the other characters that only have very small stories generally

2756847 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2756848 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2756849 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2756850 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2756851 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2756852 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2756853 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2756854 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

2756889 es dif cil jugar contra un equipo que se defiende con nueve tipos
2756890 los partidos duran 90 minutos y hay que tener la paciencia necesaria para buscar los espacios saber que si te agarran mal parado de contra por ah perd s el partido y si se cometen esos errores est s listo
2756891 no jugamos como quer amos pero bueno tenemos muy claro que hay un mont n de aspectos por mejorar y siempre es mejor hacerlo cuando se gana ya conseguimos la clasificaci n y eso es muy importante
2756892 ganar esta clase de partidos continu batista reaniman mucho al grupo los seis puntos que tenemos nos permiten estar m s tranquilos y trabajar mejor
2756893 fue un lindo gol y esos los goles que me gustan a m con movilidad y toque no soy de festejar pero por este grupo lo festejo me siento bien con ellos tienen claro los objetivos y ojal que los podamos cumplir
2756894 jugar cada tres d as con una temperatura como la de hoy como una humedad del 92 por ciento es imposible uno conf a en que siempre van a dar lo mejor estos jugadores pero todo lo que rodea al partido es contraproducente
2756895 yo al kun lo voy a bancar porque a ese tipo de jugadores hay que bancarlos debido a que son los que te ganan un partido en cualquier momento
2756896 lamentablemente sergio ag ero no tuvo la preparaci n necesaria y lo esta sintiendo pero por lo que dije antes lo voy a respaldar

2756899 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2756900 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2756901 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2756902 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2756903 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2756904 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2756905 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2756906 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2756907 and as for man his days are like grass he flourishes like a flower in the field when the wind blows over it it is gone and its place remembers it no more
2756908 and i think thats part of what is the pride of this family knowing that your uncle was fighting for freedoms that we now enjoy that we have here today
2756909 to be able to assemble in our churches tomorrow to have the freedom to speak our mind and many other freedoms that we enjoy in this country
2756910 it was on a slope below a japanese strongpoint on the north end of the island

2756912 same way i felt when first told about it its just like an absolute miracle my sister and i are born again christians and weve asked god why are you bringing him back to us
2756913 but its someone from our family who gave his life because he wanted to it was a big war it was important to the country and it should be important to our family
2756914 i named him that because every time wed get a group of guys he would find a car or a post or a wall or something to rest on

2756924 medicare isnt going to increase its payments to us because we move into a new hospital
2756925 were not raising prices or peaking them up because were opening this hospital
2756926 has to do with professional time and professional services and the technology that is used in providing those services and not so much the capital cost of the facilities
2756927 some local architects and planners have taken issue with the utilitys design for a public sidewalk and plaza on the site and several observers in the local construction industry have complained that the building is unnecessarily plush
2756928 if you look at health care design in general across the country an awful lot of hospitals are humdrum and something other than pleasant and attractive
2756929 i thought it was a lovely building well suited to the oregon context it was well sited on the river
2756930 i didnt feel it was in any way opulent it looked appropriately designed for the pacific northwest

2756949 there are no big problems there are just a lot of little problems
2756950 we have no problems only situations not all problems have solutions but all situations have outcomes
2756951 there is a time in the life of every problem when it is big enough to see yet small enough to solve
2756952 every problem has in it the seeds of its own solution if you don
2756953 i am grateful for all my problems after each one was overcome i became stronger and more able to meet those that were still to come i grew in all my difficulties

2757028 the first crisis was in 1993 when cfc separated from its parent community this was because its parent basically opposed the growingly clear call to cfc to do rapid massive and global evangelization
2757029 now we must be mindful that the enemy continues to seek to destroy gods authentic work
2757030 opposition to the church manifested in violation of catholic values disrespect and disobedience to bishops
2757031 in a recent letter to me dated may 27 cardinal stanislaw rylko president of the pontifical council for the laity also left it to individual bishops to recognize cfc ffl including that of our name

2757035 this for god and this for myself this for my soul and this other for my body
2757036 the first crisis was in 1993 when cfc separated from its parent community this was because its parent basically opposed the growingly clear call to cfc to do rapid massive and global evangelization with the split cfc grew rapidly and touched the lives of very many people of many different nationalities in many countries the 1990s were golden years for the evangelistic work of cfc
2757037 the next crisis was last year in 2007 cfc in the last few years had been veering away from its authentic call there came a greater focus on the social dimension of our work at the expense of proclaiming christ and evangelization there was even opposition to the church manifested in violation of catholic values disrespect and disobedience to bishops and later even outright attacks on the hierarchy

2757057 on the other hand our bishops continue to engage in civilities and seem not to be ready to stick by us they cannot just stay idle twiddling their thumbs and reading tea leaves albeit smoking pot
2757058 what you are doing to the least of my people

2757060 allotting his gifts to everyone according as he wills 114 he distributes special graces among the faithful of every rank but judgment as to their genuinity and proper use belongs to those who are appointed leaders in the church to whose special competence it belongs
2757061 not indeed all in the same way but each in that way which is proper to himself
2757062 not indeed to extinguish the spirit but to test all things and hold fast to that which is good
2757063 do to others as you would have them do to you
2757064 i shot the arrow in the air it fell to earth i knew not where for so swiftly it flew the sight could not follow it in its flight i breathed a song into the air it fell to earth i knew not where for who has sight so keen and strong that it can follow the flight of song long long afterward in an oak i found the arrow still unbroke and the song from beginning to end i found again in the heart of a friend
2757065 let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works and glorify your father who is in heaven
2757066 when you come to a town or village go in and look for someone who is willing to welcome you and stay with him until yo leave that place when you go into a house say peace be with you if the people in that house welcome you let you greeting of peace remain but if they do not welcome you or listen to you then leave that place and shake the dust off your feet i assure you that on the judgment day god will show more mercy to the people of sodom and gomorrah than to the people of that town
2757067 cfc is a lay catholic group established in 1981 by fr
2757068 we do not intend to prevent them from using the name cfc for as long as they strive to not let go of what it means to be truly cfc
2757069 with all our imperfections i am proud to be catholic and i want to bring passion in the church to serve god by serving the poor
2757070 because helping the poor knows no boundaries in creed faith background or wealth the bld found a common goal and has embraced the vision of gk in giving dignity and hope to the poor and homeless
2757071 live out their faith put love into action and feed the hungry
2757072 we went to the gk presentation and we understood why and everybody got involved
2757073 i was sceptical because nothing good has ever come out of the philippines i was one of those who bash the philippines actually i have talked to someone and he said the only way for the philippines to get better is to build a new race
2757074 i have guarded optimism about gk but i went ahead
2757075 i love its holistic approach it is not just a housing project what gk does is to transform residents those who have vices are given christian life values through the christian life program there are livelihood projects a preschool for the children of the beneficiaries and a youth development program i saw the transformation and along the way i got convinced this is the way to go gk is a good vehicle
2757076 i realized that gk is the real deal may pag asa sa ating bayan we just hope that we can continue the movement of change with the help of expats and will involve all filipinos we should bring it out and let everyone know the miracle of gk that is transforming the filipinos
2757077 as a community we have to be engaged in a mission sharing in the work of jesus christ to the poor i realized that the reason why am i disciple is so that that i can serve the poor people
2757078 gk not only provide shelter for the poor but also to assist them in building a self sustaining socio economic community in their villages it is one of the most successful and innovative ventures on nation building because it taps the beautiful values of bayanihan and pakikisama
2757079 we can see this by easily judging people for corruption immorality lust pride laziness and other vices and even comparing nations and gauze their level of wickedness
2757080 i mean his grace because he is god made man in the sense that he took our human nature to save us from our sins
2757081 they seven capital sins precisely express the attachment to worldly realities from which only gods grace can liberate
2757082 gods grace comes through prayer and gods word its not money that is the root of evil but the seven inordinate loves or capital sins pride covetousness or avarice lust anger gluttony envy and sloth
2757083 without the grace of jesus our world would be living in darkness and the shadow of death
2757084 when it was clear to me that poverty was not primarily about economics when it was clear to me that corruption was not primarily about law it also became clear to me that despair perpetuates poverty perpetuates corruption i learned this because the entry of hope changes everything as though hope were the light that transforms night to day i learned that what gawad kalinga does which is the most important is to rearrange the ingredients of life so that hope can emerge with basis
2757085 the entry of hope changes everything as though hope were the light that transforms night to day i learned that what gawad kalinga does which is the most important is to rearrange the ingredients of life so that hope can emerge with basis
2757086 there could conceivably be a relativistic attitude towards catholic doctrine so prevalent in certain sectors in cfc gk and we should be terrified as well
2757087 in the context of cfc and gawad kalinga i believe the basis for such hope is the faith that has been embedded in the heart of a cfc follower and the truth of jesus fully revealed in the catholic church
2757088 a great leaders courage to fulfill his vision comes from passion not position
2757089 one thing a lot of us miss when we talk about gk is the driving force behind gk i still have not heard a leader of gk glorify god when giving a talk about gk and in the end it is gk that is glorified not god i hope this changes
2757090 and to the jews i became as a jew that i might win jews to those who are under the law as under the law though not being myself under the law that i might win those who are under the law to those who are without law as without law though not being without the law of god but under the law of christ that i might win those who are without law to the weak i became weak that i might win the weak i have become all things to all men that i may by all means save some and i do all things for the sake of the gospel that i may become a fellow partaker of it
2757091 now is the time to follow the wind to walk alone
2757092 thats pure harassment you can attack my management style but not my integrity ive been protecting my integrity for years
2757093 is that estafa ill let my freshmen students at the ateneo de manila handle it and im very sure they can handle it
2757094 it was given due course faster than the complaint against joc joc bolante
2757095 one thing a lot of us miss when we talk about gk is the driving force behind gk i still have not heard a leader of gk glorify god when giving a talk about gk and in the end it is gk that is glorified not god i hope this changes
2757096 he will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left
2757097 then the king will say to those on his right come you who are blessed by my father
2757098 then the righteous will answer him and say lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you drink when did we see you a stranger and welcome you or naked and clothe you when did we see you ill or in prison and visit you
2757099 and the king will say to them in reply amen i say to you whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine you did for me
2757100 you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain
2757101 frank being convinced to join the plan by the easter playboys and bunnies
2757102 although written last year this article has again made the rounds in an effort to explain the motivations and actuations of what the author calls the
2757103 beginning with the election of pope john paul ii in 1978 catholicism has become a steadily more evangelical church
2757104 not all who call me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven
2757105 whatever so say to the least of my brother you say it to me
2757106 whatever you do to the least of my brother you do it to me
2757107 this stands to reason more now with the pronouncement of the vatican that padillas group can co exist with cfc global in any part of the world on top of this the approval of the local securities and exchange commission sec provides the same group with the legal license to operate in the philippines
2757108 this brings us to the need to cut through the heart and core of making us believe that compensating life for life is morally justifiable are pfizer and cfc gk morally absolved of the sin of killing unborn children because these are compensated anyway by the many lives they save by providing medicines and curing illnesses such as cancer tb etc particularly in depressed areas this is precisely the danger the vatican wishes to avoid when a compensating philanthropy is used as a justification for wholesale abortions
2757109 brother you just wrote that you dont agree that we should post speeches of the ic here do you have any special reason for this
2757110 this stands to reason more now with the pronouncement of the vatican that padillas group can co exist with cfc global
2757111 the good bishop claver would like to make us believe that such good deeds absolve the evils wrought by the killing of millions of unborn children to subscribe to this notion of compensating philanthrophy is dangerous because put to extremes it can justify a lot of evil masked as good
2757112 accepting such funding creates confusion among the faithful as they give the impression that abortion and the production distribution and use of contraceptives and abortifacients are acceptable practices
2757113 the good effect must be sufficiently desirable to compensate for the allowing of the bad effect
2757114 besides musing about faps missed opportunities for greatness are generally ok but let us be careful in hinting melancholy to the point of romanticizing his talent there are plenty of our brethren out there similarly endowed who are consistently truthful loving and trustworthy unlike this leader who turned his back against his people spewing all the evil words he could to damn them
2757115 ah well there it is at least we can now deal with it if it needs dealing
2757116 it has come to my attention that my critique of the speech of tony meloto in ateneo has been forwarded from a confidential mailing list to the cfc ffl of frank padilla which has mass e mailed my post to their supporters as well as to cfc members in order to defame the cfc international council
2757117 now because of the indiscretion of that mailing list member the cfc ffl is gleefully using my good name and is hiding behind my reputation in order to bring down tony meloto and the cfc international council
2757118 as i took pains to point out in my original posting it was not my intention to bring down tony meloto
2757119 i am ready to stand by my words and to face like a man whatever controversy comes my way but it grieves me that my words are now being used in favor of a group the cfc ffl that i have not ceased to warn people against
2757120 oftentimes we are not conscious that the higher collective good is sacrificed for self and kin
2757121 this is exactly why we have to renew our family first including ourselves to be able to move forward in building the church of the poor
2757122 the teachings of the catholic church have fullness of truth
2757123 on ffls dearth for materials to the extent of wanting to quote or blast through email anything from any sympathetic source let me admonish
2757124 we must guard against any temptation to view doctrine as divisive and hence an impediment to the seemingly more pressing and immediate task of improving the world in which we live
2757125 the road of ecumenism ultimately points towards a common celebration of the eucharist
2757126 relativistic attitude towards catholic doctrine so prevalent in certain sectors in cfc gk
2757127 the church forcefully and specifically exhorts all the christian faithful to learn the surpassing knowledge of jesus christ by frequent reading of the divine scriptures ignorance of the scriptures is ignorance of christ
2757128 in order that the full and living gospel might always be preserved in the church the apostles left bishops as their successors they gave them their own position of teaching authority
2757129 the apostolic preaching which is expressed in a special way in the inspired books was to be preserved in a continuous line of succession until the end of time
2757130 the church in her doctrine life and worship perpetuates and transmits to every generation all that she herself is all that she believes
2757131 authentic teachers that is teachers endowed with the authority of christ who preach the faith to the people entrusted to them the faith to be believed and put into practice
2757132 the law of god entrusted to the church is taught to the faithful as the way of life and truth
2757133 evaluate the divine and human realities according to the spirit of god
2757134 it is exercised under the guidance of the sacred teaching authority in faithful and respectful obedience to which the people of god accepts that which is not just the word of men but truly the word of god
2757135 let the cfc members experience of jesus in their daily lives express the real lived out teachings of the christian faith
2757136 the faithful therefore have the right to be instructed in the divine saving precepts that purify judgment and with grace heal wounded human reason they have the duty of observing the constitutions and decrees conveyed by the legitimate authority of the church even if they concern disciplinary matters these determinations call for docility in charity
2757137 being pro life is being pro god and being pro god is being pro poor
2757138 i can not stand the duplicity of our church leaders both lay and clergy i will remain respectful of them but i will continue to question ang kanilang duplicitous mssages
2757139 apart from an individuals judgment about his worthiness to present himself to receive the holy eucharist the minister of holy communion may find himself in the situation where he must refuse to distribute holy communion to someone such as in cases of a declared excommunication a declared interdict or an obstinate persistence in manifest grave sin
2757140 but it is to the credit of the church that these bad popes never came out with crazy doctrines and they never were the source of any heresy
2757141 in the name of jesus we cast out the negative humour about c zy popes amen
2757142 if by the roman church you mean its head or pontiff it is beyond question that he can err even in matters touching the faith he does this when he teaches heresy by his own judgement or decretal in truth many roman pontiffs were heretics the last of them was pope john xxii 1334
2757143 we foresaw that together with them also honorius before pope of old rome is cast out of the holy catholic church of god and anathematized for we have found by his writings sent to the heretic sergius that he followed the thinking of the latter in everything and continued his impious principles to sergius the heretic anathema to cyrus the heretic anathema to honorius the heretic anathema
2757144 unity in essentials liberty in non essentials and charity in all
2757145 it is acceptable for the laity to objectively question towards this end but it must be done with respect and in the correct spirit of seeking maturity as a follower of christ to grow more in the knowledge of love of god and neighbor
2757146 hey jesus cant be the saviour he had a bad disciple
2757147 but in your hearts set apart christ as lord always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have but do this with gentleness and respect keeping a clear conscience so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in christ may be ashamed of their slander
2757148 for the holy ghost was promised to the successors of peter not so that they might by his revelation make known some new doctrine but that by his assistance they might religiously guard and faithfully expound the revelation or deposit of faith transmitted by the apostles
2757149 each one of us must come to a clear understanding of these issues guided by the churchs teachings
2757150 regarding its substance then faith does not grow with the passage of time for whatever has been believed since was contained from the start in the faith of the ancient fathers as regards its explication however the number of articles has increased for we moderns explicitly believe what they believed implicity
2757151 but it is to the credit of the church that these bad popes never came out with crazy doctrines and they never were the source of any heresy
2757152 if in effect crazy church doctrines were there indeed could emanate or emanated from sane popes while the
2757153 a clear understanding of the issues guided by the churchs teachings
2757154 1 peter 3 15 16 says but in your hearts set apart christ as lord
2757155 i will serve in the community where i received my baptism in the holy spirit
2757156 should they try to protect those who were speaking out against them
2757157 cd its up to you if you want to publish this
2757158 our god is the god of creation time space and history and he has called cfc as his own
2757159 we know that all things work for good for those who love the lord who are called according to his purpose
2757160 you know what unity of ffl and cfc is not visible in this generation it is in ours
2757161 cfc ic has designed suggestions and recommendations on how to improve and strengthen the relationship between our shepherds bishops and cfc ic so that together we can fulfill our shared mission of spreading gods will to all
2757162 we have lined up christian life and community values programs for 62 000 settlers along the railroad tracks now recoated in bulacan cavite laguna and taguig and take care of ofws and their families left behind in the philippines
2757163 cfc ic has designed suggestions and recommendations on how to improve and strengthen the relationship between our shepherds bishops and cfc ic so that together we can fulfill our shared mission of spreading gods will to all
2757164 cfc is a lay catholic group established in 1981 by fr
2757165 while ic had been asking its members to be still conveniently it encourages blogs like this that is unchristian and biased
2757166 this blog maligns anybody who do not agree with ic may it be a cardinal a bishop or a brother
2757167 honestly i get an overload you can only talk of point up to a certain extent pardon me brothers but your exposure almost equates to a well i thought it better not to say the word
2757168 none is as blind as those who refuse to see and none is as deaf as those who refuse to hear
2757169 for example 75 finished the yfl camp in torino italy can you as them how they manage to have a youth camp how they deceived even the parish priest in that area and the report that 90 of vienna austria is with them brod or sis before you make a comment pagisipan mo munang mabuti
2757170 for evil to triumph it is enough for good men to do nothing
2757171 frank is a deceiver you were all deceived and now you are reaping the whirlwind the real cfc is no longer in our midst this was a moral scourge waiting to happen since you broke away because the stain of pride remained with the two groups
2757172 sins of the father shall be visited on the children
2757173 we have a saying here if you want to get rich in the philippines you should start a religious group
2757174 be careful not to make a show of your righteousness before people if you do so you do not gain anything from your father in heaven when you give something to the poor do not have it trumpeted before you as the hypocrites do in order to be praised by the people i assure you they have been already paid in full
2757175 but the scripture also says you shall not put the lord your god to the test
2757176 leaving the physical manifestations of the community i e governing council the name logo etc but they remain steadfast and loyal to the charism of cfc
2757177 seeing as the vast majority of the members of cfc had no idea about what went on acknowledgment might be more important than atonement and is actually long overdue
2757178 visit the areas where the real work is being done may i propose that sector or provincial visits be as frequent as foreign trips
2757179 no one lights a lamp and puts it under a bowl instead it is put on the lampstand where it gives light for everyone in the house
2757180 i assure you that if you have faith as big as a mustard seed you can say to this hill go from here to there and it will go you could do anything
2757181 unless the lord builds the house it is painful for those who build it

2757192 cfc ffl has all the rights to use the name couples for christ because frank padilla is its founder and ffl is consistent with the vision mission of the true and genuine couples for christ which has never veered away from its original purpose while remaining faithful and loyal to the catholic church authorities
2757193 so how can some leaders and members of couples for christ global gk
2757194 they try to poison the minds of their members about my purported
2757195 my intention really is to save couples for christ from utter destruction at the hands of the enemy
2757196 priests need to exercise authority over couples for christ in their parishes after all it is within the realm of the priests duties to govern
2757197 all the members of cfc must be made aware of the existing problems within cfc
2757198 the members should even protest about what their international council is doing disobeying the bishops
2757199 i like and i commend cfc foundation for family and life headed by frank padilla because they work very hard for the restoration and the reformation of couples for christ may the other members follow your example
2757200 cfc ic has designed suggestions and recommendations on how to improve and strengthen the relationship between our shepherds bishops and cfc ic so that together we can fulfill our shared mission of spreading gods will to all
2757201 we have lined up christian life and community values programs for 62 000 settlers along the railroad tracks now recoated in bulacan cavite laguna and taguig and take care of ofws and their families left behind in the philippines
2757202 be a peacemaker and a person who unites he himself must not be a the cause of disunity he must not confuse laypeople by confronting those who are involved in lay movements or groups about where there loyalties lie when there is no cause for such he must not drive people away but rather draw them in
2757203 and by the way the church is not expected to serve the interest of couples for christ it should be the other way around couples for christ should serve the interests of the church
2757204 go just live with them and speak if you have to
2757205 forgive him for he did not know what he is saying or doing
2757206 after ive read the article about gk i felt very inspired and enthusiastic in following up gk i really strived hard to know a lot about gk and convince my fellow members that this is a good vehicle to help the poor
2757207 they had a lot of reservations charity begins at home they tell me why not start here bakit sa pilipinas na hindi natin nakikita ganun mentality nila why in the philippines we dont see it anymore that was their mentality they wanted us to donate in the us and not in the philippines
2757208 in the beginning they would not see the real purpose of what we do but when i brought back some pictures and releases about gk its like they have embraced gk they were very happy with the decision to donate you have this feeling that it feels so good to help
2757209 after high school i worked on a farm my aunts could not send me to school because they also have children luckily there were people who gave me a break i dont know any skills but i have a neighbor who let me study stenography at a school that owed him my neighbor said ok if you cant pay me in full just let zozimo study in your school to lessen your debt and that was my first break
2757210 160 the permanent principles of the churchs social doctrine 341 constitute the very heart of catholic social teaching
2757211 2 the adaptation and renewal of the religious life includes both the constant return to the sources of all christian life and to the original spirit of the institutes and their adaptation to the changed conditions of our time
2757212 why cant you guys accept that some people will have different views from yours i noticed that every time anybody such as a member like andy of quezon and now this priest has different view you attack them

2757218 p s if you dont mind are you we might say a catholic thinker
2757219 on certain issues i think the church hierarchy in the philippines has gotten it wrong
2757220 there is nothing controvertible for instance in the crisis of legitimacy that surrounds the president like a pall of permanent exhaust
2757221 the bishops position on population growth and the marital responsibility of catholic couples continues to be based mistakenly on what the great theologian bernard haring characterized with deliberate irony as the absolute sacredness of the biological
2757222 but on other issues i think the bishops called it right on the conflict tearing the couples for christ movement apart for instance the hierarchy has sought to honor the original charism of the movement that is only as it should be
2757223 genuineness and proper use belongs to those who are appointed leaders in the church to whose special competence it belongs

2757250 and they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship in breaking of bread and in prayers and fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles and all that believed were together and had all things in common
2757251 that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ

2757268 it is my dearest hope that military action will stop immediately and that they will abstain in the name of their common christian inheritance from further clashes and violence

2757285 lo que frena a microsoft de ser un participante mayor en el movimiento foss es el hecho de que no lo pueden hacer de una manera significativa por su fuente de ingresos no veo a microsoft diferente de cualquier corporaci n siguiendo sus intereses de negocios
2757286 no pensar que microsoft sea diferente a cualquier otra corporaci n
2757287 parte de mi trabajo es monitorear los anuncios de microsoft nuestro equipo provee un servicio importante a nuestros miembros y el mercado traduciendo lo que a veces son acciones confusas de microsoft vemos cambios en su tecnolog a que hacen m s f cil la interoperabilidad de linux y aplicaciones open source con su plataforma la intenci n de microsoft de dar soporte a la tecnolog a odf en office es un buen ejemplo de lo que seguimos vemos que publiquen sus protocolos t cnicos bajo t rminos que sean compatibles con el desarrollo y pr cticas de licenciamiento del open source
2757288 se necesita un deseo sincero de colaborar y hacer mejor software
2757289 microsoft es una compa a inteligente y un excelente competidor hacen a linux mejor cada d a siendo un fiero competidor pero operan bajo un modelo de desarrollo de software viejo que ya no se sostiene en la econom a actual del software los consumidores est n demandando apertura y elecci n algo que microsoft no entiende todav a linux uno de los primeros ejemplos de lo que se puede lograr con el modelo de desarrollo open source est en una posici n natural de aprovechar esta nueva din mica de mercado microsoft seguir luchando con dificultad
2757290 no intento seguir la tecnolog a de microsoft porque en la mayor a de los casos los cambios en la tecnolog a de microsoft no tienen efectos repentinos en la comunidad del software libre me preocupan m s sus amenazas legales al software libre y sus intentos de
2757291 mi meta a largo plazo es un mundo donde todos los usuarios de software sean libres de compartir y cambiar el software que usan en otras palabras un mundo donde todo el software sea libre en la extensi n en que compa as como microsoft y apple se dediquen a distribuir software que niegue esas libertades se oponen a estas metas
2757292 se mueve completamente a servicios como hotmail abandonando software privativo como windows y ms office a ese punto puede hacer contribuciones al software libre de forma que avance la comunidad en mayor o menor medida sin embargo ausente tal cambio fundamental espero que cualquiera de las contribuciones de microsoft haga ser de valor marginal para cualquiera en el mundo libre
2757293 microsoft est haciendo grandes esfuerzos para bloquear la adopci n del sistema gnu linux y openoffice org
2757294 que microsoft considera la gpl versi n 3 una defensa efectiva de la libertad del usuario
2757295 windows vista le permite a microsoft instalar cambios de software sin preguntarle al usuario no se puede poner m s feo que eso
2757296 es com n en el campo de la computaci n equipar el mal con microsoft pero eso es un error lleva a la gente a ignorar las cosas malas hechas por otras compa as muchas de las cuales son igual de malas microsoft no es la nica compa a cuyas pr cticas de negocios pisotean las libertades de los usuarios miles de compa as distribuyen software privativo lo que significa mantener a los usuarios divididos e indefensos eso est mal no importa qu compa a lo haga
2757297 no tiendo a comparar a linux con otros s o s me importa hacer a linux mejor que s mismo ver lo que otros est n haciendo no es tan relevante obviamente cosas como trabajar bien con otros sistemas operativos es importante pero eso es un rea donde no puedo ayudar realmente ya que no uso otros sistemas en casa
2757298 no recuerdo la ltima vez que tom cualquier decisi n que tuviera algo que ver con microsoft
2757299 y si podr n superar su miedo irracional a la gpl no lo s
2757300 no creo que haya un microsoft sospecho que hay muchos ingenieros de ms que usan software open source y probablemente lo usen en sus casas aparte de los testing de compatibilidad relacionados al trabajo tambi n sospecho que diferentes partes de la compa a tienen ideas muy diferentes respecto al open source y no creo que est n de acuerdo
2757301 dicho eso claramente algunas partes de microsoft son bastante anti open source y s si lo pueden socavar lo har n alegremente
2757302 c mo luchas con algo que es m s una idea y una forma de hacer las cosas que un competidor directo en el mercado
2757303 b sicamente me detuve porque no creo que el miedo y odio que es tan com n o tal vez no tan com n probablemente sea muy vocal sea tan saludable
2757304 mientras que obviamente no soy un fan de microsoft creo que realmente eran buenos hace m s de diez a os porque realmente le daban a la gente lo que quer a a un bajo costo

2757404 for me two words sum it up belief and conviction we played some good stuff but we just need to believe we can go and score goals
2757405 the players have to believe me when i tell them theyre good enough although i felt my boys were outstanding they passed the ball really well
2757406 once rangers scored we went chasing it a bit we always seem to come back on ourselves
2757407 watching it as a coach i can make it better i know that the players have to believe me
2757408 ive read goldilocks and the three bears for 25 years im only passing on that wisdom to them were at out best when were playing expansive football
2757409 big higgie was confident we told him to put it straight down the middle and he needed to hit it with a bit more conviction
2757410 its the final third goals have to come from all over the place you just cant rely on the strikers
2757411 its just disappointing that the boys put so much into the game and never got anything out it
2757412 i felt we had the game under control and we did all the attacking
2757413 we were down to 10 men because david van zanten needed stiches and lazy defending from midfielders saw us go 1 0 down i wont tolerate that
2757414 we should have scored a couple of goals but we blunt in front of goal
2757415 its all ifs and buts but when you get chances like that you must bury them
2757416 maybe he froze a little bit but he should have punished them
2757417 if you look at positives we were on the front foot for most of the match
2757418 i thought team spirit and teamwork won us the game today
2757419 we competed really well and looked dangerous on the break
2757420 i was confident in my players and what theyve done over the last six weeks so that performance just confirmed that
2757421 when you score goals at any level i always believe you can score at the top level
2757422 andrew wants to do well for himself and he wants to do well for the team im excited about seeing him develop in the next three years
2757423 their spirit was what i needed and this was very entertaining
2757424 all the time football is a wonderful game and win lose or maybe you make a draw but congratulations to motherwell a fantastic team a very good team
2757425 but congratulations to my team i have been here four weeks and i think this is the best game i have seen
2757426 i am for passion and for fighting i was eight times operated on one knee but i stand up all the time and came back to professional football
2757427 if the player sees a coach who is positive his body language is positive
2757428 also you must be strong and you must have discipline i think today there was not only a game from the fighting and the spirit we played very good football some of the time
2757429 in the end we won 3 2 and i hope we can enjoy these three points
2757430 we lost very poor goals and thats what cost us the game
2757431 if we can tighten up a bit and be a bit more decisive when the ball can be cleared then well win more matches
2757432 were not going to accept the type of defending when we lost the goals but generally the commitment fitness play and creativity was there
2757433 i think we lost them at a stage in the first half when we were dominating the game we looked the most likely team we were the most creative team
2757434 for the away team we had most of the possession in hearts last two thirds
2757435 but weve cost ourselves the game by losing two poor goals
2757436 we did expect to win we do expect to win i think we should have won this game
2757437 its a good result for them because im still convinced at this moment in time that were better than hearts
2757438 clearly theyve got a manager who has galvanised them and theyre going to be a decent team this season
2757439 but i would like to play them again next week and i would still take my team against them
2757440 our passion let us down there were too many good players that didnt play well today
2757441 after our midweek disappointment it was always going to be a tough game for us today and thats the way it turned out
2757442 were just pleased we managed to go on and win it
2757443 with the week that weve had it was one of those that you felt might have gone against us but it didnt and credit to allan for making the save
2757444 we went on to get the winner after that and we were pleased about that we managed to get the win and that was the most important thing for us
2757445 the biggest problem we have is that we have built up a reputation over the last 18 months and it got ruined in two games
2757446 their attitude and determination to play was something we have not had to question over the 18 months ive been the manager
2757447 lo que est escaseando es el crudo y no vemos como haya manera de sustituir vol menes que provienen de venezuela y del medio oriente eso es una ficci n

2757449 el nivel b rbaro de consumo que tienen eeuu y que van a tener que usar sus reservas
2757450 hemos advertido que los precios y las fluctuaciones no tienen nada que ver con los fundamentos del mercado sino que tienen que ver con acciones especulativas
2757451 si hace falta una reducci n de producci n de crudo para estabilizar los precios habr a que considerarlo
2757452 its just a ride and we can change it any time we want its only a choice no effort no work no job no savings and money a choice right now between fear and love
2757453 i thought it was a cracking game both teams were going hammer and tongs at each other
2757454 we got the goal through a great strike from jamie hamill but it could have been 2 2 or 3 3 and people would have been raving about the game
2757455 hes a couple of weeks behind in terms of fitness and i was going to take him off with 20 minutes to go
2757456 he was pumped up for his debut and maybe a bit rash for his booking but he will get better and better
2757457 the lad has got great pace and strength and chases and works hard for team
2757458 there somewhat is relief the day is over we overcame so much it was all kind of a whirlwind
2757459 and we got the nerves out and the mistakes out
2757460 i knew things were happening i couldnt control and that were obviously not very good
2757461 it was a little bit hard to go out from there
2757462 a few of us had tears in our eyes because we know how badly she wanted to be out there we said lets do it for her lets do it for our families lets do it for the people back home
2757463 well come back strongly in the team finals and fight for it
2757464 ive been doing it so well in training i think i just pulled so hard and i overrotated
2757465 i am very satisfied with the chinese girls performance if i can give them a score i would say 70 percent mainly for he kexin falling off the uneven bars its a big pity for her
2757466 maybe she was nervous because she wanted to perform her best

2757482 china started well but we were the ones to score after china had been reduced to 9 men it took us quite some time to score a second it was a big relief when this finally happened
2757483 against new zealand we only need a draw to advance to the last 8 but we will play to win new zealand may be considered as the weakest team in our group we will have to keep our concentration for 90 minutes
2757484 vielleicht k nnten sie mir erkl ren was der alles kann
2757485 some holidaymakers were afraid and left the beach but most of them stayed here
2757486 life goes on the terrorists cannot stop us from living our lives it is a peaceful place here and everybody knows everybody in the village there are no terrorists here and if they dare to disturb us we
2757487 look at the beach look at the people look at the girls
2757488 frankly im not aware of the suicide attack im having fun and thats all i care about right now
2757489 there are more than 1 000 vehicles parked already and at least 10 000 people are on the beach
2757490 they want to forget the pressure and the stress of the cities in my village we are safe 24 hours a day
2757491 as long as they protect the people and do not beat them up they are welcome
2757492 the order of the world is always right such is the judgment of god for god has departed but he has left his judgment behind the way the cheshire cat left his grin
2757493 baikal is the greatest lake in the world it is a limitless reserve and source for water that all of humanity can drink without any sort of purification
2757494 this is a priceless gift for everyone whether you live in or florida or kansas
2757495 we say that only romantics do this sort of work
2757496 theres a kind of work that just has to be done whether you like it or not and its just worked out that were the ones who have to do it
2757497 is an indicator of whether modern man can curb his appetite and preserve what nature has created
2757498 because of everything which has happened because of my performance because we qualified the atmosphere here is great and that helps a lot
2757499 ronaldinho deserves it hes a great player and a great person
2757500 if theres one truism in economics i believe its that recessions always kill inflation every time without a doubt theres no way around it even in stagflation once youre stuck in a recession your prices are going to plunge
2757501 so which is the better measure of inflationary expectations the spread between tips and treasuries or a spread between tips and a risk adjusted rate for all long bonds
2757502 there are critics though and i am one of them that think perhaps investors are not quite getting what they expect for a start the holdings in the index funds are market capitalisation weighted this sounds sensible of course except when you consider just how much the biggest companies dominate the portfolio the top one hundred stocks in america representing just 3 of the number of stocks in the index funds actually account for over 60 of the funds invested in vanguards fund
2757503 when you get down to the genuinely small capitalisation stocks there is actually very little money invested in each stock which is why it probably isnt surprising that over long periods of time the wilshire 5000 index performs pretty much the same as the big capitalisation growth stock dominated s amp p500 index
2757504 the art of creating a good portfolio is not about owning everything in market weighted proportions as the total market index does but in having significant exposure to every asset class and rebalancing the portfolio at an appropriate frequency
2757505 so if you want to take advantage of the rebalancing effect you are going to need to have a much larger small cap value exposure in your portfolio than just a couple of percent
2757506 while s amp p 500 index and total market funds make for effective pieces on an investment pie they should only be slices not the whole pie they just dont provide sufficient diversification as stand alone vehicles
2757507 the notion that compared with their large and mid cap counterparts small cap active equity managers are more likely to outperform their market segment
2757508 its a little disappointing that we havent performed as a batting unit
2757509 these are the guys who have won games for india and done so well for the country its just a matter of not clicking i dont know how it happened
2757510 we want to keep them well below a 100 when we go out there tomorrow
2757511 we were looking for a support bowler for murali hes come along and gone beyond expectations the important thing for him is to keep learning
2757512 i was very happy to get a hundred it was one of the most difficult hundreds to get
2757513 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
2757514 the troops have been positioned in nearby territory of tskhinvali and they have also been ordered not to respond to russian shelling to the extent possible
2757515 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous of escalation in the crisis
2757516 als ich studiert habe sagte man der mensch hat 150 000 gene
2757517 heute wei man es sind maximal 30 000 nicht mehr als eine maus hat lange meinte man ein gen hat eine funktion eines f r haut eines f r haare eines f r augen auch da musste man einsehen dass das bl dsinn ist
2757518 das hei t die nahrung entscheidet welche gene die k nigin verwendet und welche die arbeiterin
2757519 nahrung stress umweltchemie das steuert bis zu einem gewissen grad von au en welche gene in unserem k rper aktiv sind und welche nicht
2757520 unsere gene sind wie papier und bleistift aber was wir damit schreiben ist unsere sache
2757521 ich sage voraus dass wir feststellen werden dass sie wichtig ist um gene an oder abzuschalten
2757522 at this time we are happy with our agent and not looking for another one
2757523 no new uses have been identifed at this time but clearly its a very strategic location
2757524 its right next to the convention center it is the crossroads or transition from downtown to the oregon district so its location is very important
2757525 i have been training a lot with my brother to achieve this win
2757526 the main rules have not changed since the beginning of the competition 10 years ago we have six men or women sitting inside the sauna on each round and the winner is the last one to leave
2757527 there are no world records we cannot control all the factors like the temperature of the sauna or the water thrown into the stove
2757528 if he needs to blow his own trumpet well fine
2757529 but my mother who was a simple housewife she showed me the snake when i was a child
2757530 how dare this man come in here and name a snake after his wife
2757531 it gives the impression that people here depend on people from abroad to come and show us things in our own backyard
2757532 probably people have overreacted its nationalism going a bit awry
2757533 if we could give every individual the right amount of nourishment and exercise not too little and not too much we would have found the safest way to health
2757534 sab amos que se min ssemos o advers rio ter amos condi es de encaixar o contra ataque viemos para marcar o time deles e marcar os gols em velocidade mas isso n o aconteceu o erro nosso foi o passe no ltimo e pen ltimo passe
2757535 a situa o psicol gica da equipe era complicada estamos tentando recuperar o moral dos atletas estamos com algumas dificuldades em vencer fora de casa temos que trabalhar melhor esper vamos fazer um jogo melhor na parte ofensiva
2757536 acho que nas horas que a bola n o entrar temos que ter calma foi um jogo de igual para igual o jogo foi nos detalhes um time que quer ganhar tem que ter um acerto de 8 a 10 chutes o objetivo s o os gols e s faz gol quem chuta
2757537 a equipe atr s foi bem mas faltou mais agressividade vamos trabalhar para conseguir isso no pr ximo jogo

2757547 io e denny non ci sentivamo da qualche giorno da un paio di mesi eravamo un po in crisi ma non ero preoccupata una relazione fatta di alti e bassi poi la mattina del 15 luglio sono andata in edicola e ho visto il mio ragazzo in copertina su chi abbracciato alla falchi
2757548 dennis ha raccontato in giro di avermi lasciato giorni prima dello scoop dice cinzia a federica capozzi ma non vero lunica cosa che ha fatto prima di sparire nel nulla mandarmi un sms in cui diceva che nella sua vita erano cambiate molte cose e che avremmo dovuto parlarne questo a casa mia non vuol dire chiudere una storia
2757549 in questa estate dove si gioca a chi ruba luomo in palio un ricco servizio fotografico su chi anche anna falchi sta dando luomo che stato capace di rapirle ancora il cuore dopo il sofferto matrimonio come tutti i matrimoni damore sospiriamo con ricucci un gaudioso imprenditore ravennate di nome dennis montesi quattro anni in meno della trentaseienne falchi e una passione per le ferrari qualcosa ci dice non altrettanta per le felpe delle fiamme gialle il loro bacio in pubblico non lascia campo ad equivoci solo che una volta pubblicato spuntata anche la fidanzata del playboy la showgirl cinzia serra che con lui conviveva da dieci anni se non lo rubi ad unaltra non c gusto questo il nuovo mantra delle dive cinzia fa una cosa prendi le chiavi di casa e imprimi la scritta porco sulla testarossa del tuo ometto ma senza rancore tanto come andr a finire gi lo sappiamo

2757553 deber a saber que este modelo de financiaci n que tenemos ahora es fruto del acuerdo de zaplana y de aznar
2757554 que la voluntad de los socialistas es conseguir un modelo de financiaci n que nos ayude a posicionarnos con liderazgo y excelencia en espa a y en europa cosa que al presidente camps ni se le ha pasado por la cabeza
2757555 deber a hablando de financiaci n asumir su responsabilidad como vicepresidente del consell en la situaci n de extremo endeudamiento de la generalitat as como por esconder facturas para que ser n pagadas pasado el 2011
2757556 todos echamos en falta las inversiones del consell en mejorar regad os proteger acu feros mejorar las instalaciones h dricas facilitar la creaci n de desalinizadoras y sobre todo es una verg enza que con el tema del agua hayan enfrentado a este pueblo valenciano con otros pueblos vecinos
2757557 los socialistas en el gobierno y los socialistas valencianos invertimos invertiremos y haremos cuantas acciones sean necesarias para que no falte a esta tierra el suministro de agua ni para consumo humano ni para riego y cubriremos la incompetencia de este consell agotado y falto de toda iniciativa
2757558 es una burla que cotino comparezca despu s de tanta ausencia
2757559 sus actividades empresariales le ocupan m s tiempo que el gobierno que le encomend el agotado camps
2757560 debe saber cotino camps y el resto del consell que su tiempo se agota y que tras el congreso de los socialistas su tiempo de calma se ha terminado
2757561 la oposici n que van a tener conmigo enfrente ser implacable y no tendr n tiempo ni de respirar
2757562 todo el pueblo valenciano sabe que cotino es de todo menos proyecci n de futuro y de modernidad y que sus empresas e intereses empresariales le ocupan m s atenci n y prioridad que la gesti n de los intereses de la sociedad valenciana
2757563 seguramente el anuncio de camps de modificar el consell le ha hecho despabilar y empezar a hacer declaraciones contra los socialistas en vez de preocuparse de gestionar los intereses de los valencianos

2757574 he was one of those comics that was unique because of his approach his look his voice and the content of his material bernie fell into that category of people who were inherently different like when you saw them you knew they were different and when they spoke you knew they were different as comics were all brothers and ill miss him a lot he was a good friend of mine
2757575 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with macs wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are missed
2757576 he couldnt have been a nicer guy he just seemed like a real family man and just a nice guy on the set just very kind of normal guy
2757577 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
2757578 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2757579 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is
2757580 bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time
2757581 the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game
2757582 i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man amp my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2757583 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did
2757584 bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2757585 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father amp loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
2757586 ive seen him concentrating in pre season and he knows its going to be his season hes going to have an important part to play in the squad
2757587 the only thing theo maybe has to improve is his character hes a lovely guy on the pitch i keep saying to him he has to become more nasty after this he will be one of the best players in the premier league
2757588 when you are young at arsenal you have to make use of the people at the club use the facilities and improve

2757607 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of componentry the provision of specialists in the construction of ieds and authorising their emplacement across the province
2757608 we need to go to the facilities where these devices are constructed you could call them ied factories and we need to go after the people who are putting them together and thats precisely what weve been doing
2757609 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently under way what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province
2757610 yet another example of the good work theyre doing in oruzgan
2757611 theres something like 900 per head additional in this budget for pensioners and for seniors but i accept that many of them are doing it reallytough
2757612 this review will address the adequacy of social welfare payments including the age pension so we get it right for older australians who have helped build this nation
2757613 our argument is the fixed costs people face in terms of rent and utilities make that quite inequitable
2757614 it needs to move from the current 59 per cent to 66 per cent of the couples rate that represents a 30 a week increase it would cost about 1 billion
2757615 if youre a pensioner couple particularly if you own your home youre doing it tough but you can get by on the pension
2757616 my worry for them is when one partner passes away after the bereavement period they drop back to 60 per cent of payments with all the same costs except for one less mouth to feed
2757617 i think the only way to do it is either with major increases to the quarterly utilities allowance or change the differential it is a very expensive reform but i believe it is affordable for a wealthy country

2757621 sadly no party or ideology is immune from the scourge of racism
2757622 it could have a significant chilling effect on the reporting of the private lives of celebrities
2757623 the most significant changes to the privacy act in the 20 years of its existence
2757624 there is a strong expectation that special minister of state senator john faulkner will commit the government to act on the alrcs recommendations and that he will introduce relevant legislative amendments in the foreseeable future
2757625 protection of privacy needs to be balanced against the public interest in allowing the free flow of information and upholding freedom of speech
2757626 it has not been demonstrated that existing privacy protections fail to achieve this balance
2757627 the alrc has failed to demonstrate a breach of privacy by the media is not already dealt with by existing laws such as defamation and surveillance laws or self regulation by the media
2757628 the law would be irrelevant to ordinary citizens in whom the media has no interest it would be open to abuse by irresponsible claimants who would clog our already over burdened courts
2757629 such a law would simply allow rich people to employ lawyers in a bid to avoid scrutiny of their wrongdoing
2757630 it allows the rich powerful and celebrities to manipulate their images in the way they want them manipulated rather than having some transparency
2757631 they said privacy laws would be ok on the whole if anyone with a pr agent was exempt from taking an action
2757632 i think it may be a sensible development for the media as it would mean the defamation laws dont get stretched to be used as a substitute for proper protection against invasion of privacy
2757633 russian troops are heading south and the next place in that direction is the town of gori our troops are positioned to defend the town
2757634 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on unprecedented scale in these conditions our forces conducted redeployment
2757635 i believe that the position of the international community supported by australia is that georgia is an independent state its territorial sovereignty should be respected and therefore all states should exercise restraint and that includes the russian federation
2757636 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2757637 they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered this situation can be resolved peacefully

2757643 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2757644 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2757645 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2757646 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2757647 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2757648 we have been delivering balikbayan boxes from all over the country

2757651 we must literally deliver the box just in time that our client needs it
2757652 im sure my children grand children and even those grown ups would surely enjoy all we have sent this christmas
2757653 most of the items were bought in shopping malls during yearly sales

2757662 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2757663 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2757664 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2757669 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
2757670 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries
2757671 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago

2757673 the wcs team was on the shorelines north of teshekpuk lake on the beaufort sea studying the feeding of shorebirds before their southward migrations these shorelines have experienced dramatic erosion as the climate has warmed the scientists were working to understand how this erosion affects the ability of the shorebirds to get enough food energy before they migrated to asia south america and other distant sites

2757692 jeg er en mann som har en aldeles fantastisk kone vi er begge rundt 40 og har v rt sammen i over 20 r har barn og et sv rt godt liv sammen jeg elsker henne dypt og inderlig som menneske samtidig gj r hun meg faktisk mer gal av begj r n enn noen gang f r vi har hatt hektiske perioder med sm barn jobb og annet hvor sex har havnet lenger ned p listen men de siste rene etter hvert som barna er blitt st rre har vi hatt et vanvittig godt sexliv samtidig som vi opplever en harmoni i hverdagen som gj r livet godt leve min kone er en sv rt utadvendt og sosial person hun liker fl rte og vokser veldig p positiv oppmerksomhet p alle omr der de siste rene hvor barna er blitt st rre har hun f tt anledning til bruke mer tid p jobb og samtidig reist mer v rt mer ute og generelt v rt mer aktiv sammen med andre mennesker det har gitt henne masse positiv feedback og slik har hun blomstret f tt trygghet og kanskje opparbeidet en appetitt p enda mer positiv feedback gjennom hele v r tid sammen har vi hatt en felles fantasi om at hun er sammen med andre menn seksuelt gjerne i en litt horete rolle vi har s si hver gang vi har hatt sex snakket om dette og kraften i denne fantasien har ikke tapt seg snarere tvert imot f lgelig har hun ogs i en del r hatt en viss frihet til kunne realisere denne fantasien og for to r siden kom hun hjem fra et seminar og fortalte at hun hadde g tt til sengs med en annen mann det var en one night stand og slik sett relativt ufarlig men for v rt sexliv var det som helle bensin p b let jeg tenner vanvittig p henne fordi hun slik viser sin lyst og sitt begj r hun f r tenning av bli begj rt og vi tenner begge p spenningen og pningen for det ukjente etter denne opplevelsen har tanken om en fast elsker for henne blitt mer og mer sentral b de fordi det gir en viss trygghet og fordi det gir anledning til slike opplevelser oftere og de siste m nedene har min kone etablert kontakt med tre menn som hun vurderer som potensielle faste elskere hun har enn ikke g tt til sengs med noen av dem men har brukt sv rt mye tid p kommunisere med dem hun holder meg informert men holder ogs litt for seg selv denne prosessen har gjort b de henne og meg konstant k te og det gnistrer bare vi er i n rheten av hverandre men i noen f edruelige yeblikk begynner jeg likevel f kalde f tter min kone er intelligent h yt utdannet empatisk og har gjennom over 20 r aldri l yet til meg jeg vet ogs at jeg er en attraktiv mann med mange sterke sider men det er denne lille usikkerheten om at f lelser ikke alltid kan kontrolleres hun forsikrer meg om at dette handler om spenning sex og lyst og at hun er lojal mot meg hun sier at man aldri har noen garanti mot forelskelse det kan like gjerne skje i en jobbsituasjon hun sier hun g r inn i dette med en viss kynisme og kontroll men hun sier ogs at ting n har g tt s langt at det er for sent stoppe hun vil ha dette sp rsm let som jeg tror er aktuelt for flere er derfor om jeg skal stole p min kone n r hun sier at hun er i stand til h ndtere et slikt forhold uten bli forelsket er det mulig ha et stabilt samliv hvor kvinnen har en slik elsker over tid uten at det truer v r relasjon eller er dette en vanvittig ferd mot slutten
2757693 hun forsikrer meg om at dette handler om spenning sex og lyst og at hun er lojal mot meg hun sier at man aldri har noen garanti mot forelskelse det kan like gjerne skje i en jobbsituasjon hun sier hun g r inn i dette med en viss kynisme og kontroll men hun sier ogs at ting n har g tt s langt at det er for sent stoppe hun vil ha dette
2757694 rlig pen og ansvarlig ikke monogami med utgangspunkt i ett prim rt forhold samlivet med prim rpartneren har f rste prioritet og er i utgangspunktet p noen m ter unikt men det er full penhet omkring eventuelle forhold til andre partnere grensen mellom pen trofasthet og polyamori kan v re noe flytende i de tilfellene der et forhold til en annen partner utvikler seg mot et mer komplett kj rlighetsforhold som best r over tid
2757695 etter mer tyve rs ekteskap er jeg blitt truffet av lynet
2757696 utseendet hans tiltalte meg enormt selv om han kanskje ikke objektivt sett er spesielt pen jeg ble dessuten fascinert av sjarmen og humoren hans og all oppmerksomheten han ga meg men aller viktigst var kjemien at vi s umiddelbart fant tonen sammen som om vi skulle ha kjent hverandre alltid
2757697 i stedet tenker jeg p at man selv er med skape denne tilstanden gjennom forf lge og dyrke det som i utgangspunktet er en fascinasjon og tiltrekning
2757698 under alle omstendigheter hvis du skal klare frigj re deg fra forelskelsen m du aktivt kutte ham ut det inneb rer for det f rste at du m slutte samarbeide med ham om det lar seg gj re for det andre m du bekjempe din tilb yelighet til tenke p ham det er kanskje vanskeligere enn unng treffe ham for noe av forelskelsens vesen er nettopp besettelsen
2757699 goddagmann kseskaft ja dette var jo en spennende analyse av f lelsesverden og andre verdner av energi og kjemi langt bakenfor mental 3 dimensjonalitet har vi virkelig kommi s langt at det bruke hode mener overkj re en hver annen virkelighet enn inndoktrinert tenkning og analyse analysere en slik situasjon og tema blir vel temmelig d f dt greit nok at det ofte river hardt mellom hode og hjerte men dette tilsier vel ikke n dvendigvis at l sningen alltid ligger p intellektets side ihvertfall ikke hvis en ogs vil leve litt fritt ikke bare sitte som en fange i en liten boks av skulle skulle ikke r mitt r d ville heller v re v g kjenn p det uten tilkludre opplevelsen med tankespinn dette betyr jo ikke at en beh ver dra det i hverken den ene eller andre retningen men v g allikevel kjenn p det kunne ogs hende at det hele dreier seg mere om egne fortrengte behov og lyster enn den personen som har vekket flammen hvem vet eller kanskje det bare er noe som m utforskes det er jo ikke alltid ting ser ut slik vi tror snarere sjelden sp r du meg lykke til

2757706 alle som uttaler seg offentlig om private forhold m regne med at dette kan bli plukket opp andre steder
2757707 men vi mangler et felles og vi greier visst ikke utvikle det

2757717 polyamori har tendens til v re en smeltedigel hvor du enten finner ut hvordan skape forhold eller forholdene omskapes til noe annet slik har vi blitt smeltet ned og omskapt mange ganger i l pet av prosessen
2757718 om hvordan vi nsker kommunisere og om hvordan vi nsker krangle og hvordan vi nsket behandle konflikter og likeverd og slike ting
2757719 vi nsker at v rt forhold skal vare for alltid vet vi at det er viktig at det utvikler seg sunt og det er mulig p et visst punkt at det vil v re viktig for oss ikke v re sammen hva vi virkelig nsker for oss selv er ha en f lelsesmessig forpliktelse til hverandre alltid v re st ttende og oppl ftende og alle de andre positive tingene

2757733 there were advantages to having more than two parents there was always an adult around when we needed one im sure my memories are biased with childish selfishness but being able to always find someone when i needed to talk was a thing most of my peers didnt share not to mention there was always someone to take me places or do things with me

2757736 but there are other types of open honest responsible nonmonogamous relationships that some wouldnt include within the concept of polyamory for example couples who otherwise behave monogamously but sometimes go together to sex parties or swingers clubs and have sexual encounters with others in each others presence couples who have agreed that they can each have sexual encounters with other people but dont want these other encounters to develop into romantic relationships and have agreed rules to keep the relationships with others casual people who arent in a committed relationship at the moment and who date or plan to date several people in parallel explaining to each new date that they are also seeing and perhaps having sex with other people people who would prefer to be monogamous but who are in a relationship with someone who finds this difficult and have therefore agreed to allow them other relationships as long as they are honest ones
2757737 jeg har veldig mye gi til flere enn en men det er utrolig vanskelig finne noen som f ler det p samme m te som regel tenker folk bare sex utroskap men det er andre dimensjoner som bare er vanskelig forklare
2757738 jeg kan godt ha et fast forhold men om det er til en eller fler det tror jeg faktisk kan v re litt flytende muligheten til ha andre mer perifere partnere enten sammen eller hver for seg i tillegg er noe jeg f ler for lojaliteten for meg ligger i hjertet og hodet ikke mellom bena seksualiteten er viktig b de som et bindemiddel i kj rligheten men ogs for det generelle mentale og fysiske velv re knuge seksualiteten fast i en ekteskapskontrakt med veldig snevre rammer blir helt feil for meg

2757747 is an emotional entanglement between you and another woman it can never include me because its between two people and is a separate experience that puts the lie to everything weve gone through i cant manage my jealousy ive tried
2757748 yes she is selfish its a selfishness ive encouraged because it creates a workaround allowing me to have the sexual variety i crave and need not just my having sex with other women but her having sex with others too we avoid a lot of trouble by limiting our play to threesomes too theres no way she can feel threatened or left out if im making passionate love to her in the same bed

2757756 we need to follow state law but we also need to accomodate people who have been victims of crime

2757763 the dunk master can shove his dunking chair right up his arse i mean think about it its not even logical surely dunking my puny body into the stinky waters of lake effluence with its multitude of diseases shit and hamster eating pike cannot possibly prove that i am anything but an average hamster who firmly believes in the teachings of the wheel its so obvious that even a blithering moron could see it and anyone who thinks it isnt and can mount a reasonable counter argument can go stick their privates in the mangle sideways
2757764 and eloquent too but it will do you no good boy for if the fishy wishies dont eat you and your lungs do not give up their air too freely it will only condemn you then youll hang from the gallows for a week where the midges can feast gleefully upon your soft tissues

2757767 do your worst loathsome beast youll not better me i curse the wheel
2757768 young farnham is a witch after all es gone and made imself all eavy sos e can sink to the bottom and evade the justice of the wheel by wallowin in the ooze
2757769 the word is warlock and would you please refrain from dropping your aitches but i take your point drowning is an excellent means to save yourself from the gallows but itll do him no good whatsoever justice will prevail ill see to that
2757770 he might ave turned imself into a pike sos e can swim away and thumb is nose at us at a later date and probably from quite some distance too
2757771 i do believe we are witnessing a primitive form of law enforcement for surely it is not justice that we see practiced here
2757772 but should we sit and fret why aint ya doing something about it
2757773 do you really think so it would be ever so daring wouldnt it but might we not risk some dreadful wounding from the lawmens crossbows

2757785 an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage
2757786 the absolute condemnation of same sex relations of intimacy must rely either on an abstract fundamentalist deployment of a number of very ambiguous texts or on a problematic and non scriptural theory about natural complementarity applied narrowly and crudely to physical differentiation without regard to psychological structures

2757788 i dont see myself as a campaigner for a new morality

2757804 they were talking about deals investments and large sums of money then i realised they were civil servants discussing government policy
2757805 the two of them were having a wide ranging conversation they were talking about their career plans and their summer holidays but they were mainly talking about the government plans relating to the rising price of fuel
2757806 it was only as we drew into the station that it became clear exactly what the plan was
2757807 i heard him say he wants to give it to the ordinary people i think he was referring to gordon brown his colleague suggested the extra cash would go to the needy but he replied no a fuel rebate for everybody on child benefit
2757808 no decisions on any new measures have yet been taken
2757809 it has to be set lower than the amount currently paid to pensioners
2757810 but high enough that people will really notice the difference
2757811 traditional forms of respite care force older people into care homes we want to give families the right to make a different choice
2757812 pensioners to take holidays in british resorts with relatives who look after them presumably stopping the carers benefit and expect their full time 24 7 unpaid carer s to get jobs these people already receive extremely generous tax credits if they are low or medium paid that in some cases double their net income only a small minority really needs help but as usual the government refuses to target the help another 1bn down the drain and onto state borrowings i get child benefit for my 16 year old boys they laugh in the face of cold choosing to camp out in march and ghyll scramble we are able to afford our heating bills the government should target the money some children are poorly fed and clothed living in badly insulated homes because of course the average single professional who doesnt get any government handouts who is not allowed to get on keyworker or social housing lists to get cheap property to sell at a profit whose taxes pay for those that do dont have high fuel bills do they gordon laura roberts london united kingdom its very simple if youre single or without children fork out another 150 to those who do have them gordon brown as father christmas yet more socialist theft why not adjust the tax free allowance upwards to take low earners out of paying tax simple fair cheap to operate too simple for this meddling controlling government the administration costs of taking money away and giving it back must be huge beware the grey vote mr brown once again pensioners have been ignored presumably because we can still burn our furniture to keep warm and heat our food on a bbq the fact that the pension is already so low and is then taxed by this ridiculous government is bad enough bonkers whenever gordon looks for people to give money to it never seems to be me i just get the bills as a childless couple who only pay tax and receive absolutely no benefits i am supposed to pay the increased fuel bills that brown will tax to give to these single parents etc got to go now as me and my wife are going to keep warm by making babees and then we can sign on the dole yet another ill concieved bribe does he think we are stupid i will gladly take the 150 but i wont be voting labour again i object to families getting this kind of help where was the goverment when i was groing up with 4 boys in the house and both parents working about time people took responsability for themselves decide not to but the latest 356
2757813 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day

2757818 the high cost of fuel the higher cost of food could be affecting peoples disposable income people have less money to donate
2757819 a lot of our clientele are single parent families and seniors with fixed incomes
2757820 id imagine if the cost of food is going up the cost of transportation is going up that could definitely propel people into food bank reliance
2757821 fuel is a piece of food banks budgets in terms of trying to acquire and share the food and as transportation costs go up that is putting an additional squeeze on their resources that we havent seen in previous years
2757822 hunger is a significant issue in this country which is sad given the fact that we live in such a wealthy country
2757823 it really takes the effort of all of us the charitable community is there companies are there helping to support and we definitely need government support as well
2757824 hes never needed food but hes been laid off for some time
2757825 that was just two this week for me so if thats happening at our warehouse i imagine thats happening throughout the city

2757827 the focus of this inquest is to get a recommendation from the jury that in custody deaths should not be investigated by the police force involved in the death
2757828 there appeared to be an inordinate number of deaths in custody over the course of which the police didnt seem to be held accountable
2757829 complied with all appropriate policies procedures guidelines and statutory requirements for the arrest and treatment of persons taken into and released from custody and whether such policies procedures and guidelines are adequate

2757956 usually held in the states rome was chosen for this gathering because of the anniversary but also to facilitate attendance by a growing number of trained or interested healthcare professionals from europe
2757957 napro is the medical extension of the creighton model fertilitycare system a natural fertility awareness program has been running in the usa for almost forty years
2757958 presentations at the conference included case reports of the successful use of napro for a wide range of conditions
2757959 there is a profound depth to the ethos of napro which somehow reveals the truth of human life and the fertility cycle it is natural holistic and at the same time sacred
2757960 bringing naprotechnology to the uk is and will be an uphill struggle but one that will be worth fighting the desire to give life and the compassion that causes people to seek and work in the ivf industry are forces for good that have become twisted we are inadvertently allowing the destruction of thousands of embryos to give life to a few and this is morally ignorant at best and utilitarian at worst naprotechnology has the potential in this country to provide a realistic and successful alternative to most couples struggling to conceive and this is precisely where the battle must be fought
2757961 finally careful consideration should be given to the danger of this power passing into the hands of those public authorities who care little for the precepts of the moral law who will blame a government which in its attempt to resolve the problems affecting an entire country resorts to the same measures as are regarded as lawful by married people in the solution of a particular family difficulty who will prevent public authorities from favoring those contraceptive methods which they consider more effective should they regard this as necessary they may even impose their use on everyone it could well happen therefore that when people either individually or in family or social life experience the inherent difficulties of the divine law and are determined to avoid them they may give into the hands of public authorities the power to intervene in the most personal and intimate responsibility of husband and wife
2757962 lone professional moralist complains to fcc which issues a declaratory order against station station goes to court
2757963 if we want an improvement in radio the basic situation of broadcasting must be such that artists and thinkers have a place to work with freedom
2757964 depressing inability to appreciate that in our land of cultural pluralism there are many who think act and talk differently from the members of this court and who do not share their fragile sensibilities
2757965 we were founded on a very basic double standard this country was founded by slave owners who wanted to be free am i right a group of slave owners who wanted to be free so they killed a lot of white english people in order to continue owning their black african people so they could wipe out the rest of the red indian people and move west and steal the rest of the land from the brown mexican people giving them a place to take off and drop their nuclear weapons on the yellow japanese people you know what the motto of this country ought to be you give us a color well wipe it out
2757966 part of the reason is that the people who write about global warming for most newspapers and tv are not the same people as those who tend to cover weather in general the media is covering this as all sort of unconnected events just regular weather maybe gone a little wacky but in fact the scientific community has predicted for more than two decades now that as we pour more heat trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere the planet will heat up and that would redistribute water if you heat up the planet you evaporate more water and areas that are wetter will tend to see more intense rainfall and deluges and earlier snowmelts and all that will lead to flooding so what were seeing is exactly what scientists have been telling us would happen because of human emissions
2757967 not even a few weeks before this all happened we were in the middle of doing a climate change series thats going to run over the year we had two page graphic talking about the different things that would happen in iowa as a result of climate change and pointing out that you would expect more torrential rains what has happened here is consistent with many scientists view of what global warming will mean in the midwest
2757968 if a meteorologist cant speak to the fundamental science of climate change then maybe the ams american meteorological society shouldnt give them a seal of approval if a meteorologist has an ams seal of approval which is used to confer legitimacy to tv meteorologists then meteorologists have a responsibility to truly educate themselves on the science of global warming
2757969 weve got to have a national mission of converting our economy and the example for the world is solar energy 4 billion years of supply it is environmentally benign decentralized makes us energy independent and replaces the exxonmobil peabody coal uranium complex that is why we have got to go for economic political health and safety reasons

2757973 i found it hypocritical that in this town its all about lincoln we want to embrace him then you find out whoah this is who we are this is springfield
2757974 hijo de puta qui n fue el pelotudo que te puso moises
2757975 i actually think that we should explore nuclear power as part of the energy mix
2757976 the nuclear revival that we often hear about is not actually happening it is a very carefully fabricated illusion there are no buyers wall street is not putting a penny of private capital into the industry despite 100 plus percent subsidies
2757977 basically we can have as many nuclear plants as congress can force the taxpayers to pay for but you wont get any in a market economy
2757978 the first issue to come up for me would be the spread of nuclear weapons which it greatly facilitates if you look at places like iran and north korea how do you think theyre doing it iran claims to be making electricity vital to its development the technology materials equipment skills are applicable to both the president is absolutely right in identifying the spread of nuclear weapons as the gravest threat to our security so its really puzzling to me that hes trying to accelerate that spread every way he can think of its just an awful idea unless youre really interested in making bombs hes really triggered a new mideast arms race by trying to push nuclear power within the region
2757979 about as fat a terrorist target as you can imagine it is not necessary to fly a plane into a nuclear plant or storm a plant and take over a control room in order to cause that material to be largely released you can often do it from outside the site boundary with things the terrorists would have readily available
2757980 it stays dangerous for a very long time so you have to put it someplace that stays away from people and life and water for a very long time millions of years most likely so far all the places weve looked turned out to be geologically unsuitable including yucca mountain
2757981 one of the big reasons we have an oil problem and a climate problem today is we spent our money on the wrong stuff if we had spent it on efficiency and renewables those problems wouldve gone away and we wouldve made trillions of dollars profit on the deal because its so much cheaper to save energy than to supply it
2757982 senator obama unequivocally opposes giving retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies and has cosponsored senator dodds efforts to remove that provision from the fisa bill granting such immunity undermines the constitutional protections americans trust the congress to protect senator obama supports a filibuster of this bill and strongly urges others to do the same
2757983 wrong vote regrettable many democrats will do this we should be standing up for the constitution when sen obama is president he will im sure work to fix some of this but its going to be a lot easier to prevent it now than to try to fix it later
2757984 senator obama we are a proud group of your supporters who believe in your call for hope and a new kind of politics please reject the politics of fear on national security vote against this bill and lead other democrats to do the same
2757985 sometimes during campaigns the rhetoric gets overheated and amplified my core position has never changed ive always been a proponent of free trade
2757986 itll open doors for me personally if he becomes president
2757987 its a momentous thing to have a black president given americas history some people say its not a big deal but it is a very big deal the u s is a model for the world if people see a black man can be president of the u s maybe they will see me differently if hes special im special
2757988 hes almost talking about black nationalism hes very liberal hes very much a black politician whereas today hes a politician who happens to be black
2757989 i think thats a question for barack obama not me
2757990 theres more interest in the american election than in the lithuanian election which is right next door its a global election
2757991 its totally prohibited to give unlimited contributions to political parties its totally prohibited for a corporation or a union to just go right into its treasury and give money to political parties yet under an exemption that was created by the federal election commission which essentially is made up of representatives of the two major parties all of this money can be given if its given through a host committee under the pretense that its merely to promote the convention city
2757992 in return for this money the parties through the host committees offer access to top politicians to the president the future president vice president cabinet officials senators congressmen they promise these companies who are giving that they will be able to not only get close to these people by hosting receptions by access to vip areas but theyll actually have meetings with them
2757993 lavish conventions with million dollar podiums fancy skyboxes and broadway production teams are not necessary to the democratic process
2757994 congress should pass a law that says no more soft money for these conventions no corporate treasury union treasury no unlimited individual money instead the discard this host committee fiction can go out there and ask people to help the convention but with the same limits where theyre asking people to help them normally
2757995 were talking about the regime with the worst human rights record in the continent and the army with the worst human rights record in the continent with the greatest u s support including the contractors or mercenaries so the fact that this regime was involved in this liberation does not and should not and cannot cover up the fact that it is a horrendous regime
2757996 torture massacres disappearances and killings of noncombatants are widespread and collusion between the armed forces and paramilitary groups continues to this day in 2006 u s assistance to colombia amounted to an estimated 728 million approximately 80 percent of which was military and police assistance
2757997 supplied directly or through contractors troop transportation planning facilities and fuel to colombian military aircraft including the helicopter crew accused of dropping the bomb

2758007 so while it was a terrible mistake for the administration to rely on the erroneous intelligence about wmd and i mean it was catastrophic to our credibility first of all it was an honest error and not a lie but even if you correct it for that error what we found in iraq was a serious wmd threat even though saddam hussein had chosen to not maintain the stockpiles he had put himself in a position where he could have regenerated those stockpiles in three to five weeks
2758008 to prove that there is nothing is almost impossible i think that if we had been in iraq for a couple of months more it would have been enough to make it extremely clear to everybody that the chances were real that there were no weapons of mass destruction
2758009 i wish to heaven that they had listened a little better to what i had to say if they did listen
2758010 it is hard to avoid the impression that almost 20 years after the end of the cold war military calculations still dominate the long term thinking about major global relations terrorism is formally made the chief enemy but precautions are taken against the growing power of china and russia
2758011 the idea of giving enriched uranium to the saudis while threatening war with the iranians for enriching uranium is astonishing the idea that the saudis are going to somehow lower the price of oil on the basis of possibly getting nuclear reactors in the future is just almost staggering to think about
2758012 then i think its very likely that the chinese who have not ratified will follow if china does it maybe india does if india does pakistan does etc and the treaty would enter into force it would be a great thing if we outlawed any nuclear weapons tests in the future

2758018 i dont want to contribute anything to that industry i cant fault you for what youre doing i admire what you do but i cant feed that dragon think about dollars as bullets
2758019 the long memory is the most radical idea in america that long memory has been taken away from us you havent gotten it in your schools youre not getting it on your television youre being leapfrogged from one crisis to the next mass media contributed to that by taking the great movements that weve been through and trivializing important events no our peoples history is like one long river it flows down from way over there and everything that those people did and everything they lived flows down to me and i can reach down and take out what i need if i have the courage to go out and ask questions
2758020 the future i dont know through all of it up and down its the song its always been the song
2758021 hate breeds hate the united states said they were doing this to rout out terrorism who is engaged in terrorism now
2758022 im very happy to be in sudan but im very sad because of the situation of our brothers who remain in guantanamo conditions in guantanamo are very very bad and they get worse by the day our human condition our human dignity was violated and the american administration went beyond all human values all moral values all religious values in guantanamo you have animals that are called iguanas rats that are treated with more humanity but we have people from more than 50 countries that are completely deprived of all rights and privileges and they will not give them the rights that they give to animals
2758023 they hold the quran in contempt destroyed it several times and put their dirty feet on it they also sat on the quran while trying to get us angry they repeatedly committed violations against our dignity and our sexual organs
2758024 during these times the interrogations were all about al jazeera and alleged relations between al jazeera and al qaida they tried to induce him to spy on his colleagues at al jazeera
2758025 obama represents all the promise of america that a biracial man from a broken family can rise and have a strong shot of becoming our next president
2758026 im not endorsing anybody our country has elected white males from northern european countries going back now 230 or so years this finally represents that the top position in american government is really open to everyone and i think thats sending a powerful message not only to americans but throughout the world
2758027 in justice inside the scandal that rocked the bush administration
2758028 is when you send voter information to a group of people that you have reason to believe are no longer there such as military personnel who are overseas such as students at historically black colleges when it comes back as undeliverable the party uses that information to remove that person from the voter rolls claiming they are no longer there it is a reprehensible practice i had never heard of it until after i left office
2758029 i hope the media keeps shining the spotlight on groups like the american center for voting rights which has been engaging in this type of voter suppression action especially targeting the elderly people and minorities if you are an american citizen who is not a felon you have the right to vote i would just hope that in swing states like missouri wisconsin new mexico and a handful of other states that the democratic party and the media really keep a lot of pressure on this
2758030 our dominant media are ultimately accountable only to corporate boards whose mission is not life liberty and the pursuit of happiness for the whole body of our republic but the aggrandizement of corporate executives and shareholders
2758031 hes a mouthpiece for the largest media corporations and that kind of omnipotent power that these large networks have taking control of that and taking that power back from them is what this conference is about
2758032 rupert murdoch said the best thing that will come out of the iraq war will be oil at 20 a barrel now today when i came here i looked and it was 130 something when is rupert going to explain why the war didnt give us 20 a barrel oil
2758033 we are holding this demonstration because we are hungry we need to eat we need to work we are hungry thats all we are hungry
2758034 the specter of widespread hunger malnutrition and social unrest on an unprecedented scale
2758035 hunger is on the march here garbage is carefully sifted for whatever food might be left young babies wail in frustration seeking milk from a mother too anemic to produce it
2758036 burning food today so as to serve the mobility of the rich countries is a crime against humanity
2758037 the truth of the matter is its in our national interests that our farmers grow energy as opposed to us purchasing energy from parts of the world that are unstable or may not like us
2758038 is this a price blip no a food shortage not that either we are in a structural meltdown the direct result of three decades of neoliberal globalization we have allowed food to be transformed from something that nourishes people and provides them with secure livelihoods into a commodity for speculation and bargaining
2758039 the amount of speculative money in commodities futures was less than 5 billion in 2000 last year it ballooned to roughly 175 billion

2758049 jose is out for a little while maybe for a year those kind of injuries you dont know how youre going to come back hopefully he can pitch again
2758050 the worst part is it was very encouraging the way he was throwing the ball
2758051 it looked like he was back to where he needed to be he was healthy and his velocity was up and he had a good split
2758052 well continue to fight and its going to be interesting now weve got to look up theres one team in front of us
2758053 now hes confident hes attacking the zone it makes it a lot easier for us behind him

2758068 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
2758069 i know hes changed his stance on policy several times but thats just because hes such a maverick that he forges his own path and cant be held down by the big bad republican establishment

2758072 if you have access to their support web site there were some documents that explain how to generate a certificate however once the certificate is generated which i did on a fc3 stock box one needed to send the certificate to sipura for signing when i asked where to send it i was told to contact sales i have not done that yet but apparently there must be a charge to have that done since the support folks were referring me to sales
2758073 sipura uses a public key method to enable a secure call both devices need to be configured with a certificate signed by the same minica and the key negotiation is sent in proprietary sip info messages
2758074 the mini certificate contains a 512 bit rsa modulus n as the public key and a 1024 bit rsa modulus n is appended as the public key of the signing
2758075 we have now concluded successful interop testing between a snom 360 phone and an ingate firewall 1400 we ran srtp over the internet the ingate firewall transcoded it to unencrypted rtp and sent it to a cisco 7960 phone that to my knowledge dont support srtp
2758076 technically speaking srtp doesnt make sense without having a tls based signalling connection however the media is still secure even if srtp is used without tls the master key sent in the invite is not used as such but is instead used to generate the actual srtp encryption keys via aes these keys are then used to encrypt the rtp for a completely secure call srtp can be used in conjunction with a tls signalling connection

2758082 thats what im going to do im going to make all the right judgements as far as my health ive stressed that to them when i get out there im going to be running 100 miles per hour with no restrictions thats what im trying to accomplish
2758083 why wouldnt everybody want that for me i think everybody would be a lot happier when im 100 i know my quarterback would be i dont see why it would be a problem
2758084 i just want to get in good football shape and basically dont put myself through the things i went through last year
2758085 i told myself that i wasnt going to go out and do that because in the long run it just hurts me ive got to take care of myself and when im ready to go everybody will be the first people to know it
2758086 i dont think you guys will see him around here anymore
2758087 for myself i just want to get healthy im going to go out and do the things im capable of doing when i get healthy i think everybody out here will have a lot of appreciation for that when i get back on the football field
2758088 talking with me during the season while im off the field it wont make no difference to a guy like myself

2758136 thirty per cent of the industry is cash negative when gold is somewhere between us700 and us800 an ounce

2758138 weve got a brand new goldmine a new gold discovery a new plant and the companies whose assets havent lived up to expectations theyve been old and tired
2758139 i think the trend in stocks is up i do feel that july 15 represented the bottom for stocks and we are going to move higher
2758140 i really feel that what investors are looking for right here is signs that the economy is starting to pick up right now
2758141 although i was scheduled for the reserve i trained to be ready to fight through the entire tournament because the same thing happened to me two years ago in amsterdam when i went from the reserve to the final losing to bjorn bregy so my conditioning was good but still i was little nervous in the first fight it was nice having the crowd get behind me as i progressed through the tournament i feel like my team and i are the new hawaiians
2758142 i just opened with the jab and he went over
2758143 i normally knock people out with my right but i think i showed tonight that i can do it with my left as well im becoming a dangerous man im a little disappointed i couldnt show the fans more but i showed them a ko im satisfied because its a fight and the nicest things you can do in a fight our not get hurt and knock people out
2758144 but azizs right just kept coming in so quickly that i had to scrap the game plan and fight a brawl instead im glad i got the win
2758145 i dont think we are going to have a situation where the appellate tribunal will reach a decision after one or two sittings and given the busy schedules of the chairman and salman taseer the hearings could drag on beyond a month
2758146 it takes a lot of courage to get into position on bouncy wicket to be successful more than the technical its the mental side and i am sure indian batsmen are aware of it
2758147 i have put together a document on touring australia it is how to go about doing it there is a definite style of playing technically on bouncy wickets
2758148 at waca its a very tough cricketing environment there is never an easy game and its mentally very demanding but the australians also say its the best place to bat one needs to brace the challenge and give everything you have got
2758149 i guess its a case of looking at the glass that is half full and not half vacant
2758150 its a mental battle when you come to australia you could be sure they would leave no stone unturned it tests you as a person yes you got to have skills but it you can go by skill only up to a point
2758151 you need to have a strong character in australia you are fully examined
2758152 they are two cricket mad countries there is a lot of emotion flying around lot of intensity
2758153 sometimes under pressure you can make wrong choices however it is brave to stand up and accept it at the end of the day its the players who can sort this issue out they are the custodians of the game which is bigger than team individuals
2758154 i do feel there are specialist positions sehwag has just hit a big hundred and has the respect of the australians rahul dravid on the other hand has been hugely successful as a middle order batsman
2758155 the cynicism that the american people feel towards politicians and politics
2758156 i know when i was given out in the first innings in sydney i should have left straight away instead of hanging around for a few seconds and i know i should not have lobbed my bat into the dressing room
2758157 michael clarke also knows that he should have gone straight away too after cutting the ball to first slip
2758158 he knows he did the wrong thing but at the time he was just shocked at how he had got out first ball
2758159 i believe there are no glaring issues we need to address but when they are all added together in the heat of such a tense and dramatic final day they caused a reaction so we need to tighten up on how we play
2758160 we are very keen to ensure we get the balance of how we play the game right so we can focus clearly on another very big match coming up
2758161 my overall emotion and feeling at the end of the game was as good a feeling as ive ever had on a cricket field
2758162 winning a test like that coming down to the last eight or ten minutes on the fifth day any test you win then is going to be pretty special for us to be able to do it after a 70 run deficit in the first innings and probably not play our best until the second innings makes this win as good as any that ive played
2758163 he actually said to me when i gave him the ball ive got about just enough time to win us the game here hes always had a fair bit of confidence in himself
2758164 the last 30 or 40 minutes were about gambling about rolling the dice
2758165 i tried most guys there in that last hour and a half i had to do that just to see who the batsmen would find the hardest to play at that time it looked like the faster bowlers were easier to play than the spinners
2758166 i didnt know exactly what was the right amount of runs and the right amount of overs i was conscious not to set anything that was going to be too easy for the indians to chase
2758167 after the initial heat of the moment when emotions were running high we decided we would wait ad see what exactly the statement from the match referee was
2758168 nothing has been communicated to us yet but if a ban is imposed we will appeal against it within 24 hours harbhajan will appeal and the bcci will also appeal
2758169 there was no evidence against harbhajan so i dont know how they could arrive at such a conclusion
2758170 we are extremely disappointed since we feel that there is no evidence against harbhajan
2758171 such infrastructure may perversely perpetuate the oil vulnerability of australias outer suburban regions at great cost
2758172 such schemes will largely direct new investment to central and middle suburban areas yet these are the zones that are already well served by high quality public transport infrastructure as reflected in the high use of these services by residents
2758173 it is time for action now the state government needs to start building railway extensions into growth corridors and ease the financial strain on people living in the outer suburbs
2758174 i am really excited at the moment and hope i do the baggy green proud
2758175 you couldnt script it better to play in front of your home crowd and that is something you will always remember i probably thought maybe i had missed the boat but also i thought there could be an opportunity
2758176 you never want to wish an injury on anyone but there is always a chance that might happen it is unlucky for matt and i feel for him but it is a great opportunity for me
2758177 i was very impressed with what i saw that day and this is his opportunity theres no doubt about that
2758178 obviously i am very disappointed missing this test match it is going to be a really special
2758179 adapter intel r pro 100 ve network connection adapter link down
2758180 it is a very big call to accuse someone on suspicion only
2758181 so unless people have been caught and disqualified i think it is very unfair to the clean competitors
2758182 i believe that once you have used before you would never go back to being clean those athletes who have been banned should not be competing
2758183 i think there is more likelihood of people keeping an eye out for you security and volunteers if you are in gear
2758184 if we can stop the signal for the proliferation of uncontrolled growth of the cells then we can stop the leukemia in its tracks
2758185 normally in drug design it would be 15 years from start to finish but because of the nature of the surface we have to split apart the way ahead is antibodies and that is very straightforward technology
2758186 so i would expect the drug development would be a lot faster
2758187 not only is this a very important protein involved in disease the structure shows immediately how we can design drugs to treat the disease

2758287 the greatest miracle of all that day was having that many people together in faith to see what god had for us
2758288 i am still in awe of that and honored by it
2758289 the humanness inside of you wants to ask why me but i also knew i had to accept that calling
2758290 we were told through the messengers the three parishioners there would be 20 000 there
2758291 we received specific instructions what to prepare in terms of aid stations water stations stations to serve people in need we were given specific instructions on all of the things
2758292 we had a couple of parishioners on nbc for an interview on national television and they were asked why lubbock
2758293 their answer was why not lubbock a few months afterward texas monthly magazine said there were reports of miracles but they said the miracle was getting 20 000 people to lubbock
2758294 this isnt enough to wash away the curious but i had to chuckle it was just kind of a sign
2758295 a little while later around 7 30 or 8 is when all kinds of things started to happen we saw it and everyone out there got very excited we saw the sun coming down out of the sky it was a real manifestation of god thats the only way i can explain it
2758296 and that caused him to have his hand against his chest he was unable to open his arm out when the blessed mother came to the fountain at st john neumann he extended out his hand
2758297 the biggest catholic event in the history of the diocese didnt happen
2758298 the only thing were saying is it doesnt take a miracle it doesnt take a suspension of the laws of nature to explain these good things that have happened at st john neumann
2758299 miracles would be a very rare sort of thing the catholic church would recognize
2758300 the team of experts that we brought in felt it was not a miracle but rather sincere people overstating their spiritual experience there was no sign of miraculous intervention
2758301 ultimately they said no miracle occurred i remember we met with the panel all the messengers were there i was there before the investigation started the bishop asked me where is your miracle the way i define a miracle is it is an awesome event that brings people to god

2758307 as of today most of the city tskhinvali is controlled by russian peacekeeping forces
2758308 we deplore the dangerous and disproportionate actions by russian forces and we would be particularly troubled if these attacks are continuing now as the georgians are pulling back
2758309 the georgian tanks fired at everything they saw including women and children

2758327 we were very close to being in the quarterfinals and now we are very far
2758328 before the game nobody gave us a chance and i think we played pretty good you can look at his as half empty or half full
2758329 in the dying seconds well maybe not the dying seconds to get a goal for 2 2 were not a real team were still a lot of individual players
2758330 the sotto law also known as the press freedom law is aimed precisely to protect press freedom and keep irate politicians from intimidating journalists and their sources if they do not like what they read
2758331 protection of confidential sources of information is also an obligation for journalists and key to getting informants to come forward
2758332 this is particularly important in uncovering among others corruption in government
2758333 if the press freedom law is repealed or weakened sources would be deterred from coming forward and the public would remain uninformed about vital matters
2758334 the fact that these shameful actions are being initiated by senators who should know that protection of journalists sources is an essential part of press freedom makes it even more reprehensible

2758364 our passion let us down there were too many good players that didnt play well today
2758365 iraq and china are keen to show their cooperation by finalizing an agreement on developing the ahdab oil field
2758366 after our midweek disappointment it was always going to be a tough game for us today and thats the way it turned out
2758367 were just pleased we managed to go on and win it
2758368 with the week that weve had it was one of those that you felt might have gone against us but it didnt and credit to allan for making the save
2758369 we went on to get the winner after that and we were pleased about that we managed to get the win and that was the most important thing for us
2758370 the biggest problem we have is that we have built up a reputation over the last 18 months and it got ruined in two games
2758371 their attitude and determination to play was something we have not had to question over the 18 months ive been the manager
2758372 we lost very poor goals and thats what cost us the game
2758373 if we can tighten up a bit and be a bit more decisive when the ball can be cleared then well win more matches
2758374 were not going to accept the type of defending when we lost the goals but generally the commitment fitness play and creativity was there
2758375 i think we lost them at a stage in the first half when we were dominating the game we looked the most likely team we were the most creative team
2758376 for the away team we had most of the possession in hearts last two thirds
2758377 but weve cost ourselves the game by losing two poor goals
2758378 we did expect to win we do expect to win i think we should have won this game
2758379 its a good result for them because im still convinced at this moment in time that were better than hearts
2758380 clearly theyve got a manager who has galvanised them and theyre going to be a decent team this season
2758381 but i would like to play them again next week and i would still take my team against them
2758382 i felt we had the game under control and we did all the attacking
2758383 we were down to 10 men because david van zanten needed stiches and lazy defending from midfielders saw us go 1 0 down i wont tolerate that
2758384 we should have scored a couple of goals but we blunt in front of goal
2758385 its all ifs and buts but when you get chances like that you must bury them
2758386 maybe he froze a little bit but he should have punished them
2758387 if you look at positives we were on the front foot for most of the match
2758388 their spirit was what i needed and this was very entertaining
2758389 all the time football is a wonderful game and win lose or maybe you make a draw but congratulations to motherwell a fantastic team a very good team
2758390 but congratulations to my team i have been here four weeks and i think this is the best game i have seen
2758391 i am for passion and for fighting i was eight times operated on one knee but i stand up all the time and came back to professional football
2758392 if the player sees a coach who is positive his body language is positive
2758393 also you must be strong and you must have discipline i think today there was not only a game from the fighting and the spirit we played very good football some of the time
2758394 in the end we won 3 2 and i hope we can enjoy these three points
2758395 i thought team spirit and teamwork won us the game today
2758396 we competed really well and looked dangerous on the break
2758397 i was confident in my players and what theyve done over the last six weeks so that performance just confirmed that
2758398 when you score goals at any level i always believe you can score at the top level
2758399 andrew wants to do well for himself and he wants to do well for the team im excited about seeing him develop in the next three years
2758400 i thought it was a cracking game both teams were going hammer and tongs at each other
2758401 we got the goal through a great strike from jamie hamill but it could have been 2 2 or 3 3 and people would have been raving about the game
2758402 hes a couple of weeks behind in terms of fitness and i was going to take him off with 20 minutes to go
2758403 he was pumped up for his debut and maybe a bit rash for his booking but he will get better and better
2758404 the lad has got great pace and strength and chases and works hard for team
2758405 for me two words sum it up belief and conviction we played some good stuff but we just need to believe we can go and score goals
2758406 the players have to believe me when i tell them theyre good enough although i felt my boys were outstanding they passed the ball really well
2758407 once rangers scored we went chasing it a bit we always seem to come back on ourselves
2758408 watching it as a coach i can make it better i know that the players have to believe me
2758409 ive read goldilocks and the three bears for 25 years im only passing on that wisdom to them were at out best when were playing expansive football
2758410 big higgie was confident we told him to put it straight down the middle and he needed to hit it with a bit more conviction
2758411 its the final third goals have to come from all over the place you just cant rely on the strikers
2758412 its just disappointing that the boys put so much into the game and never got anything out it

2758442 i have no voice because ive been screaming too much in celebration
2758443 i was obviously in top form but something like this cannot be planned
2758444 we were very close to being in the quarterfinals and now we are very far
2758445 before the game nobody gave us a chance and i think we played pretty good you can look at his as half empty or half full
2758446 when i scored that goal we went and picked it up
2758447 when i came in they said they werent sure and so i said ill take it
2758448 you just blast it on goal and see where it lands
2758449 if you look at the replay it goes right under the wall
2758450 unfortunately we were the better team for 70 minutes we let two points get away from us
2758451 since i came here ive had four opening games to the season and thats the least effective and least enjoyable i thought everything was low key today the crowd performance everything but at the end of the season it might be an important result
2758452 the st mirren players were outstanding from start to finish thats all i want to speak about as the referee decided it was a penalty and there is nothing we can do about it
2758453 we were well in the game had a good shape passed the ball well had some good chances and some half chances and we hit the post if we had received the break celtic got then we could have taken something from the game

2758476 some of the most sensitive counterterrorism operations in the government
2758477 were deeply flawed sloppily reasoned overbroad and incautious in asserting extraordinary constitutional authorities on behalf of the president
2758478 the president has already decided that terrorists do not receive geneva convention protections he barked
2758479 this sting has rendered tehelka as the investigative wing of the congress
2758480 definitely the sting operation and its content are suspect because we are aware for sometime that there are detractors against modi in gujarat and there is the congress party which has lost all ground in the state
2758481 i was not surprised when the political establishment scrambled to look for conspiracies the cia was behind it the isi sponsored tehelka my point then as now was simple enough let us first deal with the revelations and then worry about taruns so called backers

2758491 when an arm of the government of india honours the film while another arm harasses the film maker and then bans the film it makes the indian state appear schizophrenic i hope the government will do away with censorship for documentaries especially in view of its stated commitment to right to information as well as freedom of expression documentaries should instead be brought under the purview of the press council of india after all what is the difference between an ndtv special report on gujarat riots and final solution a ban on final solution seems absurd police action to prevent screenings of documentaries seems totally farcical there is no space for such censorship in a mature democracy i urge sections of civil society to join us in our campaign against censorship of documentaries

2758582 the internal discord over whether to attack obama led some of her own staff to spin reporters to try to downplay the significance of her criticisms the result for clinton was the worst of both worlds the conflicting message exacerbated her reputation for negativity without affording her whatever benefits a sustained attack might have yielded

2758594 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2758595 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2758596 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2758597 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2758598 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2758599 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2758600 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2758648 i understand why legislators want to give people a break because the economy is down and people are hurting and cant afford the things they want to buy
2758649 but they arent taking into account what that revenue could later buy for the states

2758656 um kinda see its mostly a horror story about a guy getting revenge but seeing as how he has to figure out who to get revenge upon he has to solve the mystery of who killed his buddy its not the central premise of the story but it is a mystery and you know after two weeks of stories that are obviously mysteries i wanted to go for something a little askew something a little more messy a little less certain something that borrows mystery elements so we can see that genre mixing is fun also i didnt want another story set in gotham after last week and i wasnt in the mood to go hunting for ed brubakers point blank so lets look at this book and see how a story with the bare minimum of a mystery nonetheless holds up to raymond chandlers ghostly scrutiny also using the first arc from desolation jones would have been a bit obvious and i wanted to have a laugh

2758673 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2758674 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2758675 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2758676 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2758677 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2758678 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2758679 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2758680 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2758681 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2758682 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2758683 its been covered in the books and video games and comic books which are things i think are incredibly creative but that i dont really have anything to do with other than being the person who built the sandbox theyre playing in
2758684 the movies were the story of anakin skywalker and luke skywalker and when luke saves the galaxy and redeems his father thats where that story ends
2758685 the clone wars is a lot of fun for me because in the normal course of the skywalker saga what happened during the clone wars is never told we see a little of the beginning and a little of the end but other than that its skipped over
2758686 it was quite a moving experience watching you sing that song

2758696 our goal is to be proficient with them before the super bowl
2758697 you can see detail but its not a naked picture
2758698 trying to explain the truth of the soul to them would be like trying to explain polymer chemistry to a fifteenth century alchemist or etiquette to the average high school loudmouth jerk there is simply too much prerequisite knowledge to make up for there is also a problem of disposition in my experience the best spoken theists understand best atheist arguments very well and present them carefully and faithfully but i have never met an atheist who understood the best theist arguments carefully and correctly never if you have the calling to speak to the dawkins crowd you must answer the call but remember that the full truth is always revealed only to relatively few who seek truth and wisdom faithfully and as disciples of the great masters the dawkinses have always been with us five years from now they will be replaced by some new fad that feeds on death they are nothing more or less than the world which is already passing away at times it seems clear that they dont even want to refute other arguments they just want to suck people into an argument that itself will drag everyone down to death they want us to speak like them at one time ironic condescending and spiteful and at another time with a false modesty that feeds on ignorance tepidity sloth and death

2758720 i thought st mirren players were outstanding from the first minute to the last and thats all i will talk about
2758721 the referee was winking at me he would need to explain why i dont know whether he was trying to irritate me or not i dont know but hell deny it
2758722 its so so difficult to say what you really feel weve seen it go on a number of times now and youve just got to bite your tongue
2758723 its not going to change anything we lost the game 1 0 and it was out of our control and theres nothing we can do about it
2758724 i actually havent seen the incident yet but what ive been told by people whom i trust and respect it was offside and then a free kick for us
2758725 from what ive heard there is contact on haining from vennegoor of hesselink
2758726 but eddie smith wont change his mind he and his observer thought they got it right last season and thats worrying
2758727 its irrelevant to ask if the penalty would have been given for us at the other end it doesnt matter its been given and we get on with it
2758728 was it a free kick was he offside there are a lot of questions to be answered but theres no point in asking the questions we wont get the answers
2758729 when you hear of a referees meeting with spl managers up on screens then you maybe think you will become a target
2758730 i was one of them i dont know the context but i would be concerned if we are talking about or targeting individual managers its dangerous
2758731 i thought it was a penalty and i thought we could have had one before that but there you go some you get some you dont
2758732 the whole game was low key and we only had four good players
2758733 before people start exaggerating his fee it was 400 000
2758734 hopefully he will bring passing ability and imagination and a bit of zest

2758740 we would have taken quaresma and saviola but the players decided not to come
2758741 we have always thought that this formula could be successful so we have looked at crosas
2758742 we are not finally there but that deal is now a structure which will hopefully allow us to add players going forward
2758743 hopefully it makes a lot of sense not only with barcelona but with other clubs too
2758744 a young or fringe barcelona player could come here play in our first team play in front of 60 000 and in europe and develop as a player both clubs could benefit from that

2758761 i saw his body was wide open so as id hurt him with the same punch early on so i went for it
2758762 this was a mature performance from a youngster in his first major tournament in fact i would say he is even a bit more mature than amir was at this stage hes a tough kid he can box fight and is very adaptable
2758763 it was tough last time but this will be harder

2758921 we had to devise a system that would involve intels technology as an integral part of the technology used in the transfer and edit process
2758922 the only way to achieve the video would be to shoot on a hd format in order to be able to transfer scenes as we shot an editor was on set to be able to piece the video together as we went nevertheless i wanted to have a very cinematic look for the video so richard mott my dop recommended the red camera with cook 35mm prime lenses to achieve that look
2758923 barry wasserman 1st ad on the shoot asked if we could afford to lose any shots i told him that would just leave holes in the video
2758924 but we decided to shoot the whole thing on a steadicam which turned out to be a very good move

2758932 im on a much higher skill level than he is
2758933 and after beating judah i want to go into the ring again against margarito
2758934 i pounded on him then hurt my right hand then my left
2758935 i was hurt but i refused to quit i went the full 12 rounds
2758936 i am happy my team won and that the fight will be staged in germany
2758937 berlin is very special to me that is where i defeated ruiz in 2005 to become world champion fighting in the max schmeling halle again will be like a home match
2758938 he has gone through the full preparation twice and can t wait to get back into the ring
2758939 nikolai has improved a lot under the guidance of his new coach alexander zimin
2758940 hopefully that will result in a plan if he wants to go with the de la hoya fight ill contact richard schaefer and will start that negotiations
2758941 its gonna take maybe a week or so but theres no reason for undue haste its a very important decision for mannys career a lot of money involved and were gonna go slowly
2758942 its an honor to fight a legend like de la hoya if this fight pushes through i will give my very best in preparing for this fight
2758943 i believe freddie when he said i can beat de la hoya

2758962 what is less well known is that the words of the declaration arent entirely jeffersons george masons recently published draft of the
2758963 pursuit of happiness may be argued to be a succinct improvement on pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety but even that
2758964 congress did not hesitate to alter jeffersons painstakingly crafted words altogether it ordered forty changes to the original text it deleted 630 words about a quarter of the total and added 146
2758965 muir weaves commentary thoughtful analyses and humor into a true art form
2758966 muirs genius lies in his giving context to the films
2758967 as a critic muir is acute in his analysis and as a writer he is easy to read
2758968 well grounded in the love and minutiae of sci fi and fantasy adventure
2758969 john kenneth muirs books for mcfarland are distinctive because of their authority and effective research
2758970 he really scrapes beneath the surface of the film and looks for the subtext every nuance is analysed
2758971 an independent film scholar muir explains film studies concepts in a language that is reader friendly and engaging
2758972 john kenneth muir must have had one mis spent youth
2758973 i have read quite a bit of horror film criticism and analysis in my day and john muir is one of the very best if not the best i have ever encountered
2758974 a good 18 steps above the usual dubious faux scholar blogger he takes enormous time and effort analysing unmercifully yet attuned to heretofore dismissed value every release he turns his attention to
2758975 it is definitely out of character it must be some sort of mistake or perhaps the computer was used by someone else
2758976 we are quite surprised and we are all quite horrified by it
2758977 our argument is that the fixed costs people face in terms of rent and utilities makes that quite inequitable
2758978 it needs to move from the current 59 per cent to 66 per cent of the couples rate
2758979 that represents a 30 a week increase it would cost about 1 billion
2758980 this review will address the adequacy of social welfare payments including the age pension so we get it right for older australians who have helped build this nation
2758981 i caught sight of its face and it looked like a pot bellied pig
2758982 it then pulled itself onto the slipway and seemed to be foraging for something after a short while it sauntered into the water and that was the last i saw of it
2758983 it was several times larger than that dog more like the size of a small cow
2758984 we do after all get tropical sea beans and the occasional coconut washed up as well as sea turtles from the caribbean so why not a manatee if it is a manatee i think it could be a first for uk waters
2758985 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2758986 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2758987 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2758988 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

2758993 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2758994 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2758995 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

2758997 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2758998 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2758999 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2759000 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2759001 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2759002 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2759003 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2759004 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2759005 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2759006 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2759007 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2759008 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2759009 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2759010 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2759011 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2759012 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2759013 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2759014 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2759015 rezultatele sunt importante pentru a stabili rolul pe care l joac b utura de exemplu n raporturile sexuale neprotejate
2759016 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2759017 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2759018 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2759019 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2759020 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2759021 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2759022 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2759023 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2759024 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2759025 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2759026 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2759027 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2759028 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2759029 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2759030 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2759031 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2759032 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2759033 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2759034 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2759035 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2759036 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2759037 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2759038 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2759039 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2759040 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2759041 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2759042 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2759043 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2759044 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2759045 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2759046 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2759047 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2759048 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2759049 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2759050 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

2759053 rielle hunter was a private individual who is not running for public office and she wanted to maintain her privacy
2759054 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2759055 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2759056 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well

2759061 the leading important factor for asean to continue to achieve successes in the new stage is that the association should promote concerted efforts to ensure a peaceful stable and co operative environment in the region on the basis of the goals and basic principles set by asean in the treaty of amity and co operation tac and the asean charter
2759062 member countries should continue to do their utmost to strengthen the associations unity increase friendship and the sense of community promote co operation and solve all differences by peaceful measures
2759063 meanwhile asean should continue to play a leading role in regional matters actively accelerate the process of negotiation and co operation in the region create opportunities for external partners to take part in and contribute to handling challenges to peace security and development in southeast asia and the asia pacific region
2759064 this requires each member country to make a strong political commitment to the asean linkage process and the asean family further harmonising national interests with that of the whole asean region for a common goal of the association
2759065 asean should take practical measures to quickly narrow the existing development gap between its member countries particularly between the old and new members through the efficient implementation of the asean linkage initiatives
2759066 the charter will bring about a reform in the organisation apparatus and mode of operation of the association helping improve the quality and efficiency of co operation between member countries
2759067 viet nam is an organic part of asean and holds a sense of responsibility to the asean family southeast asia and asean are of strategic significance to viet nam as they directly relate to viet nams security and development a tightly linked and united asean has an important international role and its position is completely in line with viet nams basic and long term interests
2759068 therefore we always view asean in both multilateral and bilateral co operation as an important part of our foreign policy of independence self reliance multilateralism diversification and neighbourly friendship
2759069 in return viet nam has gained numerous fruitful and practical benefits from the countrys asean experiences in favour of the goals for national security and development as well as increasing the countrys international prestige
2759070 asean has always had an important position in viet nams external policy which calls for independence self determination diversification and international and regional integration
2759071 we should be more active take initiative and bear greater responsibility in relations with asean
2759072 the fact shows that asean is a regional co operation organisation full of vitality and adaptable to changes in the world situation
2759073 that is the result of the regional co operation over the past four decades and member countries common vision and strong political determination in line with the associations sound decisions and road map
2759074 the asean charter will bring in a remarkable change in the associations organisational apparatus and mode of operation helping improve the quality and effectiveness of asean co operation

2759159 summer is an excellent time for men and women of all ages to take advantage of the many health benefits of swimming nail care unfortunately many are embarrassed by the appearance of their dry heels or discolored toenail cares causing them to avoid activities such as swimming water aerobics or even experience the cooling freedom of wearing sandals or flip flops
2759160 regardless of what shape you re in there s no time like summer to make a commitment to eating right exercising and sprucing up your appearance
2759161 feet and legs are on display nail careduring the warmer months and are a age give away if not pampered a bit and tended to

2759170 this isnt the first time this has happened and it doesnt surprise me anymore
2759171 politics takes precedence over sport with the iranians and the olympic spirit is as far from them as east is far from west
2759172 my heart goes out to the iranian athletes in the athens olympics one of their sportsmen who was a gold medal favorite had to pull out because he was drawn against an israeli
2759173 theres no place for this kind of behavior in the olympic movement and its a shame it continues
2759174 its just a happy day i dont even have the words to describe how happy i am
2759175 this is another amazing step for me in celebrating being an american seeing my fellow americans coming behind me and supporting me will be a great honor the highest honor

2759178 hold onto your hats its going to be a bumpy ride
2759179 there are seemingly limitless combinations with regard to the moves that can be made you have to use your intelligence to play devise a strategy and map out tactics there are many things the game can teach you
2759180 chess is a game that all ages can enjoy and be engaged in
2759181 people of different ages can play together and have an equally challenging and enjoyable experience
2759182 people in the club thought we should do something on fatv to help promote chess promote what the club does and finally we did something
2759183 at first we did programs about the game itself such as what the pieces are how they are moved those types of things
2759184 and the overhead shot really didnt work because everything was flattened out the pieces were indistinguishable
2759185 i think weve finally found the format that works for us
2759186 something that is in the range of 25 to 30 moves
2759187 because we only have a half hour show and time is very important
2759188 because you could have someone who is young and who is very good at playing chess
2759189 there has always been a great deal of interest in the game in this area and the wachusett chess club remains a very strong club
2759190 there was a time when chess was really growing in interest in this country
2759191 and fitchburg was one of the places to be if you were a chess player
2759192 he played 55 matches played white throughout lost 5 won 48 and had a draw in two
2759193 and from all walks of life from retired professors to teachers to lawyers to students the ages of our members range from 13 on up
2759194 but as they grow up there are competing interests and they get pulled away from it which is a shame because chess can really add so much to a persons life
2759195 during the time of bobby fischer many people were interested in chess because of bobby fischer just the strength of his personality
2759196 this country does not have a tradition of chess such as they do in europe or in the former soviet union where everyone either grew up playing the game or watched others play the game then bobby fischer comes along bobby fischer drew the spotlight to bobby fischer but also the sport of chess
2759197 and there was something about him the way he played the way he pursued the game that captivated this country and drew people to it
2759198 you can make a mistake and get caught in a submission but chuck made a mistake and he got caught in an ass whoopin
2759199 gal hirsh and israel ziv are mainly training and consulting georgian arm units
2759200 to every israeli agent representing an israeli defense company is attached a cousin of the defense minister who opens the doors for him
2759201 the israeli military industries upgraded in recent years the georgian air force sold unmanned aerial vehicles uav advanced artillery systems and trained infantry units
2759202 no ser la cima pero es hasta donde un simpson puede llegar
2759203 it doesnt feel like a win because we should be doing better than that
2759204 we could have had one five minutes before and we didnt bother appealing because it was sucking the life out of us on the bench that game
2759205 dio morto marx morto e anchio oggi non mi sento molto bene
2759206 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2759207 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2759208 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2759209 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2759210 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2759211 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2759212 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2759213 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2759219 i thought this was going to have to be a fast 200
2759220 afterwards i looked up and saw president bush giving me a thumbs up and holding up the american flag that was pretty cool
2759221 there are a lot of middle aged women and men who tell me that i am an inspiration to them and that they are doing things that they never thought they would do
2759222 the piece can be dismissed as a conspiracy theory of my cynical mind

2759230 to set a fire you have to set a fire
2759231 let me lock you up in the bathroom for two years see what youd do
2759232 mr rupp caused a tremendous amount of hurt and pain to people by his actions
2759233 showed that he was the type of person who was not going to learn from his mistakes a prison sentence was appropriate
2759234 have to be harsh enough for people to pay attention
2759235 how could they pull a jury out of these people
2759236 they were all mad as hell at me because i burned their homes down
2759237 when you hear prison you think of really horrific things like violent crimes
2759238 i dont know him personally i just know he turned my life upside down
2759239 forest fires are a fact of life up here you just dont go out and mow the weeds when its 106 degrees

2759245 when i started in the clubs i had to work places where didnt nobody else want to work
2759246 i had to do clubs where street gangs were had to do motorcycle gangs gay balls and things of that nature
2759247 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
2759248 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
2759249 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
2759250 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries
2759251 she wishes to maintain her privacy and her daughters privacy
2759252 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2759253 i know that its not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events
2759254 i wish that those involved would refrain from bad mouthing my sister
2759255 she is a good and honest person the sweetest and most caring woman one could ever hope to meet
2759256 do you think its easy for us to just sit back and let everyone rip her to shreds and not defend her honor
2759257 it could well be it looks like me i dont know who that baby is i have no idea what the picture is
2759258 i mean do you know how many pictures have been taken of me holding children in the last three years i mean it happens all the time

2759260 i like them because they go to sleep at 5 and wake up at 10 they sleep they eat then they sleep some more

2759262 so its a busy time we get calls from all over the state from people who either want tortoises or want to get rid of tortoises
2759263 the wilfongs are definitely doing good work tortoises are such long lived animals its very very difficult to find good long term homes for them
2759264 they also know a tremendous amount about tortoises and well call them with questions sometimes theyve taken in countless tortoises that people have dumped here
2759265 tortoises are personable theyre peaceful and the police wont bring em home after stealing the neighbors car
2759266 by raising and breeding them we stop them from being taken from the wild
2759267 tortoises are losing habitat all over the world the few places they can still live in the wild they should be left there
2759268 you bring out a shovel and start digging your own hole and theyll all stop what theyre doing and come watch theyre very curious
2759269 theyll take any animal i bring to them literally and theyll know exactly what to do

2759271 in san francisco we run the risk of losing the entire black population
2759272 there should be emergency hearings because this is an emergency
2759273 african americans in san francisco lag behind the rest of the city in almost every key economic indicator and face significant barriers to addressing the disparities
2759274 we could paper the walls of this building with reports that have been made on this issue
2759275 this is a city that still has a problem with discrimination and many of the things we are talking about are the result of discrimination
2759276 every organization that has anything to do with eliminating discrimination has been underfunded understaffed and underrecognized
2759277 while gavin newsom vacations in africa our families are being evicted going hungry and are unemployed
2759278 we need a real response developer driven policy in san francisco is killing my people
2759279 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on cease fire and termination of hostilities
2759280 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2759281 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2759282 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2759283 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2759284 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2759285 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2759286 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia
2759287 i would hate to see our teachers and classrooms lose out on money because the state doesnt have enough revenue
2759288 i understand why legislators want to give people a break because the economy is down and people are hurting and cant afford the things they want to buy
2759289 but they arent taking into account what that revenue could later buy for the states
2759290 weve given them the benefit of the doubt for a long time
2759291 a sales tax free weekend will be welcomed more than ever in this tough economy especially with the high prices of food and fuel
2759292 it is certainly worth it when you consider the positive impact on retail sales and consumer confidence
2759293 theres just something about a sales tax holiday thats different from a regular sale
2759294 there are a lot of families out there struggling to make ends meet and theyre having to stretch their dollars
2759295 while the 5 percent or so savings doesnt sound like a lot that could be a make or break
2759296 its the same sort of family that collects coupons for the grocery store that waits for tax holidays to shop
2759297 you already have an awesome blog in the form of

2759323 perhaps if he had taken a look around once in a while at all the good people who were helping him up he might have realized that he didnt get where he was all alone then perhaps he wouldnt have felt so much like superman
2759324 a resident in the south blount utility district said they got a notice of violation of safe drinking water standards indicating their drinking water was contaminated with high levels of lead
2759325 it was a touching moment and a lovely display of republican family values cindy blushed of course and looked flattered you could almost see her already measuring the thongs she will wear in the white house
2759326 the very sad thing is there are people that one wouldnt readily categorize as being racist in any other situation that do feel that obama being president would
2759327 one thing about davis he has consistently blamed democrats for all the national and regional ills and now he blames them for not being re elected
2759328 taking a stand against chinas big redemptive pr show by declining to attend wouldve been consistent and coherent but complaining all the way to the show and even at his reception in china this morning smacks of incoherency bad manners and outright hypocrisy
2759329 katie allison granju signed off for the last time at knoxville talks yesterday she did a fantastic job creating a great new local media sponsored blog and set the bar high for her successor

2759342 the piece discusses the increased interest in bicycling that has accompanied higher gasoline prices i have noticed more people riding on the roads this summer unfortunately a few of them appear to have not yet mastered safety rules on riding with traffic
2759343 i have trouble understanding the separation between the roane alliance a county government function supported by our tax dollars and the chamber of commerce
2759344 todays message is simple all the gobs have to do is wait long enough and the voters of this county will forget whatever transgressions may have angered them in the past
2759345 to shield itself from public accountability the white house crafted rules which ignored centuries of legal precedent and tossed aside even the barest semblance of justice in favor of a system automatically tilted toward the prosecution
2759346 also please ask whomever is your choice for president why he bought 5 6 million dollars in advertising during the olympics knowing what china is doing in darfur tibet berma and other human and animal rights violations

2759545 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2759546 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2759547 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2759548 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2759549 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2759550 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2759551 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2759552 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2759557 it is urgent to reconvene this committee which i am told has not met for quite some time
2759558 it is regrettable that some members of political parties such as pas pkr and umno were involved in the almost violent demonstration
2759559 we should be aware of sensitivities about religions by all respective believers therefore all politicians must take a rational and reasonable approach to look at how to fine tune the relevant laws and procedures to avoid or minimise potential inter religious controversies and conflicts
2759560 i think the blue skies will come especially after todays rain
2759561 today is raining and tomorrow will have rain too that will help reduce the air pollution level we believe the current air flow will be helpful in the dispersion of pollutants in the air
2759562 you can control beijing as much as you like but youre not going to see much of an effect
2759563 on the day of opening ceremonies we had rain clouds in the southwest and northwest they were moving closer to the birds nest and there was a high probability of rain
2759564 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2759565 william buckland revolutionised the teaching of science in oxford and was the most charismatic teacher of his day
2759566 where has the kirkuk crisis reached now what solutions are there what is the status of deliberations are we rotating in a vicious circle
2759567 where statements are made here and there leading to entrenchment behind political parties and trends in the arena
2759568 the kirkuk issue has reached the point where the components of the city lack trust in each other and that this was reflected in the iraqi parliament this lack of trust resulted in changing drafts 10 or 11 times concerning article 24 of the provincial council election law the changes involved certain phrases due to their sensitivity also resulting from the lack of trust among these components
2759569 the current discussions and deliberations rotate around the un proposal and we believe that this proposal is good except for some points that were raised by the two sides i believe that all sides have faith in the de mistura proposal but that lack of trust is the cause of the obstruction or delay that takes place every now and then
2759570 until the concerns of brother arabs and turkomans are eased
2759571 we support the holding of elections together with the distribution of administrative posts
2759572 because we were the side that requested such a committee to be formed from the beginning
2759573 this issue raises the concern of arabs and turkomans in kirkuk we began to establish the citys administration in the wake of the downfall of the former regime but the course of political action in kirkuk took a different trend as there was monopolization of power and occupation of government buildings and military camps
2759574 to begin with i object to the use of the term sunni arabs because the arabs in kirkuk sunnis and shiis are one component of the city the use of this term aims to fragment arab ranks in kirkuk
2759575 the concerns of brother arabs and turkomans are serious because since 9 april 2003 a drastic change has been taking place on the ground not mere allegations by brother arabs and turkomans and this was proved by the statistics used for allocating the 2008 budget funds
2759576 nevertheless the kurdish brothers did not adhere to implementing what was agreed and accordingly our concerns are serious this is why we insist on introducing guarantees to the provincial council election law
2759577 regrettably until this moment no consensus has been reached on the city and its administration
2759578 kirkuk is kurdish and i believe that it is so and i have ottoman documents of kurdish individuals who are not involved in this case to support my belief
2759579 this is because they know quite well that they will not win the seats that they already had
2759580 there is a moderate solution presented by the un secretary general which is being studied and there are continuous sessions about it despite the problems that were raised i believe that this proposal will be a decisive solution to the ambitions of the brothers in the kurdistan alliance and the legitimate rights of the brother arabs and turkomans in kirkuk otherwise we will be heading to hell and to further complications in kirkuk and the entire iraq
2759581 the citizens of kirkuk should determine the future of their city
2759582 the kurdistan alliance views the solution as one that is based on article 140 of the constitution
2759583 es importante que la gente opine ya que se trata de una consulta fundamental para la consecuci n de un estado democr tico la idea es invitar a la ciudadan a a que participe en la consulta p blica a realizarse en dos semanas
2759584 queremos manifestar nuestro inter s en que la ciudadan a participe abierta y libremente para que diga si est a favor o no de la reforma energ tica que propone el presidente espurio felipe calder n por ello estaremos haciendo recorridos de este tipo en toda la zona metropolitana para invitar a la ciudadan a a que se sume a la consulta
2759585 es por su seguridad recuerden que hay gente que no ve con buenos ojos nuestro movimiento
2759586 ese se or era el ingeniero heberto castillo en aquel entonces l der del partido mexicano de los trabajadores

2759598 die familie wird immer ein bisschen pendeln aber kalifornien ist bei uns sehr verwachsen
2759599 vom fc bayern werden erfolge erwartet bei allen neuerungen die jetzt eingef hrt werden
2759600 wir m ssen nicht jedes jahr deutscher meister werden aber wir wollen jedes jahr in die champions league
2759601 um hohe ziele zu erreichen braucht es schon die rib rys und tonis und die kosten geld
2759602 zu erwarten der fc bayern k nne in der k nigsklasse eine besondere rolle spielen wird immer unrealistischer
2759603 clubs die sechsmal mehr einnehmen als wir aus dem verkauf der tv rechte oder die eigent merstruktur in italien und england mit milliard ren wie berlusconi oder abramowitsch
2759604 wir leben in der liga eine extreme solidarit t manchmal habe ich den eindruck da ist zu viel bsirske und verdi und zu wenig winterkorn und vw
2759605 wir sind gerade der h lle entkommen da macht ihr uns auch nichts mehr aus
2759606 wir haben die nacht im keller bei kerzenschein ausgeharrt denn wir hatten solche angst dass die russen wieder zuschlagen und als uns unsere soldaten aus dem keller holten und zu bussen brachten mussten wir an so vielen toten vorbei es war so schrecklich berall lagen leichen
2759607 angesichts der verlautbarungen von al qaida und islamischer dschihad union iju sind wir davon berzeugt dass man beschlossen hat anschl ge auch in deutschland zu begehen
2759608 wir werden tats chlich erst kurz vor dem dritten wahlgang entscheiden was wir machen
2759609 ich hatte ja nie damit gerechnet ich dachte dass ich vielleicht 1 07 5 schwimmen kann
2759610 da niemand mitgegangen ist mit mir habe ich schon gedacht dass ich einen fehlstart gemacht habe so ein schnelles rennen habe ich mir nie erwartet
2759611 das war f r alle berraschend auch f r meinen papa
2759612 aber im halbfinale sollte schon noch ein bisschen gehen doch ich werde mich anstrengen m ssen
2759613 ich habe nicht gedacht dass ich so schnell bin ich wollte eher auf der zweiten l nge mehr machen
2759614 am vormittag schwimme ich gut das habe ich die ganze zeit trainiert
2759615 da sollte eine steigerung m glich sein die zeit ist mir egal aber ich probiere alles um irgendwie ins finale zu kommen vielleicht geht es auf alle haben chancen vielleicht bleibt heute der eine oder andere zu lange auf
2759616 das rennen war super vielleicht w re sogar noch mehr gegangen
2759617 man darf aber auch die kleinen quiekser nicht untersch tzen
2759618 aber sollen wir deshalb den ganzen tag jammern und heulen

2759630 es muy dif cil jugar el primer partido en los juegos y lo hemos saldado con sobresaliente grecia tuvo un muy buen ritmo pero luego pudimos controlar el partido cometieron muchos fallos en los tiros libres 11 convertidos de 24 lanzados y eso tiene que ver mucho con el resultado final el 90 por ciento de las sensaciones son buenas es muy dif cil jugar en el debut como lo han demostrado los griegos que han cometido muchos fallos provocados y otros sin provocar no estuvieron centrados y eso fue porque les creamos dificultades
2759631 hay que pensar que cada d a es importante se es el otro diez por ciento
2759632 aunque tiene s lo 17 a os es muy maduro jug excelente pero no en todos los partidos puede hacerlo a la perfecci n no he tenido ninguna conversaci n con l no me sorprende la expectaci n que levanta lo que s me sorprenden son sus respuestas es un jugador que cuando dices algo entiende atiende y asimila pero no se puede juzgar cada detalle suyo

2759643 we are asking people to take medication take any pets you may have in your home anything that you require for today
2759644 after it was printed and copies were loaded on a train heading to southern egypt on saturday night orders were issued to prevent distribution
2759645 we have not received an official notice that the newspaper has been confiscated the newspaper was pulled out of the market last night we do not know who did this
2759646 is a major egyptian personality involved in the murder of the lebanese singer suzanne tamim
2759647 but the public prosecutor is investigating the papers violation of a news blackout on a case currently before the public prosecutor
2759648 the russians need control over energy routes from central asia and the caspian sea
2759649 in addition they want to get rid of us they want regime change
2759650 every democratic movement in this neighbouring region must be got rid of
2759651 we have been handed a note that from 5 a m 0100 gmt georgia stopped firing and is withdrawing forces from the conflict zone but our information does not confirm the georgian statement
2759652 we will offer a resolution today that makes clear that the russian actions in georgia are unacceptable to the international community and we condemn this military assault
2759653 well see whats in there then well know what to do
2759654 city turns into human hell many people still trapped under rubble
2759655 all georgian troops have been withdrawn from the conflict zone
2759656 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2759657 i was assured no economic blockade shall be allowed and every effort will be made to keep the highway open
2759658 i request you dont go by the other road it is not good for us and not good for you as well
2759659 from tomorrow there will be a great meeting of our peoples to continue to deepen the process of change
2759660 theyll remain deadlocked and each side will use it to become more deeply entrenched in their positions
2759661 the government is a satellite of hugo chavez and wants to impose a constitution that centralizes destroys institutions and the economy
2759662 however with new developments in europe being delayed and new regulations limiting land sales in china this sector may soon experience the same declining investment other property types have
2759663 we have no plans to insert money into either of those two institutions
2759664 lenovo has just come to the forefront of the global stage we still have a long way to go to become as strong as those companies that are on the fortune 500 year after year
2759665 hes chairman of the board but hes got a very good pulse of the rhythm of the business hes not just a strategic thinker but he also understands execution
2759666 in the company hes very much viewed as a rock star
2759667 lenovos next challenges are expanding its market share through expanding its consumer portfolio and of course overseas acquisitions but that will be by chance
2759668 he looks scholarly and refined but actually he is very ambitious and aggressive
2759669 he can not only tolerate people with different backgrounds but outsource power to his professional management which is not easy for a chinese entrepreneur
2759670 overall the picture is one of a still tight market with growing demand vulnerable to supply risks
2759671 upside risks remain we expect prices to range in a us 110 us 130 band for the next 18 months while not ruling out investor driven price spikes
2759672 the world will experience a serious oil supply crunch within five to ten years unless there is a collapse in oil demand
2759673 given recent price experience a spike in excess of us 200 per barrel is not infeasible
2759674 we think that the recent sharp falls in commodity prices are more than just a temporary dip in an upward trend
2759675 commodity prices are now much higher and affordability more stretched than they were a year ago implying greater scope for further falls
2759676 the global demand environment is clearly much weaker the oecd organisation for economic cooperation and development economies grew by just over three per cent in 2006 but many are now flirting with outright recession
2759677 the two firms want to set up similar warehouses in thailand as it is a profitable business and there is demand they are looking for land in bangkok and may finalise a deal soon
2759678 the combination of explosive growth in high net worth individuals and commercial flights becoming more of a problem will drive demand in the future
2759679 there are 9 500 business jets in the us today while china a country of similar size with 1 3 billion population has only 30 business jets leaving a lot of room for expansion
2759680 we want to be at the forefront of this development and lead the expansion
2759681 take for example schools and colleges especially in hostels where students are not allowed to carry handphones so the alternative is to use payphone
2759682 it is also cumbersome for immigrant workers to use handphones as they need to register thus we are looking at installing payphones at these strategic areas
2759683 for instance the phone booth can become a place for people to put up advertisements and in future can be a retail reach for customers
2759684 we are in discussions with some of the internet operators that have licence to go and put base stations above our phone booths we can reach retail people through such network
2759685 we also want to do paypoint or payment services through payphones that is another area to add on
2759686 they can send some credit to their countries which means they pay here and then the other side can get some credit facilities for them to call anywhere
2759687 so that is our target our target initially is indonesia then we will go to bangladesh nepal and the philippines
2759688 with the recent takeover of tm payphone we are now trying to build up the payphone business starting with the launch of the new logo helo and rebranding of tm payphone to pernec paypoint
2759689 they tm payphone were not making money it is not easy but we see there are many other areas that we can add on to the payphone business such as value added services and try to do advertisements
2759690 we also have a factory in tikam batu kedah built in 1982 and today we are still there but more on repairing payphones and doing multi purpose jobs for telcos and also some telephone poles we have 200 people working in the factory
2759691 telekom malaysias offer to sell its payphone unit also prompted us to relook at venturing into uzbekistan

2759702 i have to act like it never happened because i have so many tough races ahead of me
2759703 one of the most important lessons of the wars in iraq and afghanistan is that military success is not sufficient to win
2759704 it simply does not have the built in domestic constituency of defense programs
2759705 as an example the f 22 aircraft is produced by companies in 44 states thats 88 senators
2759706 why put off till tomorrow what we can do today
2759707 the idealist would rather build castles in the air than construct a durable bungalow on earth
2759708 the realist never lifts up his head high enough or long enough to see what is actually happening in the world
2759709 go off half cocked with very little sense of the resources needed to solve a problem and without a clear understanding of the current situation to anticipate all of the consequences associated with a particular solution
2759710 if bold vision is lacking then when will risks be taken and progress made without courage and vision where is the capacity to endure against adversity

2759721 no queremos que avance un metro mas la carretera porque fue un gran enga o del se or alcalde ricardo tripainao diciendo que era mejoramiento de camino esto no es mejoramiento de camino sino que derechamente una carretera
2759722 nosotros protegemos adoramos amamos e invocamos a la madre naturaleza y no permitiremos que sigan adelante con estos destrozos esto es un atropello del gobierno y esperamos que se presenten a darnos una explicaci n en el lugar afectado
2759723 lo que proponemos como alternativa es que la carretera pueda pasar por otra v a
2759724 nosotros no estamos en contra del camino porque es necesario pero queremos que se respeten los lugares sagrados

2759778 it could be regarded as interfering in the internal affairs of georgia
2759779 we always have and we continue to respect russian people and culture
2759780 we are concerned that their authorities use of military power may ruin the long term friendship between georgian and russian people

2759822 if our wrong doing only underlines and confirms gods right doing shouldnt we be commended for helping out since our bad words dont even make a dent in his good words isnt it wrong of god to back us to the wall and hold us to our word
2759823 hi paul yeah i am a first time caller but a long time listener oh and a big fan i have your first book and going to buy your second anyway it seems to me that if i sin more doesnt god get more glory for being more gracious and more merciful that only means that i should try harder to sin make god look better right the way i see it god cant judge me or punish me if i do all of this for him right can i say hi to my mom and give a shout out to my boys at the factory

2759847 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2759848 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2759849 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2759850 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2759857 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2759858 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2759859 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2759916 un gioco che francamente intriso di disonest ed ipocrisia laddove il contatto fisico obiettivamente lunica ragion dessere di tutti gli sport di squadra di regola il pretesto per ottenere un vantaggio immeritato sullavversario che cosa pu trasmettere di buono tutto questo si scoperto non pi tardi di un anno fa che non per la prima volta tra latro alcune squadre vendevano e compravano le partite il risultato lasciamo perdere tutti dietro a questo sport meraviglioso ancora pi di prima complimenti
2759917 qualche anno fa un tizio durante una partita sputa in pieno viso a un suo avversario immaginiamo unaltra scena allora visto che laltra volta andata forte ci troviamo allarchivio come di consueto io entro e sputo in faccia a qualcuno di voi non so magari perch non mi piaciuto il libro che avete proposto ma cerchiamo di visualizzare la scena un momento che livello di bassezza umana deve possedere un uomo per sputare in faccia ad unaltro che ne sarebbe di me subito dopo credo che sarei coperto di biasimo e messo alla porta emarginato con buona ragione il calciatore in questione se non vi ricordate chi basta che accendiate la televisione ed rimasto un tale beniamino della gente che la vod ne pensa bene di caricargli la groppa di milioni come non ne avesse gi abbastanza ma un momento di chi la colpa della vod ne o della gente che ancora sostiene questo tipo di personaggi facendone dei testimonial appetibili

2759923 il mondo in cui viviamo non certo stupendo e si sa fin da sempre che rincoglionire la gente per assopirne la coscienza lobiettivo di ogni buon governo ma per quanto in questi tempi esso venga perseguito con un dispendio di mezzi ed energie senza pari ancora alla maggior parte della popolazione non del tutto preclusa la possibilit di essere persone intelligenti il sonno della ragione genera fottuti mostri no e non esiste un diritto a questo sonno per nessuno e di sicuro non mai giustificabile neppure da una pressione fiscale eccessiva

2759939 you are so old why are you still working so hard here
2759940 i am going to implore the gods to help us crush our enemy if this coin lands with the heads on top well win if its tails well lose our fate is in the hands of the gods lets pray wholeheartedly
2759941 its good to have the gods on our side no one can change what they have determined
2759942 o sakyamuni canst thou teach a lesson to the king that will divert his mind and benefit him at the same time
2759943 i shall tell thee the parable of the hungry dog
2759944 the tathagata can quicken the spiritual ears of the powerful and when thou great king hearest the dog bark think of the teachings of the buddha and thou mayest still learn to pacify the monster
2759945 hey stupid old man whats wrong with you only a fool would risk his life for the sake of an ugly evil creature dont you know you could kill yourself trying to save that ungrateful scorpion
2759946 my friend just because it is the scorpions nature to sting that does not change my nature to save
2759947 monks im so unhappy i have twelve cows and i dont know why they all ran away i have also a few acres of a sesame seed plantation and the insects have eaten up everything i suffer so much i think i am going to kill myself
2759948 my friend we have not seen any cows passing by here you might like to look for them in the other direction
2759949 my dear friends you are the happiest people in the world you dont have any cows to lose if you have too many cows to take care of you will be very busy
2759950 that is why in order to be happy you have to learn the art of cow releasing laughter you release the cows one by one in the beginning you thought that those cows were essential to your happiness and you tried to get more and more cows but now you realize that cows are not really conditions for your happiness they constitute an obstacle for your happiness that is why you are determined to release your cows
2759951 why do you keep pouring when the cup is full
2759952 that you are similarly attempting to understand zen while your mind is full first empty your mind of preconceptions before you attempt to understand zen
2759953 if your mind is empty it is always ready for anything it is open to everything
2759954 i am confused master their positions regarding the issue are completely opposite they cant be both right how could you say that they are both correct
2759955 as monks we are supposed to keep away from women i am really ashamed and troubled by what you did today
2759956 oh so that has been bothering you brother i have left the girl behind by the river bank why are you still carrying her around
2759957 you do not see it because you have the notion of a self
2759958 because i have the notion of a self i do not see it has the master seen it
2759959 the notion of you in addition to the notion of a self further keeps you from seeing
2759960 if there is neither the notion of you nor the notion of a self can it be seen
2759961 if there is neither you nor a self then who wants to see it
2759962 when you are hungry eat when you are tired sleep
2759963 no no most people entertains a thousand desires when they eat and scheme over a thousand plans when they sleep
2759964 dont think that im crying because im afraid of you i am not even afraid of birth and death i feel sorry for you young people you are strong and healthy yet instead of doing things that are beneficial for others you hurt people by robbing them of course what you are doing is not acceptable and cannot be tolerated by society what is worse is that you will all go to hell and suffer great pain i am so worried about you that i cannot restrain myself and am shedding tears for you
2759965 unmoved by the eight worldly winds serenely i sit on the purplish gold terrace
2759966 you said you are no longer moved by the eight worldly winds and yet with just one fart you ran across the river like a rat
2759967 thirty years well i can cross the river using the boat for only one penny
2759968 if youre living in la without any family the only reason you should be here is if youre working for the industry
2759969 id like one under cooked egg so that its runny and one over cooked egg so that its tough and hard to eat id also like grilled bacon which is a bit on the cold side burnt toast butter straight from the freezer so that its impossible to spread and a pot of very weak lukewarm coffee
2759970 perdona mi atrevimiento pero por qu dices eso si tu coraz n no es ni siquiera aproximadamente tan hermoso como el m o o el de tantas otras personas
2759971 compara tu coraz n con el m o el m o es perfecto en cambio el tuyo es un conjunto de cicatrices y dolor
2759972 tu coraz n luce perfecto pero yo jam s me involucrar a contigo mira cada cicatriz representa una persona a la cual entregu todo mi amor arranqu trozos de mi coraz n para entreg rselos a cada uno de aquellos que he amado muchos a su vez me han obsequiado un trozo del suyo que he colocado en el lugar que qued abierto de ah quedaron los huecos dar amor es arriesgar pero a pesar del dolor que esas heridas me producen al haber quedado abiertas me recuerdan que los sigo amando y alimentan la esperanza que alg n d a tal vez regresen y llenen el vac o que han dejado en mi coraz n comprendes ahora lo que es verdaderamente hermoso
2759973 s en verdad ahora puedo ver lo hermoso que es tu coraz n
2759974 i want to eat fewer meals out and more healthy meals in
2759975 yeah these girls are beautiful but there are only three of them i need double digits
2759976 yeah these girls are kind of beautiful but theyre sixes and sevens i only deal with nines or better
2759977 consumers who are more american than other consumers prefer product a
2759978 avoid the times when there have been really rancorous debates in the confirmation process
2759979 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2759980 there was a very large of amount of fire when we arrived
2759981 hearing the news was tragic stunning words cant describe it
2759982 how can i help thats all we were thinking we talked about how the best thing we could do was try to play volleyball
2759983 it meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys when we heard from him
2759984 he talked about trying to move on he just told us it will be difficult but together well be much stronger
2759985 we wanted to have a moment of silence where we could gather our thoughts before starting this journey
2759986 it was a moment of silence to honor the bachman family
2759987 the one thing weve always talked about is that this is about a team its not about individual people
2759988 the thing that came across as hugh was talking to us is you know what ive got this happening right now but we came here with a goal in mind and weve invested all this time in it and we need to go out there and try to complete what we started
2759989 it means going out there and playing better every match than we did the previous match
2759990 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2759991 maybe thats why it hurt so much it just felt so close
2759992 the best way we can honor them at this juncture is to go out and compete every day and play hard every day and enjoy and love the game of volleyball and it is a game
2759993 we should be playing it and enjoying it and loving it as they would
2759994 were totally aware that we may see him and we may not
2759995 thats completely all right with us he has other priorities
2759996 id much rather be sitting on the bench telling him what i think he should be doing rather than where i am now
2759997 baikal is the greatest lake in the world it is a limitless reserve and source for water that all of humanity can drink without any sort of purification

2759999 we say that only romantics do this sort of work
