5170019 for the offense that it suffered with the books publishing
5170020 it is a book that is absolutely not refraining from desecrating something that is considered by all muslims as untouchable obviously someone wishes to join the ranks of those who produced those cartoons in denmark and of course this is an insult to all muslims of the world particularly for us here in serbia

5170037 this government has a lot to answer for it didnt keep a grip on the banks and credit card companies which let unsustainable credit rip at a totally unsustainable rate and families here in bury are getting crucified as a result
5170038 there is no question that times are tough for people facing rising food and fuel bills and the latest figures are obviously concerning
5170039 the cattle market shopping leisure and housing development in bury will give the area a lift when the local economy is facing pressures

5170043 its been a really good day its been so nice to see so many people out here in such glorious weather and in such a superb setting
5170044 its been a lovely show its something that has long been needed in suffolk
5170045 there has been a fantastic atmosphere and i have seen people i know it was terrible trying to get in though the traffic was enormous and could have been better organised but it was still a really nice day
5170046 sometimes people think it is a bit geeky a bit beard and sandals
5170047 but there is a younger generation coming through who are more into extreme machines and there are some really flashy vehicles
5170048 i am an adrenalin junkie and love having my bum close to the ground racing at a ridiculous speed everyone here has scars to show from racing but once you are bitten by the bug you cannot let it go
5170049 you are so low to the ground it gives you tremendous feeling of going really fast

5170060 faced with a rising birth rate and an increase in more complex births it is a gross understatement to say that 160 midwives are needed
5170061 with an emerging baby boom we need at a conservative estimate at least 610 more midwives in the region
5170062 how can we expect them to cope when we are in the midst of a baby boom and their workload is racing ahead of staff numbers
5170063 midwives are struggling to provide the one to one care promised by the government and the birthrate is set to carry on rising
5170064 across the country we are really beginning to see the quality of maternity care being compromised by poor staffing levels
5170065 we also need trusts in the region to make maternity services a priority so that mothers and babies get the service they need and deserve
5170066 morale among midwives is low we want to see midwives valued and cherished and rewarded in their pay for their skill and dedication the challenge for the trusts in this region is to make maternity services a priority and show that this service really does matter
5170067 clinicians from across the region have come together with patients and stakeholders to say this is our vision of a better future for our nhs
5170068 the vision whilst recommending change also delivers stability for staff and local people clearly stating that there is a sustainable future for 17 acute trusts in the region all continuing to operate accident and emergency and maternity services suffolk homes
5170069 we definitely have a very strong line up of aircraft and a tremendous amount of hard work has gone in to coming up with this exciting programme despite increased costs this year due in no small part to increased fuel prices
5170070 we would obviously like to thank all the sponsors who have come on board to help get this air show off the ground once again and without their generous support none of this would be possible
5170071 it is one of the biggest dates on the districts calendar and a very popular one
5170072 the stadium is awesome i heard people sitting near me saying it wasnt just a step forward for the us it was more like being on another planet the visibility is better than layer road and the atmosphere is good
5170073 i think there were some teething problems but hopefully they will be easily addressed
5170074 there were some cars parked in united way and axel way but all of the ones we saw were ticketed so hopefully they wont do it again it looked like some people had left their cars in the business park as well but id sooner they went there than residential areas suffolk homes

5170079 the main problem facing st marys nowadays is that voices are changing even earlier these days

5170128 estou cansado de responder a essa pergunta quando as coisas v o bem e os resultados acontecem v m os elogios n o me abato com as cr ticas e n o me iludo com eles
5170129 o vasco tem uma marca forte e uma pena que nos ltimos anos tenha passado por esta crise financeira mas mesmo assim as cr ticas t m o mesmo peso daquelas s o feitas a clubes que t m condi o de montar grandes times
5170130 fizemos quatro no sport seis no atl tico e tr s no palmeiras temos que pontuar dentro de fora de casa o clima fica bem mais calmo na prele o antes da partida falei como a nossa a nossa segunda feira e nossa quinta feira foram diferentes uma de tristeza e outra de alegria

5170134 right after he cleared waivers we put a call in to his agent and just expressed our interest and the opportunity for him they made a quick decision and were happy it worked out
5170135 defensively i think hes a plus player offensively he may add a little bounce to our lineup which i think is important i just think his overall game and what hes capable of doing is something that interests us given where we are in the season and seeing how brendan was performing at the time we thought it would be a good opportunity for him to get to memphis
5170136 brendan is a young guy with a lot of future when he was playing enough it was kind of acceptable now he isnt playing enough so felipe is a better fit and it gets ryan down there playing well see him in september brendan has his whole career ahead of him
5170137 obviously to get a game pitched so well up until the ninth and then to have the outcome the way it did in terms of a home run hit walk it was tough its something tony la russa dunc dave duncan and i will talk about tomorrow and strategize and see what makes the most sense
5170138 but you cant keep giving games away like that obviously were not in a situation where we can really go out and necessarily find someone to close were very supportive of izzy and weve stood by him but at some point weve got to get some results everythings an option right now we have to be open minded and make the best decision for this club
5170139 four or five years ago a suspect event took place in new york
5170140 a building collapsed and they said that 3 000 people had been killed whose names were never published
5170141 under this pretext they the united states attacked afghanistan and iraq and since then a million people have been killed
5170142 jnovitz i suspect the problem isnt that the victims were that utterly vaporized so much as that their remains were too splattered over too much debris to be identifiable as

5170148 if its ironic humor when black people call their black friends nigger then why isnt it funny when i call black people nigger
5170149 rape jokes have a purpose and thats to remind women that they are only safe at mens pleasure that all women are vulnerable to rape and that the men telling the joke think this situation is funny
5170150 feel helpless and laughing is the best we can do
5170151 when could this be funny and why and how can we use that to positive effect
5170152 i think you should spend less time concerning yourself with feminist theory and more time getting in touch with reality
5170153 tragedy is when i cut my finger comedy is when you fall into an open sewer and die

5170215 n esenta lor ozn urile sunt manifestarea unei lumi pline de duhuri si de fantome al c rei univers mintal este straniu si aberant este realitatea unei lumi dominate de iluzie n care realitatea ns si este distorsionat de forte stranii care n mod v dit pot manipula spatiul timpul si materia fizic forte care se situeaz aproape n totalitate dincolo de puterea noastr de ntelegere aparitiile ozn par a fi pe de a ntregul variatii minore ale fenomenelor demonice vechi de c nd lumea
5170216 multe dintre rapoartele asupra ozn urilor care se public n prezent n presa de mare audient la public relateaz incidente care sunt izbitor de asem n toare fenomenelor de posedare demonic psihice sau de alt fel pe care teologii si parapsihologii le cunosc de mult vreme
5170217 devenisem complet obsedat de ozn uri eram convins c ceva absolut m ret mi se va nt mpla n cur nd am renuntat la lecturile zilnice din biblie nu m am mai g ndit la dumnezeu dar n schimb am nceput s citesc cu nversunare toate c rtile despre ozn uri care mi c deau n m n vegheam noptile astept nd n zadar s mai primesc vreun semn ncercam s comunic mental cu ceea ce eu credeam c sunt fiinte extraterestre aproape c m rugam la ei s mi apar n fat sau s intre ntr un fel n leg tur cu mine
5170218 deci ntr una din nopti pe la miezul noptii se f cu zgomot mare de pasi ce parc jucau si de murmure ca de multe voci n schit iar chilia lui anatolie se umplu de lumin
5170219 si c nd fratii l traser cu de a sila haina cu pricina se f cu nev zut din m inile lor

5170241 pursuant to 4 u s c chapter 1 1 2 amp 3 executive order 10834 august 21 1959 24 f r 6865 a military flag is a flag that resembles the regular flag of the united states except that it has a yellow fringe border on three sides the president of the united states designates this deviation from the regular flag by executive order and in his capacity as commander in chief flag martial law the placing of a fringe on the national flag the dimensions of the flag and the arrangement of the stars in the union are matters of detail not controlled by statute but are within the discretion of the president as commander in chief of the army and navy
5170242 a military flag is a flag that resembles the regular flag of the united states except that it has a yellow fringe border on three sides
5170243 the use of such a fringe is prescribed in current army regulation no 260 10

5170246 the organic label may conjure an image of a simpler agriculture but its very existence is an industrial artifact
5170247 so is an industrial organic food chain finally a contradiction in terms its hard to escape the conclusion that it is of course it is possible to live with contradictions at least for a time and sometimes it is necessary or worthwhile
5170248 the inspiration for organic was to find a way to feed ourselves more in keeping with the logic of nature to build a food system that looked more like an ecosystem that would draw its fertility and energy from the sun as in so many other realms natures logic has proven no match for the logic of capitalism
5170249 compared to conventional chickens i was told these organic birds have it pretty good
5170250 seldom if ever stepped upon the chicken house lawn is scrupulously maintained nevertheless to honor an ideal nobody wants to admit has now become something of a joke an empty pastoral conceit
5170251 they get a few more square inches of living space per bird though it was hard to see how they could be packed together much more tightly and because there are no hormones or anti biotics in their feed to accelerate growth they get to live a few days longer
5170252 better for what if the answer is for my health the answer again is probably but not automatically

5170258 i feel very proud and honoured to be an australian with a gold medal around my neck at the olympic games
5170259 i believe we came so close in sydney and athens that this makes up for those very close defeats
5170260 i dont feel any regret about not going to athens you move on and you deal with it but to come from a nation thats so strong in terms of triathlon its a fantastic feeling to finally bring home a gold medal
5170261 this would reduce the percentage of students who engage in suicidal thinking who contemplate how to make an attempt and who continue to make attempts

5170279 helical peptide arrays on self assembled monolayer surfaces through soft and reactive landing of mass selected ions
5170280 our previous studies showed that soft landing can be used to prepare ultrapure peptide layers on substrates the question we faced was in addition to controlling purity can we also control the structure of the molecules we showed we could
5170281 because we were starting from something that wasnt helical in solution we were a little pessimistic whether it would work at all
5170282 we found an interesting pathway to conduct different types of chemical reactions between complex molecules and substrates that will potentially enable us to prepare materials that cannot be made by standard methods
5170283 we hope to conduct lots of chemistry on the thin films

5170295 i played a game i truly loved to play since i was a kid
5170296 they gave me a number and now its hanging from the rafters
5170297 i got a chance to watch craig become one of the best second basemen to ever play this game
5170298 to have my number retired next to yours is not only fitting but truly an honor
5170299 we stood next to each other for so many years we had a great ride now we stand side by side forever my friend
5170300 we went to the astrodome and the rodeo was in town and there was no astroturf just dirt
5170301 so we drew a diamond and he taught me how to play the position the right way i will never forget that
5170302 i remember him telling me if we do this switch i dont want to be just good at it
5170303 i told him if you want to be really good at this you have to think about gold gloves he won four of them
5170304 like when he would accidentally move his arm out and accidentally get hit by the pitch
5170305 i have no regrets as far as any of the decision making i ever made in my career because ive done everything this organization ever asked me to do
5170306 if that day is to come and happen in a couple of years
5170307 i get goose bumps thinking about it if thats to happen how great would it be for a city i love so much an organization i love so much and for my family and i well keep our fingers crossed
5170308 i think the coolest thing about being an astros fan is that they love the astros logo so much
5170309 but they surely love the person who wears it more
5170310 keep that number alive and this is something to motivate the next kid coming along pose that to drayton see what he says
5170311 if i were the next guy i would think that would be too much pressure
5170312 wasnt it bobby murcer who replaced mickey mantle in center field he was a great player if he hadnt replaced mickey mantle he probably would have been even greater thats intimidating when you put someone in mickey mantles place or craig biggios place at second base or jeff bagwells place thats a lot of pressure
5170313 this is the number of craig biggio for two decades he did everything this franchise asked of him he gave more effort and got more out of his ability than anybody in his generation honor his memory
5170314 you think about it and there are only two no 7s ever retired mickey mantle and craig biggio i grew up on long island in new york thats how i started off i love this game everything i have is because of the game and my passion for the game i try to give back to the game as much as i can to have your number retired thats pretty high cotton
5170315 this is probably the best game ive seen him throw in two or three years
5170316 i thought it was without question his best outing this year and the second best outing ive ever seen him throw
5170317 the other was in 05 game 6 of the nlcs i think we saw two of the best ever throw sunday the other guy was pretty good but made one mistake and it cost him
5170318 i was looking for a pitch middle in from randy and i think he probably made a mistake and i was able to get it
5170319 i didnt make the pitch i needed to and roy pitched outstanding
5170320 you kind of knew after the first two games 12 2 and 11 5 arizona wins to see that kind of a performance three times wouldve been a lot to ask for
5170321 he pitched outstanding and i made one mistake which i guess is what it comes down to i started making the pitches after the fact and thats pretty much the whole ballgame really
5170322 i dont like the walks too much but i was able to recover on the one guy and pence threw the other guy out
5170323 big throw from the field and we got it going after the third inning
5170324 we always kind of check with oswalt a little bit
5170325 hes our stud so we check with him after an inning to see how he is and he was running on some fumes at the end i let the big boy finish
5170326 i started getting a little bit tired in the eighth laboring a little bit
5170327 i felt myself coming off the ball some and the ball was tailing back over the plate but i had enough to get through the eighth and valverde came in and closed it out

5170344 i feel so sorry for the loss i hope they the fans dont blame me and i can continue my badminton career and come to the olympics again
5170345 i hope the people of malaysia are not angry and disappointed because chong wei has tried his level best

5170347 with continuing publicity about the need for healthful diets and with new research about the harmful effects of eating too much sugar nationwide demand for sugar will no doubt decline therefore farmers in our state should use the land on which they currently grow sugar cane to grow peanuts a food that is rich in protein and low in sugar farmers in the neighboring country of palin greatly increased their production of peanuts last year and their total revenues from that crop were quite high

5170353 in our relationship with the north there always exists the possibility of localized conflict so we cannot afford to loosen our readiness
5170354 to start a new war on the peninsula and stifle the north with force
5170355 it is quite nonsensical for the u s to offer a handshake to its dialogue partner while holding a dagger in its other hand
5170356 because of these sneaky and treacherous attacks as your commander in chief i have ordered the armed forces of the philippines and philippine national police to defend every inch of philippine territory against milf forces and immediately restore peace in the affected areas in lanao del norte
5170357 we will not tolerate and we will crush any attempt to disturb peace and development in mindanao
5170358 we saw several dead bodies residents said they saw people being shot by armed men we also saw body parts even human skin its a bloody situation residents said it was the milf
5170359 they are now in the poblacion area town centre they have taken over the business center the rural banks pawnshops
5170360 it appears that several milf sub commanders are not controlled by the milf leadership but just using the peace process as the blanket to launch violent attacks against the people of mindanao
5170361 the recent milf perpetuated incidents in mindanao starting with the ambush of army troops of the 5th infantry battalion by the milf troops in lanao del sur yesterday is virtual declaration of war
5170362 these developments are clear manifestation of insincerity to the peace process of the significant portion of the milf
5170363 we have launched military operations in mindanao and this will go on until perpetrators are punished and normalcy is established in the area
5170364 they are taking hostages and ransacking businesses these are plain criminal actions and has no justification
5170365 the milf organization is quite loose in terms of control but the full force of the law must be applied at all times
5170366 this is not sanctioned there is no such order from milf leadership to launch an attack on government forces

5170386 i read somewhere how important it is in life not necessarily to be strong but to feel strong to measure yourself at least once to find yourself at least once in the most ancient of human conditions facing blind deaf stone alone with nothing to help you but your own hands and your own head
5170387 motivation is what gets you started habit is what keeps you going
5170388 im just fine i just want to have a little nap you see i appear to have been at the vets hospital all day where erm ive been asleep as well and erm my teeth hurt now and i think one of them is missing so if you wouldnt mind i think im going to take a little nap right now
5170389 it has been really lovely to have my first professional job to see what this industry is all about
5170390 it has really given me a taster and spurred me on to do this for the rest of my life hopefully

5170392 there was no theatre anywhere in britain dedicated to musical theatre
5170393 when the opportunity came and the university was looking to refurbish the theatre and reopen it with something the idea came together to make this a hub
5170394 it is not a hub that would do old classic musicals though we have got a few classics but mainly that would look for new work and make new work happen
5170395 it gives the students an experience of working as a rep company and what it is like

5170401 it is typical for chinese performers to wear different apparel from different ethnic groups there is nothing special about it
5170402 while the chinese government has built a gleaming new building for its official mouthpiece and its public relations strategy has become more sophisticated the propaganda it uses to maintain its iron fisted control over tibet remains the same
5170403 tibet supporters took action at cctv today to broadcast a message of truth about the intensifying military crackdown in tibet and the tibetan peoples undying resolve to regain their freedom
5170404 this is a very unwelcome and unacceptable action in china
5170405 tibet is part of china and the whole world recognizes it the free tibet movement is not welcome here a small number of people are trying to split the territory and that is not going to work at all

5170414 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5170415 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5170416 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5170417 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5170418 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5170419 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5170430 any chance of a new non russian pipeline out of central asia and into europe is pretty much dead
5170431 be careful when you fight the monsters lest you become one
5170432 i was walking down the street wearing glasses when the prescription ran out
5170433 im not sure it would speak to anyone else except maybe the people in a one block radius but to me its the sound of my neighborhood
5170434 we have an interest in sound and we have an interest in eavesdropping on people
5170435 there was a little road rash on his left shoulder
5170436 were thinking he might have fallen down from either intoxication or he might have fallen down because he had a seizure
5170437 since saturday liu has been in intolerable pain because of a right foot injury where the achilles tendon attaches to the heel
5170438 we did everything we could to treat the injury i have seen him shaking because he was in so much pain
5170439 but he came here with the best intention of competing liu would not withdraw unless there was no alternative
5170440 i believe they will understand this situation and encourage liu to overcome this problem
5170441 were two years into the measure c extension but no progress has been made
5170442 measure c funds arent being used developer impact fees paid to assist in its development arent being used
5170443 veterans boulevard is on the list but falls toward the lower end of the rankings
5170444 however those considerations are still tentative until the plan is approved
5170445 i always thought it was a better symbol of commitment than a ring
5170446 there was much discussion about what was the most romantic caliber
5170447 this is the first time ive heard of such a symbol of commitment of love
5170448 it sounds like theyre going to start off with a bang
5170449 shes one of the most unique people youre going to meet
5170450 shes one of those rare students who didnt give a rip what other people thought about her most kids are like thermometers conforming to whats around them charity is a climate changer
5170451 i asked him if he wanted some and he looked at me like i was really gross
5170452 i always thought youre supposed to marry your best friend
5170453 liu has two injuries one in his foot and one in his leg
5170454 one of the injuries is an accumulated injury in the past he has not dropped out of any competition easily
5170455 we came all this way only to see liu compete he is a sporting legend in china and we wanted him to win i am disappointed for myself but most of all i am disappointed for liu he will come back stronger but this was his time
5170456 its that mid range where we see people being much more careful
5170457 a chocolate fountain is one of the things when they have to start cutting the budget theyre going to cut
5170458 a lot of people are choosing family who have cameras to do their pictures
5170459 were going to do what were going to do to make it special
5170460 that they will look at their own situation realistically and have a wedding that they will not regret whether because it was beyond their means leaving them saddled with debt for years to come or because they skimped unnecessarily
5170461 overall as a group its an area we can get better at
5170462 this is a chance for young guys to show what they can do
5170463 any opportunity in the big leagues is an opportunity to grab a job thats the bottom line
5170464 un punto di arrivo ma un punto di partenza una proposta sulla quale chiamiamo a una vasta consultazione anche i singoli cittadini che vorranno dire la loro
5170465 il governo inglese ha prodotto un analogo libro verde sul mercato del lavoro che ha come titolo no one written off nessuno sia escluso e una semplice coincidenza per quanto ci riguarda siamo partiti dalla convinzione che occorra un ripensamento radicale del nostro modello sociale e questa operazione non pu essere realizzata solo da un governo il modello sociale parte della costituzione materiale di un paese e quindi il suo ridisegno o almeno i valori e la visione sui quali il modello sociale deve basarsi bene che siano ampiamente condivisi anche da larga parte dellopposizione e delle parti sociali
5170466 il libro verde apre la consultazione pubblica su ipotesi e pone quesiti per arrivare a un libro bianco nel quale si descriveranno pi compiutamente i valori e la visione del futuro modello sociale
5170467 di portare a sintesi varie culture che nel corso di questi anni si sono cimentate con il nuovo modello sociale vi si trova soprattutto la riaffermazione della centralit della persona pu sembrare retorica ma non lo perch quella centralit spesso stata negata dallautoreferenzialit di molti dei servizi offerti
5170468 una premessa personale appartengo a una storia politica di persone impegnate ad abrogare il sessantotto e sono convinto che il male italiano non sia cos oscuro ma che discenda dallanomalia del lungo e strano sessantotto italiano per come si intensivamente prolungato negli anni settanta e si propagato fino ai giorni nostri bene la parola che sintetizza lanomalo sessantotto italiano irresponsabilit e nichilismo diffuso e cinismo sono le caratteristiche prevalenti dei suoi figli
5170469 crisi culturale e di valori a partire dal misconoscimento della centralit della persona dalla insufficiente attenzione alla primaria difesa della vita dalla ricorrente negazione del ruolo della famiglia
5170470 con quellautoreferenzialit di cui parlavo prima con la chiusura corporativa con la negazione della centralit della persona laccento portato dal lato dellofferta tendenzialmente tutta pubblica ha esaltato i vizi del vecchio sistema risarcitorio e segmentato questo modello va superato perch inefficiente ed insostenibile sia il bilancio dello stato sia per le famiglie se guardiamo alla sostenibilit economica il bilancio dello stato destinato a pi che raddoppiare entro il 2050
5170471 non soltanto quellaspetto pesa e agisce sul sistema previdenziale e sul sistema sanitario ma possono pesare anche le nuove tecnologie se non sono combinate con una forte flessibilit organizzativa e con una forte riconversione perch altrimenti possono costituire meccanismi di aggravio aggiuntivo
5170472 fondato sullautosufficienza della persona sulla vita buona nella societ attiva perch individui a lungo attivi fanno una societ che non solo pi vitale e pi competitiva ma anche pi giusta e pi capace di costruire relazioni sociali
5170473 ed la vecchia storia del saggio che indica il cielo con un dito e di quelli che guardano il dito la societ attiva qualcosa di pi che una societ nella quale semplicemente si lavora pi a lungo nellarco della vita e innanzitutto la societ del riequilibrio demografico una societ ad alta natalit e una societ vitale il primo messaggio che questo libro verde vuol dare un messaggio opposto al nichilismo che noi leggiamo anche nella caduta della natalit e per questo che dobbiamo abrogare il sessantotto perch dobbiamo abrogare la perfida incultura del declino del rifiuto del futuro della sfiducia
5170474 mi diceva non devi credere che il sessantottismo sia lalba di una fase nuova in realt lultimo bagliore della societ industriale che muore io sono rimasto affezionato a questa definizione data in atto mentre le cose succedevano e non oggi decenni dopo perch riusciva a cogliere laspetto di un sessantotto ultimo figlio dellillusione di uno sviluppo infinito credo che sia stato proprio cos e che le derive prodotte dal sessantotto la perdita del senso della vita e del senso del futuro in italia siano state pagate a prezzi particolarmente alti perch la bassa crescita degli ultimi quindici anni perch abbiamo avuto tangentopoli e perch c stato un terrorismo quarantennale ancora non del tutto risolto
5170475 gli influssi sono vari c molta antropologia cristiana per esempio e c un vitalismo che arriva da pi culture diverse certo la sottolineatura della responsabilit individuale molto new labour se guardiamo il libro verde britannico di questi giorni sulla riforma del welfare vediamo che quellaspetto molto enfatizzato ma noi non ci preoccupiamo solo della persona isolata perch entra in gioco in modo esplicito la nostra forte cultura della famiglia guardiamo alla persona in s ma anche alle sue proiezioni nelle relazioni in particolare in quelle familiari
5170476 la mia terra veneta che pure si trasformata addirittura violentemente se valutiamo lintensit del fenomeno da economia agricola a economia industriale riuscita a farlo senza traumi c riuscita proprio perch in quel passaggio la famiglia stato uno straordinario ammortizzatore e perch in italia non abbiamo avuto le banlieus perch abbiamo avuto le famiglie e altri corpi intermedi tra i quali annovero la parrocchia come lassociazione di volontariato e lassociazione sindacale e le pi varie situazioni di rappresentanza di interessi
5170477 di fare comunit a partire dalle sue proiezioni essenziali che sono la famiglia il volontariato lassociazionismo e lambiente di lavoro sino a riscoprire luoghi relazionali e di servizio come le parrocchie le farmacie i medici di famiglia gli uffici postali le stazioni dei carabinieri
5170478 se vogliamo intervenire sullantropologia della persona e se vogliamo renderla autosufficiente durante lintero arco della vita abbiamo bisogno di riscoprire il territorio e nel territorio la comunit
5170479 che nasce dalla strategia di lisbona spiega sacconi e che fa il paio con lo stile di vita per quanto riguarda la salute
5170480 certamente no da noi questa impostazione non n accettabile n proponibile perch nella nostra cultura luniversalit un principio fondamentale del welfare e la selettivit che accompagna luniversalit non arriva al punto di premiare o di punire la responsabilit della persona selettivit per noi significa piuttosto tarare lintervento sul grado di bisogno anche se noi non possiamo non introdurre nel nostro modello sociale il binomio opportunit responsabilit in forme meno ideologiche per rispetto al modello inglese
5170481 il binomio opportunit responsabilit richiede anche qualche deterrenza e qualche penalizzazione altrimenti non inneschiamo comportamenti virtuosi
5170482 e ancora una volta un modello che troviamo in veneto e che vede integrati i servizi sanitari e socio assistenziali mentre sa riconoscere in sussidiariet la funzione della famiglia per una persona non autosufficiente per un anziano per un malato terminale significa veder riconosciuta la dignit della persona anche nelle fasi pi critiche al termine del ciclo di vita significa poter vivere nellambiente in cui si sempre vissuti senza che questo significhi scaricare sulla famiglia e sulle donne in particolare il prezzo di questo intervento solidale occorrono sistemi che sappiamo offrire varie alternative e tra queste privilegiare una solida assistenza domiciliare
5170483 e lo dimostra proprio il modello veneto il veneto ha saputo per primo chiudere gli ospedali in anni in cui era ancora pi difficile rispetto a oggi abbiamo affrontato e realizzato la chiusura di tutti gli ospedali mandamentali che pure erano strumento di identit di un territorio la chiusura di queste strutture marginali ha consentito non solo di concentrare i servizi che corrispondono allemergenza acuta e i servizi di eccellenza in alcuni pochi plessi ma ha consentito di organizzare con efficienza la medicina del territorio in veneto le strutture territoriali sono solide e fortemente intrecciate con alti tassi di volontariato incoraggiati a loro volta dal fatto che il sistema li considera adeguatamente questa forte protezione territoriale riduce il bisogno di ospedalit e cos facendo riduce la voce principale del costo sanitario
5170484 da quella tabella elaborata su dati di varie fonti ufficiali vediamo che come a livello qualitativo le prestazioni sanitarie in veneto e in emilia romagna sono praticamente uguali ma a un costo assai pi alto in emilia insomma il modello appenninico tosco emiliano di buona qualit ma guarda un po costa molto di pi perch l c meno vocazione alla sussidiariet tutto molto pi pubblico e pubblicistico
5170485 un paese spaccato a met con una parte meridionale arretratissima
5170486 che invece vogliamo semplicemente riqualificare in realt investiremo pi soldi sia nel 2009 sia nel biennio 2010 2011 esattamente cinque miliardi in pi anche per accelerare la riconversione dobbiamo imitare quello che in una parte ditalia avviene gi passare da un sistema basato tutto su troppi ospedali a una medicina del territorio e della prevenzione nella quale esistono strutture per lemergenza e dobbiamo rifondare il ruolo del medico di famiglia
5170487 con un nuovo e irrobustito percorso di accesso alla professione deve passare lidea della presa in carico della persona il cui simbolo il fascicolo sanitario elettronico che ti accompagna quando dal medico di base si passa a un distretto di medicina territoriale per una visita specialistica o quando si va in un ospedale per unemergenza
5170488 in cui si affermino le pratiche migliori e si responsabilizzino le gestioni inefficienti la prima sanzione di una gestione inefficiente laumento della pressione fiscale che oltre certi limiti non pu andare dopo scatta il fallimento politico degli amministratori il loro commissariamento la consegna dei libri agli elettori abbiamo bisogno di interrompere il circolo vizioso e se arrivano altri soldi per sanare i guai devono necessariamente essere messi in mano a nuove persone
5170489 questo senza dubbio un fortissimo condizionamento e voglio dire che stata davvero scellerata la decisione del governo che ci ha preceduto quando ha riaperto la voragine della spesa previdenziale lo dico fuori da polemiche che poco mi interessano ma lo dico perch non si debba ripetere lo stesso errore
5170490 no ma se pensiamo che era la cisl cio un sindacato a chiedere al governo precedente di non riaprire il vaso di pandora capiamo lentit e la gravit del problema adesso dobbiamo puntare al meglio come modello sociale e nel meglio c necessariamente una rigorosa sostenibilit unoperazione non facile ma possibile
5170491 direi anzi che la donna il cardine di questo progetto
5170492 dobbiamo renderci conto dellequazione che vale ormai per tutti i paesi industrializzati fra occupazione femminile e natalit
5170493 e lanomalia dei giovani vecchi come li chiama il demografo massimo livi bacci che lultima eredit tutta italiana della lunga stagione nichilista sessantottesca da noi la laurea arriva in media a ventotto anni e senza fare ingegneria fisica o matematica abbiamo corsi di laurea in scienza delle comunicazioni che interpretano il tre pi due costringendo lo studente a un biennio dopo un pessimo triennio una riforma pensata in buona fede per anticipare la fine del percorso di laurea e lingresso nel mercato del lavoro finisce per ottenere leffetto opposto mentre il rapporto pisa dice che i nostri studenti hanno un basso livello di conoscenze
5170494 non hanno il lavoro come parte del loro processo educativo
5170495 fin da subito nel ciclo di vita la base dellautonomia sociale delle persone e delle famiglie
5170496 famiglie che hanno compensato una certa distrazione con lofferta generosa ma ingannevole di beni materiali al posto di scelte educative pi impegnative si tende a scegliere luniversit pi facile fregando se stessi gli anni dai venti ai trenta sono diventati quasi di riposo mentre sono quelli che determinano la vita
5170497 intendo entrambe le cose e la famiglia deve incoraggiare a esperienze lavorative nel periodo estivo dopo i quindici anni penso soprattutto a quello che marco biagi ha disegnato in modo originale e cio lapprendistato che ti consenta di raggiungere titoli universitari
5170498 per la formazione qualcosa che deve interessare lintero arco della vita ora spendiamo moltissimo e malissimo dice ancora il ministro ed il momento di riconoscere la centralit dellimpresa il vecchio impianto la negava noi partiamo dallidea che limpresa il luogo formativo con opportuni accompagnamenti e con la verifica non formale delle conoscenze acquisite
5170499 oggi siamo alla battaglia finale allultima chiamata se perdiamo sar il declino la serie b dobbiamo liberare questo paese liberarne la vitalit la voglia di futuro abbiamo bisogno dei cambiamenti culturali e strutturali che ho appena descritto continueremo certo a litigare sulle pensioni o sulla riforma del mercato del lavoro ma anche lopposizione dovrebbe riconoscere che quella la direzione poi possiamo competere sulla coerenza rispetto agli obiettivi
5170500 you have underemployed and highly trained musicians actors dancers and other artists who could easily provide arts education to our schools
5170501 artists represent one of the major occupations in the american economy
5170502 the modern building is no longer just a work of plastic art instead with the aid of technological means a range of functional economic social and urban development requirements combined with artistic intention are formed into a whole by the architect tracing this process is one of the most important tasks of an architectural photographer
5170503 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5170504 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5170505 president musharraf is not going to saudi arabia or any other country and he will fight impeachment constitutionally
5170506 those account of muhammad and islam which were published in europe before the beginning of 19th century are now to be regarded as literary curiosities
5170507 so the bottom line is if we keep winning well be okay
5170508 this is better than triple a when i played it
5170509 no matter where you come from its a whole different game than where you played before i came out here with things to learn and im getting better at going out there and getting it done
5170510 sometimes guys come in and try to do too much and be more than who they are
5170511 but jesse has come in and grabbed a hold of a lot of things that our organization would like pitchers to do his last several outings have been fantastic and hes done nothing but just get outs and give us big innings when weve needed them hes done a phenomenal job and been fantastic to work with
5170512 i remember my teammates the feedback telling me that he was a great kid in the clubhouse and that made me feel proud as a dad that i did my job
5170513 i hear from the guys here now in the clubhouse now that hes a professional that jesses fun in the clubhouse and a very humble kid having a great time
5170514 it kind of hit me thats kind of cool that our dads both won the world series together in 86
5170515 i told you 19 wins first ive got to get to 19
5170516 i still have work to do still got six weeks to play its been quite a few years since ive been at 16 and its still august so hopefully i could get a few more before the season is over to be at 16 already means ive been doing some things right
5170517 itll come if he continues to pitch the way hes pitching
5170518 hes had a great season its something thats a possibility
5170519 no question if we dont were not going to win and thats what it comes down to
5170520 yeah i think 3 4 5 in the lineup has to come up big we havent lately but today we did
5170521 it was nice they got off to a three run lead and it was important for us to answer the call
5170522 zij verzoenden zich met het lot zij hadden immers het gevoel dat zij het voor het land hadden gedaan zij hadden hun trots als troost ook wij hadden voor japan gediend maar ineens werd ons japannerschap onze identiteit ons land afgenomen
5170523 its much easier to go from track to triathlon versus triathlon to track
5170524 there is a learning curve to this and you need to put in the time
5170525 youre warming up in too big of a gear and then your legs are toast
5170526 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps
5170527 empty condom packet amp a photo of the tarts knickers
5170528 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5170529 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5170530 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5170531 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5170532 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5170533 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5170534 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5170535 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5170536 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5170537 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5170538 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5170539 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5170540 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5170541 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5170542 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5170543 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5170544 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5170545 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5170546 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5170547 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5170548 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5170549 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5170550 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5170551 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5170552 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5170553 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5170554 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5170555 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5170556 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5170557 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5170558 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

5170597 jika seseorang hadir dalam hidup kamu dan menjadi sebahagian daripada kamu tetapi atas sebab tertentu dia terpaksa pergi jangan terlalu sedih terimalah kenyataan itu dan sekurang kurangnya dia pernah membahagiakan kamu
5170598 kadang kadang allah sembunyikan matahari dia datangkan petir dan kilat kita menangis dan tertanya tanya ke mana hilangnya matahari rupa rupanya allah hendak memberi kita pelangi
5170599 jelas amalan meramal membaca dan menaruh sikit rasa yakin apa dikatakan ramalan bintang itu perlu dijauhi mulai hari ini ini bukan perkara main main atau seronok seronok kerana ia bercanggah dengan hukum islam
5170600 sesiapa yang datang kepada dukun kemudian dia membenarkan terhadap apa yang dikatakan olehnya maka solat orang itu tidak diterima allah selama 40 hari
5170601 jika tidak percaya atau untuk suka suka kenapa hingga melanggan sms horoskop maknanya bangun pagi kita mahu tengok apa yang diramalkan untuk kita hari itu begitu juga dengan membaca di akhbar dan majalah kenapa kita hendak tahu ramalan
5170602 jika katanya dalam bab rezeki apa yang diperoleh tidak setanding kerja dilakukan maka akan timbul perasaan malas buat kerja sebab rezeki yang dapat sikit saja kesan ramalan ini bukan saja pada akidah juga aspek psikologi
5170603 daripada suka suka itu juga apabila kebetulan perkara diramalkan itu benar berlaku ia mula menerbitkan kepercayaan yang akhirnya menyebabkan mereka jatuh ke lembah kepercayaan perkara karut marut ini
5170604 jika allah tidak izinkan perkara itu berlaku ia tidak akan jadi tukang ramal pusinglah daun terup atau biarlah burung dia bercakap tetapi tanpa izin allah tidak akan berlaku malangnya kita tengok zaman moden ramai yang kembali percaya dan mencari petunjuk daripada zodiak
5170605 contohnya bintang capricorn untuk mereka yang lahir 22 disember hingga 20 januari ikut mitos yunani ialah lambang kambing kambing itu bernama almateus dan pernah beri air pada dewa zeus iaitu dewa tertinggi bagi bangsa kuno ketika kecil
5170606 oleh itu bagi mengenang jasa kambing itu ia dijadikan bintang dan bercahaya di langit kesimpulannya capricorn itu kambing saja di sini pun banyak kambing tidak perlu tengok ke langit umat islam perlu renung sejenak adakah bintang ini sesuai dengan peribadi muslim
5170607 sesuai ke jika umat islam percaya kepada bintang kambing biri biri atau lambang orang lelaki gagah tuang air dalam tempayan besar sedangkan banyak perkara lain lebih bermanfaat yang boleh kita fikirkan

5170611 jika seseorang hadir dalam hidup kamu dan menjadi sebahagian daripada kamu tetapi atas sebab tertentu dia terpaksa pergi jangan terlalu sedih terimalah kenyataan itu dan sekurang kurangnya dia pernah membahagiakan kamu
5170612 kadang kadang allah sembunyikan matahari dia datangkan petir dan kilat kita menangis dan tertanya tanya ke mana hilangnya matahari rupa rupanya allah hendak memberi kita pelangi
5170613 sekiranya kamu ingin menghindari keburukan kamu mesti mengetahui kejahatan itu supaya senang kamu menghindarinya
5170614 pernahkah kamu melihat orang yang menjadikan hawa nafsunya sebagai tuhan allah membiarkan mereka sesat dalam keadaan berilmu lalu allah mengunci mati pendengaran dan hatinya

5170619 kadang kadang allah sembunyikan matahari dia datangkan petir dan kilat kita menangis dan tertanya tanya ke mana hilangnya matahari rupa rupanya allah hendak memberi kita pelangi
5170620 perempuan dikahwini atas empat perkara kerana hartanya keturunannya ke cantikannya dan agamanya pilihlah perempuan yang ber agama nescaya kamu akan diberkati allah
5170621 apabila kamu didatangi sesiapa yang kamu boleh menerima agamanya dan akhlaknya kamu mesti membenarkannya mengahwini anak perempuan kamu jika kamu tidak berbuat demikian nescaya satu fitnah besar akan berlaku di bumi serta menjadi keburukan dan kerosakan yang berleluasa
5170622 jangan dekati tum buhan hijau di tempat kotor lalu bertanyalah kalangan pendengar kepada rasulullah apa dia tumbuhan hijau di tempat kotor wahai rasulullah baginda menjawab pe rempuan cantik yang membesar di rumah yang penuh kejahatan serta keburukan
5170623 janganlah menikah dengan kaum kerabat kerana anak daripada pernikahan itu akan membesar kurus lemah tubuh badannya dan tidak cerdik
5170624 berkahwinlah dengan orang asing tidak mempunyai tali persaudaraan dan janganlah me ngahwini kaum kerabat sendiri supaya boleh mengelak kelahiran anak yang lemah dan tidak sihat
5170625 kahwinlah anak dara sesungguhnya mereka ini selalu berkata dengan baik lemah lembut kemungkinan kesuburan mereka amat besar mendapat anak kurang tipu helah mereka jujur dan mudah reda dengan yang sedikit
5170626 wahai rasulullah saya jatuh cinta dengan seorang perempuan yang berketurunan baik berkedudukan dan kaya cuma dia tidak boleh beranak adakah boleh saya berkahwin dengannya terus rasulullah s a w melarangnya

5170633 ini adalah insan garisan yang di tengah ini adalah ajal dan ia mengepungnya ini adalah beberapa hal baru garisan yang di sekitarnya ia menggigitnya jika luput terhadapnya ajal ini maka manusia digigit oleh beberapa hal baru ini dan yang ini adalah angan angan beberapa garisan di luar
5170634 tunggulah hari tua nanti sekarang aku mahu kumpulkan harta sebanyak banyaknya supaya senang beribadah di kala tua
5170635 aku sakit tak boleh sembahyang tak wajib puasa zakat dan sedekah pula tak payahlah keluarkan sebab anak aku perlukan rumah dan banyak hutang pula lebih baik hulurkan kepada mereka hartaku ini orang tua yang kedekut akan menerima padah nanti bagaimana jika anak aku tidak mahu memelihara aku ada duit anak pun datang tak ada duit tinggallah aku keseorangan
5170636 dan kamu ragu ragu serta ditipu oleh angan angan kosong sehingga datanglah ketetapan allah dan kamu sudah ditipu terhadap allah oleh syaitan yang amat penipu

5170643 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5170644 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5170645 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5170646 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5170647 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5170648 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5170649 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5170650 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5170651 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5170652 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5170653 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5170654 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5170655 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5170656 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5170657 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5170658 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5170659 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5170660 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5170661 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

5170665 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5170666 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5170667 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5170668 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5170669 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

5170680 dan tuhanmu perintahkan supaya engkau tidak me nyembah melainkan kepadanya dan hendaklah engkau ber buat baik kepada ibu bapa
5170681 dan kami wajibkan manusia berbuat baik kepada kedua ibu bapanya ibunya telah mengandungnya dengan menanggung kelemahan demi kelemahan dari awal mengandung hingga akhir menyusunya dan tempoh menceraikan susunya ialah dalam masa dua tahun dengan yang demikian bersyukurlah kepada ku dan kepada kedua ibu bapamu dan ingatlah kepada akulah jua tempat kembali untuk menerima ba lasan

5170694 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5170695 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5170696 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5170697 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

5170796 when i moved here in 1997 the water was knee deep most of the year
5170797 im against the mine but most people in town are a little cautious about what they say against the mine because they provide the water
5170798 the people who are against it werent here when the mine was running all these years weve had the hope of it reopening
5170799 during the mexican revolution my family came to presidio from ojinaga and in 1917 my grandfather came to shafter to work as the main clerk in the company store where all the miners shopped
5170800 the mine was very dangerous it took strong backs and many people died
5170801 in one way it would be good for jobs for the people i know there will be changes
5170802 no more quiet days and nights but i believe it will be all right
5170803 its going to be different its going to be historic and everyone should come out to vote
5170804 im keeping up some with it this year for some reason maybe because there is a black man running

5170809 in view of certain developments a decision has been taken that fiji will not attend the forum meeting in niue bainimarama said in a statement today
5170810 this regrettable and unfortunate situation of fiji not participating in the forum meeting in niue arises because of the decision taken by the government of new zealand
5170811 he is trying it on here the bottom line is that there is no forum event in new zealand he said
5170812 trying to blame new zealand for something that doesnt exist is nonsense
5170813 some pacific countries have arranged to have bilateral meetings here that is entirely their business he said
5170814 it obviously came as quite a shock we had a pretty close school group were all pretty close
5170815 its going to rock us pretty hard he was just a good bloke
5170816 he was top notch hhe was a real genuine bloke
5170817 his funeral is going to be absolutely enormous because youd be hard pressed to finding someone who didnt get along well with tom
5170818 tom had been talking about me joining him on this trip for about the last two months
5170819 then he left a message on my facebook telling me he was going down saying sorry about the late notice but im heading down to the snow are you still keen
5170820 i dont check my facebook that regularly and i checked it on saturday and i was like damn i missed out and then this happened
5170821 never shy of a fun time old tommy he was a good social lad
5170822 he was an adventurous one he came up to newcastle not that long ago to do a scuba diving course with his bro and he was big on his skiing
5170823 he was always doing something adventurous he was into rock climbing and any sort of adventure sport
5170824 i know a lot of the boys at the schools were pretty fond of him because he was a young guy that was into rugby and whatnot i think really got on well with the students that didnt get along with other teachers
5170825 yeah we were scribbling notes the entire time and brainstorming answers for john

5170827 assuming you are correct about maos philosophical summation doesnt this say that a conscious grasp of materialist dialectics is unnecessary to proletar ian revolution
5170828 since workers are paid for their labor what is the value of labor
5170829 materialism regards nature as primary and spirit as secondary it places being first and thought second idealism holds the contrary view
5170830 in philosophy generally any system that confines itself to the data of experience and excludes a priori or metaphy sical speculations the basic affirmations of positivism are 1 that all knowledge regard ing matters of fact is based on the positive data of experience and 2 that beyond the realm of fact is that of pure logic and pure mathematics

5170832 while it is not true that this text has been left to the gnawing criticism of the mice by the chinese as was once suspected in the west amp indeed has been published on several occasions as study material for cadres amp academics it is certainly the case that the chinese hold
5170833 communism is the act of positing as the negation of the negation and is hence the actual phase necessary for the next period of historical development in the process of human emanci pation and rehabilitation
5170834 it can therefore be seen that all the laws of formal logic oppose contradictoriness and advocate the characteristic of identity oppose development and change of concepts and things and advocate their solidi fication and immobility this is in direct opposition to dialectics
5170835 why do formal logicians advocate these things because they observe things separate from their continual mutual function and interconnections that is they observe things at rest rath er than in move ment and as separate rather than in connection therefore it is not possible for them to consider and acknowledge the importance of contradictoriness and the negation of the negation within things and concepts and so they advocate the rigid and inflexible law of identity
5170836 electroacupuncture the electrical stimu lation of tissues through acupuncture needles increases the effec tiveness of analgesic pain relieving acupuncture by as much as 100 over traditional acupuncture
5170837 these findings might help explain the results of a study published in the may 4 2005 issue of the
5170838 the results were dramatic the proportion of responders reduction in headache days by at least 50 was 51 in the acupuncture group 53 in the sham acupuncture group amp 15 in the waiting list group
5170839 may be due to nonspecific physiological effects of need ling to a powerful placebo effect or to a combi nation of both in my experience needling where the acupuncturist taps amp twists the flesh embedded needle isnt painful but it is most definitely notice able if acupuncture has effects beyond placebo it is through the physical stimulation amp release of the bodys natural painkillers finding that sham acupuncture is as effective as real acupuncture demon strates that the qi theory is full of holes the effects of being poked by needles however cannot be ignored under standing the psychology amp neurophysiology of acupuncture amp pain will lead to a better theory and for all such alternative medicine claims testimonials can steer us in the direction of where to conduct research science is the only tool that can tell us whether they really work or nor

5170846 if the votes of the superdelegates overturn whats happened in the elections it would be harmful to the democratic party
5170847 weve been strong supporters of the dccc we therefore urge
5170848 that defeats you right there if you understand the math at all that defeats you right there
5170849 whats more if you are part of that 16 percent you need to get up and get the hell out of here right now
5170850 i am a believer in the seniority system i frankly think it is hillarys time
5170851 you dont need all that just put the ball on the truck and go
5170852 speaker pelosi is confident that superdelegates will choose between senators clinton or obama our two strong candidates before the convention in august
5170853 that choice will be based on many considerations including respecting the decisions of millions of americans who have voted in primaries and participated in caucuses the speaker believes it would do great harm to the democratic party if superdelegates are perceived to overturn the will of the voters this has been her position throughout this primary season regardless of who was ahead at any particular point in delegates or votes
5170854 nobody should be writing obituaries on this race because it is a long way from being over
5170855 what ive seen in my last 14 months on the campaign trail is that every time people count me out you know pundits say its over it should be over the voters bring me back because they believe that i will actually get up every day in that white house and work my heart out for all of our people
5170856 because you know when youve been on a campaign for 14 months you know theres all other kinds of distractions but at the end of the day this is like a hiring decision who will people hire to get this country moving in the direction it should move in
5170857 hillary is in this race because of people like you and places like this and no matter what they say
5170858 and no matter how much fun they make of your support of her and the fact that working people all over america have stuck with her she thinks youre as smart as they are she thinks youve got as much right to have your say as anybody else and you know they make a lot of fun of me because i like to campaign in places like this they say i have been exiled to rural america as if that was a problem i dont know about you but id rather be here than listening to that stuff i have to hear on television id rather be with you there is a simple reason you need a president a lot more than those people telling you not to vote for her
5170859 it is very interesting from the very beginning of this race there has been a sharp divide in the vote the people who need a president who need to turn the economy around who need to restore the middle class who need to give poor people a chance to work their way into the middle class who need to give our children a better future who need to restore our standing in the world and the war in iraq but do it in a way that rebuilds our military and stands up for americas security and standing around the world they have been for her from the get go
5170860 she tells the story as it was told to her by the deputy sheriff she had no reason to doubt his word
5170861 if the hospital claims it didnt happen that way we certainly respect that and she wont repeat the story she never mentions the hospital by name and isnt trying to cast blame
5170862 lot of girls too especially on ladies night and a lot of them are better shots than the guys
5170863 some 10 15 soldiers sprayed our car with weapons for at least 4 or 5 minutes i could not move the vehicle since the engine broke down we shouted at the soldiers that we were journalists we also took our t shirts off and waved them out of windows some 4 or 5 minutes later soldiers approached us
5170864 i looked up and i saw kobe and lebron the best basketball players in the world and i love basketball
5170865 i thought theres no way i was going to let those guys down
5170866 he did something thats never been done before were happy to be a part of it
5170867 every single athlete in the world right now needs to tip their hat to michael phelps because what he did this week was amazing

5170869 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
5170870 everything had to go perfect everything had to fall perfectly into place and i was able to have probably the best week of my life
5170871 the fact that ukraine is no longer a party to the 1992 agreement allows it to launch active cooperation with european countries to integrate its information
5170872 the international community is clear that south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the us fully recognises this reality
5170873 excuse me what about you makes you more important than me
5170874 the purpose is to figure out how memories are actually stored in a biological brain
5170875 if we can understand some of the basics of what is going on in our little model brain it could have enormous medical spinoffs
5170876 within about 24 hours they start sending out feelers to each other and making connections
5170877 within a week we get some spontaneous firings and brain like activity
5170878 now we are looking at how best to teach it to behave in certain ways
5170879 this one is a bit boisterous and active while we know another is not going to do what we want it to
5170880 this is a simplified version of what goes on in the human brain where we can look and control the basic features in the way that we want in a human brain you cant really do that
5170881 we have a lock down situation we have cameras but the question we had to answer is what if somebody gets in what are we going to do
5170882 the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe has the russian federation as its aim
5170883 was signed at a time of a very difficult crisis in relations between russia and the us over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
5170884 the us is concerned with its own anti missile defence not polands but poland by deploying the shield will be exposed to attack
5170885 we are now harvesting the fruit of many months of hard work
5170886 made the polish government a little more willing to conclude a deal
5170887 it may also have made the bush administration more willing to meet the polish demands
5170888 is to protect our european allies from any rogue threats such as a missile from iran
5170889 in no way is the missile defense aimed at russia
5170890 were still talking a number of years before any interceptors can actually be deployed and in the meantime youre going to have a new administration that could rethink the whole plan
5170891 obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign

5170907 the housing market the rising prices of everything affects me im on a fixed income
5170908 the only thing we can do is pass it on to the customers we dont like it we dont think its right but we dont have any choice
5170909 youve got the fuel costs going up that affects everybody
5170910 its a valid reason for the increase if thats the case everything i buy for the shop is going up because the fuel surcharge on deliveries is going up who pays for it the lowest guy on the totem pole its passed on to the customer the customer pays for everything

5170918 i really like what i do to be able to interpret for people who need your help
5170919 it requires extreme concentration you pretty much have to be on your game at all times
5170920 what certification provides is a statewide mandate that was lacking
5170921 it was a voluntary process that many interpreters did not avail themselves to
5170922 i will tell her it is ok she is learning
5170923 it gets chaotic covering all the patrols when you have less people
5170924 we do a pretty good job of keeping everything covered
5170925 even when we came out here today we said lets go where they are
5170926 its a great loss to the city as the building was associated with wolverhamptons industrial heritage
5170927 it remains to be seen what the developers will be able to do now perhaps the building can still be salvaged or it may have to be demolished completely
5170928 i couldnt get my train back from birmingham and ended up having to catch a bus
5170929 i had no idea that the problem was here until i arrived and i could see the fire from a long way off
5170930 i was trying to get to the great western pub to meet some friends i couldnt get around because the road was closed off the trains seemed to be getting through but it looked like a huge fire
5170931 the fire went through all five floors and had broken through the roof
5170932 water was something we needed large quantities of and we sent a high volume pumping unit to allow us to draw large quantities of water from the canal
5170933 smoke from the incident affected a nearby railway line and as a consequence we had to ask network rail to switch off the power supply there
5170934 im glad to say there have been no casualties investigations can only take place once the building has been deemed safe to enter
5170935 its going to be dropping a lot of rain and all residents should be on the lookout for that
5170936 make sure they tune into their local weather stations for the most up to date information
5170937 but we looked at 15 different models of the storm and only one model shows it coming here
5170938 if there is any chance it might come in this direction then we wouldnt send any teams to help with power outages well need them here

5170941 i believe that every right implies a responsibility every opportunity an obligation every possession a duty
5170942 i will not be distracted by this malicious campaign it is a dirty campaign orchestrated using religion and the koran by the last people who can claim to be moral
5170943 i have seen the first medical report and i am privy to the second report and based on that they have no case against me
5170944 for us muslims this is important no one can lie swearing on the koran
5170945 the reason i enlarged the toys to such an enormous size is to highlight the political economic system behind them dinosaur toys are designed by some company from a western country and produced in china then commercially distributed to the whole globe it is the result of transnational capitalist production
5170946 the 400 guys got us up for the 200 thats usas event even though theres someone called bolt

5170951 of the four people on board the aircraft there were two males and two females three of them were highly experienced full commercial pilots two people were operating the flight and the third pilot was assisting in the back with survey work with a highly skilled survey engineer
5170952 its a very difficult time because we are a very small company a family kind of company its an absolute tragedy that they should have been killed while doing this routine work
5170953 sadly there was nothing that could be done other than the grim task of confirming the deaths of the five people
5170954 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
5170955 there are so many emotions going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
5170956 without the help of my team mates this isnt possible
5170957 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
5170958 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5170959 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous

5170964 dieser punkt ist in meinen augen nicht verhandelbar er muss alle russischen streitkr fte betreffen die seit dem 7 august nach georgien gekommen sind
5170965 ich bekomme mehr und mehr das gef hl dass der alt bundeskanzler ein gest rtes verh ltnis zu seiner fr heren bet tigung hat sobald russland ins spiel kommt ist sein urteil in h chstem ma e unverh ltnism ig und unangemessen
5170966 schr der ist mittlerweile die prominenteste stimme moskaus in deutschland
5170967 eine einseitige schuldzuweisung frei nach dem motto wes brot ich ess des lied ich sing dem altkanzler ist offenbar die au enpolitische weitsicht abhandengekommen
5170968 er schw cht die position des westens und erweist der sache der menschenrechte und des v lkerrechts einen b rendienst wer f r gazprom arbeitet sollte k nftig bei themen die russland betreffen besser schweigen
5170969 die strategische partnerschaft zwischen deutschland und russland muss gr ndlich berpr ft werden sie stammt noch aus zeiten von rot gr n durch die gro machtpolitik moskaus ist eine neue lage entstanden

5170973 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5170974 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5170975 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5170976 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5170977 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5170978 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5170979 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5170980 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5170981 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5170982 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5170983 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5170984 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5170985 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5170986 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5170987 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5170988 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5170989 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5170990 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5170991 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5170992 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5170993 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5170994 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta

5170996 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo

5171000 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5171001 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5171002 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5171003 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5171004 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5171005 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5171006 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5171007 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

5171018 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5171019 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios

5171026 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5171027 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5171028 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5171029 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
5171030 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

5171035 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte

5171041 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte

5171044 im happy for crouch because now he can play more games
5171045 when i was first talking with xabi about a transfer we needed money after these months it is not a question of money we would have to have a massive offer because alonso is a great player
5171046 but if we sell one or two players we have enough money to bring in one more good player
5171047 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5171048 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion

5171052 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5171053 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5171054 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5171055 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5171056 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5171057 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5171058 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5171059 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5171060 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5171061 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena

5171069 francoise mbango does not respect cameroon she has dragged cameroon through the mud on numerous occasions
5171070 i dont know if i had to obtain the permission of the athletics federation or that of ange sama before having a baby this is insulting
5171071 francoise mbango does not respect cameroon she has rubbed cameroon in mud on numerous occasions
5171072 i dont know if i had to obtain the permission of the athletics federation or that of ange sama before having a baby it is inhuman to demand that a female athlete an olympic champion for that matter who takes a break from competition and returns after giving birth be brought before a disciplinary commission it is insulting
5171073 in spite of the blatant indiscipline of the athlete mbango etone fran oise her contempt for the cameroon athletics federation the national olympics committee and government authorities
5171074 we should not get into a power struggle with government
5171075 there were a number of times where the boks were unlucky not to score if they had scored on one of those occasions the whole game probably would have turned there are a lot of positives that the boks will be taking out of that game the loss will just really spur them on to a better performance this weekend south africa are the world champions and are an extremely proud rugby nation
5171076 south africa get tremendous support they just rise to the occasion when they play at home we have been extremely close a number of times i have been involved in games where we were defeated after the bell we had a very narrow loss last year at newlands so thats the challenge for us
5171077 south africa certainly had opportunities in the second half when they were pressing against the all black line they obviously turned the ball over and lost quite convincingly
5171078 but had those turning points gone the other way and had percy montgomery maybe kicked a couple of those kicks the game would certainly have been a lot closer than what it ended up being
5171079 hi emily which one do you think is more cute

5171103 software project managers are more likely to succeed if they use techniques that are more like managing a move production than an engineering production
5171104 professionals who regularly create a unique and complex web of intellectual property limited only by vision and creativity
5171105 a software managers day to day decisions like those of a movie producer are dominated by value judgments cost trade offs human factors macro economic tends technology trends market strengths and timing
5171106 look our bad that was not the way to do that one
5171107 youre going to have expertise in your team were not going to be even in the middle so that way you can invest the expertise for what you need and were not holding you up or bringing you into a slower position
5171108 thank you very much for coming up with a slogan that takes the pressure off what weve done
5171109 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
5171110 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
5171111 a lot of our customers like the ubuntu desktop and use it for software development now they want to roll it out to the server we want to make sure that when they roll out ubuntu on the server they find it equally joyous
5171112 we want to make it as easy to install software on the ubuntu server as it is to for example were getting ready to release db2 and informix database management systems that come as deb packages which will install and do basic set up with only a couple of clicks or a single command line instruction
5171113 when alfresco releases alfresco enterprise release 3 later this year we will make the entire enterprise solution available through the canonical store
5171114 when it is released in a few weeks we will be offering the zimbra collaboration suite 5 5 later this year which will be a big boon for our corporate users
5171115 we see ubuntu part of a larger trend toward fragmentation of the linux market linux itself isnt fragmenting but we see other companies besides red hat and novell moving up with canonical being so hot on the desktop and pushing hard on the server we think the desktop will work in their favor
5171116 perhaps canonical could jump over servers i could see a

5171121 i think ssds will compete against express and the standard edition but for now ssds is targeting a different audience
5171122 the good thing about ssds is you dont have to worry about backup storage performance availability etc which i think is great for smbs or small applications

5171140 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
5171141 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
5171142 since women having abortions can no longer be said to have a low risk of suffering from psychiatric conditions such as depression doctors have a duty to advise about long term adverse psychological consequences of abortion
5171143 we now know that abortion leads to depression and mental health problems in later life along with other complications in future pregnancies
5171144 abortion research is highly politicised but large high quality studies consistently show that having an abortion does not result in psychological damage

5171153 racist organizations right wing militias nra life members and above all those who hate a conversation with mahmoud ahmadinejad charlie rose light and darkness with no white people a racist cast you have expressed a very elitist tone that given your feelings ive repeatedly voiced my disdain for the homophobic mccain loves dance music talkleft the politics of crime is the church homophobic you say everyone uses the terms its also elitist and irrational graham veale complain portrays cannot fairly be seen as the anti gay misogynist of woman in charge women who charge judith warner domestic perhaps your elitist attitude is clouding your judgment or one sign of his misogynism and i resent both his misogynist guilty racists

5171156 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5171157 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5171158 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5171159 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5171160 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5171169 the national enquirer gives the story cooties for all the times and boston globes the washington posts of the world that is partly because thirty years forty fifty years ago the national enquirer was very different than today it is this low brow celebrity scandal mongering thing

5171183 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners as he waited head down he felt a presence slowly he looked up and saw a skinny old prisoner squat down beside him the man said nothing instead he used a stick to trace in the dirt the sign of the cross the man then got back up and returned to his work as solzhenitsyn stared at the cross drawn in the dirt his entire perspective changed he knew he was only one man against the all powerful soviet empire yet he knew there was something greater than the evil he saw in the prison camp something greater than the soviet union he knew that hope for all people was represented by that simple cross through the power of the cross anything was possible solzhenitsyn slowly rose to his feet picked up his shovel and went back to work outwardly nothing had changed inside he had received hope

5171204 we worked hard every day but the result was as you see and its really hard to take
5171205 in watching warmups we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5171206 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5171207 a 110 meter hurdles race without liu is such a pity
5171208 but they will understand when somebody has an accident you cant help it
5171209 the track is perfect anything is possible in the final
5171210 not getting it up and down on 11 kind of ticked me off

5171212 mit ihren derzeitigen aktivit ten werden parteien und politiker im internet kaum eine stimme gewinnen
5171213 twitter ist das schnellste medium von allen das mobile internet wird es noch mehr pushen microblogging ist definitiv gekommen um zu bleiben
5171214 es gab noch nie so viele b rgerinitiativen wie heute sie nutzen extrem stark das internet ohne diese vernetzung k nnten sie berregional nicht diese ausstrahlung entwickeln das w re undenkbar
5171215 te cuento algo que estoy pensando uribe v lez est esperando a ver qui n gana la presidencia de estados unidos para resolver 2 su presencia en la oea u otro puesto por esos lados
5171216 es bueno que comiencen a mirar a los lados otras posibilidades otros liderazgos en nuestro partido hay gente valiosa tenemos a dos ministros juan manuel santos de defensa y scar iv n zuluaga de hacienda quienes han hecho una gran labor
5171217 en el desayuno el presidente habl de que aproximadamente en unos tres o cuatro meses el pa s conocer dicha decisi n
5171218 non avvicinarti ho letto che se una ti morde fa un male incredibile
5171219 si esta cl usula del acuerdo de alto el fuego no se aplicase r pida y totalmente tendr a que convocar un consejo europeo extraordinario para decidir sobre las consecuencias a sacar
5171220 este punto no es negociable a mi juicio debe afectar a todas las fuerzas rusas que entraron en georgia desde el 7 de agosto
5171221 mucho que hacer para estabilizar la situaci n de forma duradera
5171222 tambi n deberemos determinar si la intervenci n de rusia contra su vecino georgiano ha sido una respuesta brutal y excesiva en este caso singular o si inaugura un nuevo endurecimiento de mosc hacia sus vecinos y hacia toda la comunidad internacional lo que inevitablemente tendr a consecuencias en su relaci n con la uni n europea
5171223 el interior de la provincia rebelde osetia del sur en la noche del 7 al 8 de agosto
5171224 aporte una contribuci n responsable y constructiva al arreglo de los problemas de nuestro tiempo

5171226 string of storms 2007 snow in seattle and even with a possible broken toe i ventured out to cross some items off the ol christmas list
5171227 you are never going to see these people again who cares go in already
5171228 the president will address the nation at 07 00 gmt
5171229 he is a wise man he is a very experienced man and he has seen the writing on the wall
5171230 he has seen the sentiments of not just the elected representatives but various institutions who all asked him to move in a particular way and do not destabilise things here
5171231 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behaviour characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5171232 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5171233 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5171234 georgia will never give up a square kilometre of its territory
5171235 it was the same pistol with which he shot mossie dead
5171236 im angry at the man who took him mossie away
5171237 im very happy to be number one but the feeling doesnt change too much because the last years i did very well too
5171238 i was very happy being the number two so finally im number one for sure theres satisfaction but at the same time i dont know i dont have time to celebrate i play new york in one week
5171239 i just want to enjoy this moment because im having an unbelievable year
5171240 its more than my best dreams so i want to enjoy the moment i know how difficult it is to win these things especially here winning for me is unbelievable
5171241 it looks easy but when youre running a lot you get a little bit tired you get a little bit dizzy
5171242 i was expecting like a passing shot to the other side
5171243 you know im going to keep remember the next two points that i missed easy balls normally if im playing good im not going to miss those but it can happen
5171244 thats what i expected and hoped for many years ago when i got to number one that if ever somebody were to take it away from me he would have to play an incredible tennis schedule win the biggest tournaments dominate the game basically and then like this he can take number one
5171245 i dont want to be the vice president i am not going to be the nominee
5171246 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5171247 if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5171248 i hate to disappoint you but nothing to report today
5171249 i dont have anything for you on the vice presidential front
5171250 without a doubt the springboks wont want to suffer again at home and at kings park they are playing at one of their favoured destinations
5171251 its hard for the springboks now to win the tri nations but you know how they will respond they are the world champions and there is no way they will be contemplating another loss
5171252 both sides had a huge level of intensity and it was only late in the match when it got away from the springboks that they were forced to play a game they werent comfortable with
5171253 being there and observing it at the arena it was very evident that any side that enters a tri nations match not at full noise is just going to get belted and while the score probably appears to be one sided the contest itself was very much anything but that
5171254 the first half was probably the biggest indicator of that there was an awful lot of rugby played in that first half but little to show for it as indicated by it being 5 0 at half time
5171255 the all blacks played well by absorbing that pressure and took the points when on offer even if not with the boot
5171256 este tema para mi para pedir hoy en m xico unos juegos ol mpicos antes de hacerlo hay que estudiarlo volverlo a estudiar y volverlo a estudiar porque no me gusta que m xico pierda y si hoy m xico se lanza sin estudiar bien el tema pierde

5171261 me coment que se acercar a formalmente con el com y a su vez con el coi
5171262 la importancia de que sea un grupo ciudadano el que impulse esta iniciativa y sean ellos los que solicitan el apoyo de legisladores autoridades de gobierno y de municipio es para evitar situaciones de ndole pol tico por los cambios de administraciones gubernamentales

5171277 absolutely hes too old how many 72 year olds do you know who can work a 60 hour week
5171278 dads a happy go lucky guy whos enjoying himself thats what mccain should be doing
5171279 i see mccain showing his age i think one reason his wife stands in back of him all the time is to tell him what to say
5171280 i dont like the idea of his being 80 at the end of his second term
5171281 as people get up in age they get sick more often and mccain has had cancer
5171282 i know someone who was old at 40 she thought like an older person
5171283 my grandmas 93 and her cousin lived to be 105
5171284 now think of all that stuff john mccain went through in vietnam
5171285 he is speaking at the exact same time and exact same day that it became law by a real president
5171286 where ever he speaks we are going to let him know how we feel
5171287 under the present set up because weve mortgaged our childrens futures you will not have social security benefits that present day retirees have unless we fix it and americans have got to understand that we are paying present day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in american today and thats a disgrace its an absolute disgrace and its got to be fixed
5171288 its the right thing to do and hopefully we can get this social security issue turned around and if not we tried
5171289 the frustration and delay the dhbs have imposed on this process will no longer be tolerated by junior doctors it is time for the dhbs to prioritise this negotiation
5171290 their new position still equates to over 7 percent a year which is unaffordable and well beyond other settlements in the health sector
5171291 what message would that send to the other 57 000 employees and unions who have worked with dhbs to agree cooperative and forward looking settlements and partnership agreements

5171298 im not qualified to give you anything like a critique but holy crap monica that sounded really good to me
5171299 i didnt realize anyone was home i thought i would have another hour or two to practice before anybody returned ill stop
5171300 dont stop on my account i love listening to you i might ask you to play something else
5171301 yeah ok before your time i guess early rock and roll stars
5171302 i havent been allowed to study that yet they want me to stay with classical and pieces written specifically for piano besides thats what master likes so thats what i want to be able to play
5171303 im not ready i dont want to sound terrible and have him think this is a waste of time and money
5171304 you dont have to worry about that not with the way youre playing right now
5171305 please leave i wish to be alone with your master
5171306 i got lonely i have needs that havent been fulfilled in far too long and why should monica and viv have all the fun
5171307 since youre the only man here you get the job of seeing to my needs
5171308 would thee lady prefer to be ravished here or in the bedroom
5171309 ummm bedroom i think its more comfortable there and better suited to all night sessions
5171310 presumptuous little wench arent you what makes you think i havent selected another sla uhhh woman as my bedmate for the night
5171311 but if you have i will claw both hers and your eyes out in my frustration at being denied
5171312 evil woman you are having such nasty inclinations intemperate words such as those warrant strenuous chastisement no matter how toothsome the wench who says them its bad enough that you would think to attack me but for you to turn on a poor helpless slave also is reprehensible
5171313 i suppose youre right shameful of me to even think of punishing a slave for your failings i deserve to be punished for that alone
5171314 i cannot give you the whipping i would like to that pleasure must wait until you are more fully recovered
5171315 if you feel you are incapable of providing the appropriate intensity of punishment that i desire i know a doctor who will be more than willing to do so
5171316 i didnt mean that quite the way it sounded as long as you dont whip me directly on the wound ill be fine
5171317 do you mean that if i keep doing what i was doing you will cum
5171318 you should have remembered that you dont cum until i say you may that should help you remember
5171319 ill remember i swear i will you dont have to give me any more reminders i promise
5171320 are you ready to cum do you want me to make you cum
5171321 you must beg properly beg correctly and i will give you permission but if you cum before i permit you to i will be forced to punish you
5171322 while others may be bigger nobody serves the customer better

5171332 the battlefield was littered with the dead and dying from each side
5171333 oh yeah we forgot to tell you about the fire ants
5171334 hey why dont you find me a bike like that
5171335 i was for hillary but now im kind of undecided
5171336 yeah but i think i might go with mccain its just that well i dont know you know
5171337 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me
5171338 the not altogether surprising backlash from mccains campaign is a deflection an expression of deep discomfort
5171339 white students see diversity as a potential source of individual enhancement
5171340 most of the white students dont have to think twice about how much it costs to take prep classes for the lsat or to spend spring break skiing in aspen or partying in canc n
5171341 but i work for liberal causes youre lumping me with racists just because im white
5171342 im not saying that you personally are a racist im saying we live in a world where its easier to be white than it is to be black
5171343 small circle of poets and conscious do gooders are not enough
5171344 the resistance of the civil rights generation to obamas candidacy signified the failure of their parents to come to terms at the dusk of their lives with the success of their own struggle to embrace the idea that black politics might now be disappearing into american politics in the same way that the irish and italian machines joined the political mainstream
5171345 im the new black politics the people i work with are the new black politics we dont carry around that history we see the world through post civil rights eyes i dont mean that disrespectfully but thats just the way it is
5171346 barack obama is the sum of their struggle hes the sum of their tears their fights their marching their pain this opportunity is the sum of that
5171347 this is just a pull back otherwise the trend is bearish

5171350 here we are all of a sudden in the 60th year after strom thurmond bolting the democratic party over a simple thing something almost unheard of because he did not want the armed forces to be integrated
5171351 here we are 45 years after the i have a dream speech forty years after the assassinations of kennedy and king and this party that i have been a part of for so long this party that has been accused of taking black people for granted is about to deliver the nomination for the nations highest office to an african american how do you describe that all those days in jail cells wondering if anything you were doing was even going to have an impact
5171352 but ive got a head too and in the beginning my head was with clinton the conventional wisdom was that this thing was going to be over in february
5171353 youd be real embarrassed if he won and you wasnt down with it
5171354 conversations like those i had with clyburn and lewis however begin to illuminate just how emotionally complicated such internal deliberations were
5171355 if anybody tells you they expected this result theyre not being honest with you
5171356 of course i would support someone i knew and had liked and had worked with versus someone id never heard of
5171357 every kid is always talking about what his parents have been through
5171358 and no kid has any clue what hes talking about
5171359 but now i realize had i been given the opportunity what i could have been and im about to die
5171360 the people i work with are the new black politics we dont carry around that history we see the world through post civil rights eyes i dont mean that disrespectfully but thats just the way it is
5171361 i dont want in any way to seem critical of the generation of leadership who fought so i could be sitting here
5171362 barack obama is the sum of their struggle hes the sum of their tears their fights their marching their pain this opportunity is the sum of that
5171363 but its like watching something that youve been working on all your life sort of come together right before your eyes and you cant see it
5171364 its like youve been building the great wall of china and you finally put that last stone in and you cant see it you just cant see the enormity of it
5171365 he should keep hope alive and any personal attacks and insults to himself
5171366 but youve got to learn one basic lesson youre trying to start at the top and you cant start at the top in politics
5171367 i dont think a group with 435 members can be the top of anything
5171368 race was a factor in the contest between obama and clinton
5171369 theres no question race will be a factor with obama and mccain but im not sure it plays out as neatly as people think theres no question that some young cohort of white voters were drawn to obama because they like the idea of a break with the past a young white politician from illinois might not have gotten that support so race probably cost obama some votes and it probably won him some votes thats the complex reality were living in
5171370 you know what its like growing up every single day and having people ask to touch your hair because theyve never seen hair like that
5171371 to have the entire class laugh and giggle when somebody pronounces niger as nigger the constant bombardment of that kind of thing really affects your spirit and its every single day like when people want to come back from a vacation and compare their tan to yours and joke about being black
5171372 i dont want people to expect me to speak about those issues
5171373 i want people to ask me about nonproliferation i want them to run to me to speak about the situation in the middle east
5171374 i dont want to be the person thats turned to when cnn talks about black leaders
5171375 so obamas the first one out there on the ice
5171376 this campaign is giving other african americans like myself the courage to be themselves
5171377 there was an arrogance and a complete dismissiveness in our campaign against obama that he was a lightweight that he couldnt get black support
5171378 a lot of the black leaders didnt know him didnt think he was black enough didnt think he was of the civil rights movement
5171379 internal polling in both campaigns after iowa showed obama suddenly garnering closer to 75 or 80 percent of the black vote in primary states
5171380 i grew up in the south where men like barack obama who right now is older than bill clinton was when he ran for president were called boy
5171381 there was something about the condescension on his face when he said it and the dismissiveness in his voice
5171382 the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away nor has the anger and bitterness of those years at times that anger is exploited by politicians to gin up votes along racial lines or to make up for a politicians own failings
5171383 in the context of what i do for a living ive not figured out a black or white way to fill a pothole
5171384 i think there was a lot of sensitivity some warranted and some unwarranted
5171385 its based on your life experience and its generational you know if you have a sore on your arm you dont necessarily have to touch the sore to feel the pain you can touch another part of your arm youve still got a certain sensitivity to it so if race is the sensitive thing then anything that even gets close to it sounds like it looks like it feels like it is it
5171386 you guys told me it was a skin condition i thought i was talking to a brother
5171387 look i never asked anybody to be for me because i was black
5171388 i asked people to be for me because i thought i was the best candidate when i ran for city council and when i ran for mayor im proud of the votes i received im proud i received the votes of the majority of the african american community and the majority of the vote from the white community but i never asked anybody to give me anything because i was black i asked people to give me a chance because i thought i was the best
5171389 its presumptuous it demonstrates a continuation of this notion that the african american community unlike any other is completely monolithic that everyone in the african american community does the same thing in lockstep in contrast to any other group i mean i dont remember seeing john kerry on tv and anybody saying to him i cant believe youre not for hillary clinton why
5171390 the challenge there is never forgetting where you came from
5171391 so yes i am mayor of all philadelphia but i am quite well aware of and raise on a regular basis the fact that the majority of people who are killed in philadelphia are african american that the overwhelming majority of people who have health care challenges are african american that education has tremendous disparity gaps unemployment incarceration poverty homelessness housing all affect the african american community at a disproportionate level as opposed to everyone else
5171392 this isnt a struggle that began in the 1930s or 1960s its a struggle that began in 1620 its a struggle against slavery and its children
5171393 one of the things i talk to clients about is that the digital divide has changed
5171394 its no longer along racial lines like it was in 1996 and 2000 now its more economic and educational
5171395 things are changing from where they were 30 years ago the fights are changing and you have an infrastructure thats not producing results look at the incarceration rates the difference between whites and blacks what are the old organizations accomplishing
5171396 there are some members who need to go or to update and be accountable
5171397 its not about getting rid of the n a a c p or our members of congress its just wanting to be proud of our leaders
5171398 shes poised to be one of the most influential people in politics and particularly among african americans in politics
5171399 even as we continue to defend affirmative action as a useful if limited tool to expand opportunity to underrepresented minorities we should consider spending a lot more of our political capital convincing america to make investments needed to ensure that all children perform at grade level and graduate from high school a goal that if met would do more than affirmative action to help those black and latino children who need it the most
5171400 if obama is president it will no longer be tenable to go to the white community and say youve been victimized
5171401 and i understand the poverty and the condition of black america and the 39 percent unemployment rate in some communities i understand that but if you go out to the country and say youve been victimized by the white community while barack obama and michelle and their kids are living in the white house you will be shut off from having any influence
5171402 its a very interesting question but as a black person you should feel confident that he will focus on your injustices and know that all the other injustices in other communities affect you too
5171403 there have been wounds in all the communities not just in the black community there are plenty of wounds to go around
5171404 youre constantly tested by a whole host of factors to see whether youre speaking for the entire commonwealth or just for one community
5171405 i dont fit in any box and i think thats what the electorate has had to learn about me
5171406 yes but its not good enough for me to have the reaction that you just did to say im the governor not the mayor
5171407 you wouldnt believe how many times in the last few days people have stuck microphones in my face to ask my opinion about jesse jacksons comments
5171408 all i have to be is as good a human being and as good a governor as i can be and the rest will take care of itself
5171409 i grew up in sort of a neighborhood like this in atlanta ga
5171410 there could be some supply disruption issues there so the market is watching this closely

5171414 well i think it was pretty obvious that we have a lot of work to do based on tonight really in all three phases of the game i didnt think we played as well or competitively as were capable of playing certainly its a lot of little things but those little things add up to big things starting with me we all have to do a better job well see another good team this week against philadelphia and hopefully we can get a little better performance than that
5171415 im sure there were positives out there for everybody and im sure there were negatives for everybody so well look at the tape and evaluate that we got some experience against a good team against a fast team against a playoff team like i said there are a lot of things that we need to do
5171416 we believe that 95 percent is the minimally acceptable probability of success for a given initial withdrawal rate

5171423 i dont find any basis to conclude there was negligent or reckless conduct to the extent criminal charges are appropriate
5171424 but i think someone needs to put a plan in place for the future statewide whenever there is any digging for road construction
5171425 fails even to adequately identify the statutes under which plaintiffs purport to sue for the alleged publicity violations
5171426 the alleged use of the intellectual property is not a trademark use and it is impossible for plaintiffs to establish consumer confusion upper deck attorneys stated
5171427 as long as there is a lower class i am in it as long as there is a criminal element i am of it as long as there is a soul in prison i am not free
5171428 thats a slogan we have been using for more than a decade
5171429 even if you fast forward through the spot you get that very definite message
5171430 in the future maybe we put kellie burns bio in there perhaps we put more details on a news story that we are promoting people could stop the commercial and get more information than in the regular 30 second promo
5171431 i dont think so i dont think that that is the intent of it by any means
5171432 subliminal messages have a negative connotation that you are trying to trick people truly all the images you see and all the words you see we are trying to strive for a very positive message in them

5171451 we will also create within the framework of this calendar a ranking system for individual riders teams and nations
5171452 the electorate has a right to have politicians who are informed about subjects that are important to the electorate and its clear that our politicians dont even have a basic knowledge of what theyre talking about when it comes our classification system when it comes to videogames when it comes to emerging media theyre deeply uninformed and they dont seem to be the slightest bit interested in learning and when we have that level of ignorance in our parliaments thats a situation that for me really is terrifying
5171453 i have to say that ive never met or heard from an australian politician that is substantially across gaming and i think thats fairly disappointing
5171454 they may be out there but its certainly not high on their agenda to get the classification scheme fixed its certainly not high on their agenda to get real respect and recognition for this growing media and growing industry in australia
5171455 dont understand that people from all walks of life are enjoying gaming just as they enjoy cinema television or music

5171498 the timing significant there have been reports that there is a heavy amount of security at the airport and that an aircraft was on the tarmac and that the president might resign
5171499 he is a wise man he is a very experienced man and he has seen the writing on the wall
5171500 he has seen the sentiments of not just the elected representatives but various institutions who all asked him to move in a particular way and do not destabilise things here
5171501 if he fails to decide to quit within the next two days the impeachment process will take its course
5171502 political fate has been sealed whatever he says to the nation doesnt matter

5171515 when it comes to testicular cancer our health is quite literally in our hands
5171516 there is a very high success rate of treatment for testicular cancer if its caught early enough
5171517 self examination is crucial and i hope that these shower cards and posters will help remind men to have a quick check after a game work out or shower
5171518 testicular cancer does not have to kill it can be treated if caught in time
5171519 with 100 men being diagnosed every year with this form of cancer its clear that there is a great deal more that we can do to remind young men to regularly examine themselves
5171520 by circulating posters and shower cards throughout leisure centres and sporting organisations in wales we hope to raise awareness of this important issue

5171553 se es el t pico nivel de los equipos espa oles no son fuertes al ataque usan mucho topspin efecto curvado y no nos gusta ese estilo nos complica el resto cuando perdimos as en roland garros intentamos aprender la lecci n y aplicar diferentes estrategias para responder a esa t ctica no tenemos ni buenas experiencias ni capacidad de respuesta contra eso

5171560 mis mejores recuerdos corresponden a mis momentos fuera de la piscina con mis compa eros ahora mismo veo cada una de las carreras cada instante no quiero olvidarme de nada de lo que me ha pasado
5171561 si no hubiera sido nadador habr a vivido en el mundo real
5171562 con un trabajo normal en el que probablemente no dar a la talla como nadador creo que he puesto a este deporte en otra rbita al menos en estados unidos me han dicho que en el estadio de los ravens 70 000 personas vieron la final del relevo he escuchado que hicieron un anuncio en el de los yankees cuando gan los 100 mariposa ha sido una locura
5171563 me gustar a acortar el repertorio y dedicarme a las carreras de 100 metros
5171564 pero bob bowman su entrenador y descubridor no est muy entusiasmado
5171565 la federaci n hizo un plan al principio de la temporada quien ha querido ha participado en l quien no ha querido no yo he tenido respeto pero no me lo han devuelto todo lo que me han pedido se lo he dado

5171598 los neum ticos han sido un desastre en mi vida hab a sentido tanta verg enza como en esta carrera
5171599 y lo peor de todo es que no reconocen los errores y adem s son arrogantes no aceptan que tienen un problema
5171600 que no puedas llegar al final de la carrera con unas m nimas medidas de seguridad es intolerable
5171601 al fin ha llegado material nuevo que me permite disfrutar encima de la moto
5171602 me dej llevar por la confianza y la ambici n si aspiraba a medalla ten a que pasar cualquier prueba
5171603 pero en cambio tal como iba situado no me enteraba de nada no sab a lo que suced a a mis espaldas no ve a las caras no sab a c mo se colocaban c mo se preparaban c mo respiraban
5171604 y adem s delante me tragu todos los cambios de ritmo todos los acelerones pues no permit que nadie me quitara el lugar de privilegio y me fui quedando sin fuerzas y aunque me daba cuenta de mi error no pod a cambiar de t ctica a mitad de la carrera una vez que has jugado tus bazas tienes que llegar hasta el final
5171605 cuando me pas y no pude seguirle supe que hab a muerto

5171610 it obviously came as quite a shock we had a pretty close school group were all pretty close
5171611 its going to rock us pretty hard he was just a good bloke
5171612 he was top notch he was a real genuine bloke
5171613 his funeral is going to be absolutely enormous because youd be hard pressed to finding someone who didnt get along well with tom
5171614 tom had been talking about me joining him on this trip for about the last two months
5171615 then he left a message on my facebook telling me he was going down saying sorry about the late notice but im heading down to the snow are you still keen
5171616 i dont check my facebook that regularly and i checked it on saturday and i was like damn i missed out and then this happened
5171617 never shy of a fun time old tommy he was a good social lad
5171618 he was an adventurous one he came up to newcastle not that long ago to do a scuba diving course with his bro and he was big on his skiing
5171619 he was always doing something adventurous he was into rock climbing and any sort of adventure sport
5171620 i know a lot of the boys at the schools were pretty fond of him because he was a young guy that was into rugby and whatnot i think he really got on well with the students that didnt get along with other teachers
5171621 this tragic loss comes at a time when mr carr boyd was just starting out on a promising teaching career
5171622 the school offers its sincere sympathy to mr family and friends
5171623 his place in sydney was a social hub for everyone his doors were always open for guests passing through or staying the night
5171624 oro o plata si lo peleas tanto como nosotros es la bomba
5171625 los jueces han dicho que esperan un informe de los medidores de 49er que deben dar validez a las piezas cambiadas por los daneses
5171626 fuese cual fuese el premio hubi ramos estado igual de contentos pero ahora
5171627 ya dijimos que no bamos a parar de pelear que nos bamos a dejar la piel en la regata por las medallas y alguien nos ha puesto a prueba en unas condiciones terribles tenemos el fruto de pelear como locos
5171628 se han equivocado cuando el viento es tan duro hay que conservar
5171629 nosotros hemos montado el spee para ver que estuviera todo bien y nos quedamos quietos 40 minutos
5171630 la experiencia te dice d nde est n los l mites
5171631 el viento ha ido subiendo durante la regata y todos bamos al l mite jug ndonos las medallas el problema no era el viento era la ola dif cil y complicada y que al lado ten amos a cinco barcos arriesgando much simo
5171632 son barcos complicados r pidos y dif ciles de manejar
5171633 oro o plata si lo peleas tanto como lo hemos peleado es igualmente la bomba
5171634 las cosas iban muy mal no est bamos contentos yo estaba hecho polvo porque muri mi madre y no ten a ganas de seguir navegando
5171635 era mi obligaci n no pod a dejar a xabi tirado ni a la gente que nos estaba ayudando en ese momento dif cil hoy me acuerdo de mi madre m s que nunca
5171636 the accused didnt agree to the alternative proposal and he threatened to shoot the woman
5171637 no recuerdo nada atraves el c sped intentando recordar por qu estaba all
5171638 eran mi familia mis amigos todos los que han venido de palencia a apoyarme
5171639 no recuerdo nada cuando atraves el c sped iba intentando recordar por qu estaba all qu hab a pasado si hasta pensaba que a n llevaba la cinta en el pelo
5171640 en la primera en atlanta era a n una ni a en la segunda en sidney pill un virus unos d as antes en adelaida y compet enferma me eliminaron en las semifinales de 5 000 metros
5171641 a atenas no llegu porque estuve lesionada aqu por fin hab a llegado a la final hab a dado un paso m s compet a sin ninguna enfermedad
5171642 ten a que seguir trabajando de eso se trata la vida
5171643 sab a que la medalla era muy dif cil pero la he peleado con mucha cabeza
5171644 e iba ya a lo m ximo con el coraz n en la boca
5171645 pero me negu a perder sab a que la medalla iba a estar muy dif cil que pod a quedar tercera o cuarta pero iba a ir hasta el final
5171646 pero esto es el mejor est mulo para seguir adelante este golpe me dice que tengo que seguir trabajando para mejorar
5171647 hay que seguir luchando soy una luchadora sta es una historia para contar pero a n no ha terminado creo en los finales felices a la cuarta en londres 2012 ser la vencida estoy gafada en los juegos pero creo en el destino
5171648 die polizisten stellten immer wieder fest dass die autofahrer zum schuljahresbeginn zu wenig r cksicht zeigen
5171649 die polizei geht konsequent gegen falsches verhalten im stra enverkehr vor dieses fehlverhalten ist unverantwortlich und r cksichtslos gerade f r die erstkl ssler die in den ersten wochen ihrer schulzeit viele neue eindr cke erleben m ssen erwachsene vorbilder sein
5171650 alle m ssen im stra enverkehr aufpassen um verkehrsunf lle mit kindern zu verhindern

5171661 vanessa trabalhou muito para isto e sempre disse que queria levar alguma medalha para portugal
5171662 um grande momento mas sobretudo o momento da vanessa ela trabalhou muito para isto e sempre disse que queria levar alguma medalha para portugal
5171663 ela sempre deixou claro quais eram os seus objectivos leva a medalha de prata uma proeza fant stica agora vamos deix la festejar com a equipa e com toda a fam lia todos foram fundamentais para o triunfo

5171665 die regierenden sollen endlich zu ihrer verantwortung stehen mit lippenbekenntnissen bek mpft man armut nicht mit unserer unterst tzung des stand up wollen wir im namen von millionen menschen weltweit deutlich machen dass endlich gehandelt werden muss um die un millenniumsziele zu erreichen
5171666 mit zuspitzung der weltweiten lage ist die umsetzung der millenniumsziele dringlicher denn je die bewegung w chst immer mehr menschen werden selber aktiv und fordern dies auch von ihren politischen vertretern

5171674 i will insist the hebrews have contributed more to civilize men than any other nation if i was an atheist and believed in blind eternal fate i should still believe that fate had ordained the jews to be the most essential instrument for civilizing the nations they are the most glorious nation that ever inhabited this earth the romans and their empire were but a bubble in comparison to the jews they have given religion to three quarters of the globe and have influenced the affairs of mankind more and more happily than any other nation ancient or modern
5171675 if statistics are right the jews constitute but one percent of the human race it suggests a nebulous dim puff of stardust lost in the blaze of the milky way properly the jew ought hardly to be heard of but he is heard of has always been heard of he is as prominent on the planet as any other people and his commercial importance is extravagantly out of proportion to the smallness of his bulk his contributions to the worlds list of great names in literature science art music finance medicine and abstruse learning are also away out of proportion to the weakness of his numbers he has made a marvelous fight in this world in all the ages and had done it with his hands tied behind him he could be vain of himself and be excused for it the egyptian the babylonian and the persian rose filled the planet with sound and splendor then faded to dream stuff and passed away the greek and the roman followed and made a vast noise and they are gone other people have sprung up and held their torch high for a time but it burned out and they sit in twilight now or have vanished the jew saw them all beat them all and is now what he always was exhibiting no decadence no infirmities of age no weakening of his parts no slowing of his energies no dulling of his alert and aggressive mind all things are mortal but the jew all other forces pass but he remains what is the secret of his immortality
5171676 the jews started it all and by it i mean so many of the things we care about the underlying values that make all of us jew and gentile believer and aethiest tick without the jews we would see the world through different eyes hear with different ears even feel with different feelings we would think with a different mind interpret all our experience differently draw different conclusions from the things that befall us and we would set a different course for our lives
5171677 energy is the basis of everything every jew no matter how insignificant is engaged in some decisive and immediate pursuit of a goal it is the most perpetual people of the earth
5171678 some people like the jews and some do not but no thoughtful man can deny the fact that they are beyond any question the most formidable and the most remarkable race which has appeared in the world
5171679 ich arbeite seit 24 jahren im handel und habe schon eine menge fundsachen entdeckt aber bargeld in dieser dimension ist mir noch nicht untergekommen
5171680 dieser punkt ist in meinen augen nicht verhandelbar er muss alle russischen streitkr fte betreffen die seit dem 7 august nach georgien gekommen sind
5171681 ich bekomme mehr und mehr das gef hl dass der alt bundeskanzler ein gest rtes verh ltnis zu seiner fr heren bet tigung hat sobald russland ins spiel kommt ist sein urteil in h chstem ma e unverh ltnism ig und unangemessen
5171682 ein schr der muss sich dann auch den vorwurf eines lupenreinen diplomatischen hasardeurs gefallen lassen jede seiner aussagen ist eine beispiellose br skierung von au enminister frank walter steinmeier
5171683 schr der ist mittlerweile die prominenteste stimme moskaus in deutschland
5171684 eine einseitige schuldzuweisung frei nach dem motto wes brot ich ess des lied ich sing dem altkanzler ist offenbar die au enpolitische weitsicht abhandengekommen
5171685 er schw cht die position des westens und erweist der sache der menschenrechte und des v lkerrechts einen b rendienst wer f r gazprom arbeitet sollte k nftig bei themen die russland betreffen besser schweigen
5171686 auch der palmkern lspeicher auf der stralauer halbinsel direkt am rummelsburger see wurde an einen irischen investor ver u ert
5171687 statt gittern vor den fenstern gibt es dann gro z gige terrassen und balkone statt kaltem steinfu boden eichenparkett
5171688 der schiedsrichter wollte hier unbedingt im mittelpunkt stehen er hat unserem team zwei punkte geklaut
5171689 mit den beiden punkten h tten wir den zweiten satz gewonnen und im entscheidenden dritten satz h tten wir sehr gute chancen auf den sieg gehabt
5171690 es ist einfach schade dass ein schiedsrichter bei so einem wichtigen spiel nicht in der lage ist ein wenig fingerspitzengef hl zu zeigen wir waren unserer meinung nach im recht und dann gleich einen punktabzug hinnehmen zu m ssen das ist nat rlich bitter
5171691 es wird zeit dass auch in unserer sportart endlich ein videobeweis eingef hrt wird so wie zum beispiel beim tennis
5171692 wir haben hier teilweise sehr gute spiele abgeliefert und im viertelfinale auszuscheiden ist keine schande
5171693 jetzt bleiben wir noch bis zum wochenende hier und dann geht es bei den deutschen meisterschaften in timmendorf weiter
5171694 die hitze der druck falsches essen bei olympia sind die bedingungen einfach anders
5171695 i will insist the hebrews have contributed more to civilize men than any other nation if i was an atheist and believed in blind eternal fate i should still believe that fate had ordained the jews to be the most essential instrument for civilizing the nations they are the most glorious nation that ever inhabited this earth the romans and their empire were but a bubble in comparison to the jews they have given religion to three quarters of the globe and have influenced the affairs of mankind more and more happily than any other nation ancient or modern

5171700 when it comes to testicular cancer our health is quite literally in our hands
5171701 there is a very high success rate of treatment for testicular cancer if its caught early enough
5171702 self examination is crucial and i hope that these shower cards and posters will help remind men to have a quick check after a game work out or shower
5171703 testicular cancer does not have to kill it can be treated if caught in time
5171704 with 100 men being diagnosed every year with this form of cancer its clear that there is a great deal more that we can do to remind young men to regularly examine themselves
5171705 by circulating posters and shower cards throughout leisure centres and sporting organisations in wales we hope to raise awareness of this important issue
5171706 our passing game has not been as consistent with him out
5171707 he definitely adds a spark and is a player we need back
5171708 each and every player knows whats going on and didnt take too much of it to heart
5171709 but as long as he shuts up and produces thats all that matters
5171710 chad being chad hes been loony and kooky since hes been here were much better if hes on our team
5171711 wenn dieser punkt des abkommens nicht umgehend und komplett umgesetzt wird werde ich einen eu gipfel einberufen um zu entscheiden welche konsequenzen daraus zu ziehen sind
5171712 den direkten zugang zu mehreren millionen digitaler objekte aus europas bibliotheken museen archiven und audiovisuellen sammlungen ber ein einziges portal bieten
5171713 die europ ische digitale bibliothek wird den menschen einen schnellen und einfachen zugang zu europ ischen b chern und kunstwerken bieten
5171714 so wird beispielsweise ein tschechischer student in werken der british library bl ttern k nnen ohne dazu nach london reisen zu m ssen oder ein irischer kunstliebhaber die mona lisa bewundern k nnen ohne vor dem louvre schlange zu stehen
5171715 in den bibliotheken europas lagern mehr als 2 5 milliarden b cher
5171716 die werke die auf europeana verf gbar sein werden werden in aller regel entweder nicht mehr urheberrechtlich gesch tzt sein oder mit genehmigung des rechteinhabers zur verf gung gestellt
5171717 when i found out i had an opportunity to play with these guys it took my game to another level
5171718 you dont want to be that guy thats holding them back ive been able to do some good things since ive been in this camp and show those guys i can definitely contribute
5171719 it was more of a blitzing defense where the linebackers made a lot of the plays for us
5171720 we rushed inside and didnt get a chance to go after the quarterback every play here the d line is really good and to have the kind of coaches we have and the technique they teach its no wonder they do what they do its not a coincidence
5171721 i havent seen anybody his age work as hard as he does he gets some work in
5171722 if theres anything i learned from him its to keep working on your craft
5171723 he can be great hes picked up the game quick
5171724 as young as he is i just see a lot of stuff he does on the field and a lot of guys dont learn that type of stuff until theyre down the road in their careers
5171725 being as young as he is its been a benefit for him to have the type of players hes been around to pick up from stray to pick up from osi and all that type of stuff
5171726 im starting to see the bigger picture a little more once i got to the point where i can stop thinking about everything and do it naturally i expect to be a lot better
5171727 tried to stick my nose in the b gap instead of staying outside guys in this league are good and when they see that they take advantage of you
5171728 he didnt get by me in the passing game but every time i blocked him i felt his power hes definitely going to have a good season
5171729 no question if we dont were not going to win and thats what it comes down to
5171730 yeah i think 3 4 5 in the lineup has to come up big we havent lately but today we did
5171731 it was nice they got off to a three run lead and it was important for us to answer the call
5171732 i would say the moon landing was right up there with the mets in the world series
5171733 but the deal is that i have to bring it back
5171734 so the bottom line is if we keep winning well be okay
5171735 i had numerous people on the redskins team tell me man it almost dont look right
5171736 like starting all over again i had some feelings i hadnt felt in 17 years
5171737 he was able to move the team down the field and put us in a position to score
5171738 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
5171739 i am a true apple fan so this is nothing to make apple look bad i think apple should come out and tell people whats going on with these phones
5171740 my calls get dropped a lot and im not even moving one inch anywhere
5171741 i move my chair a little bit and my call gets dropped its just weird
5171742 a second window slant which to the average person means nothing
5171743 a lot of guys wont throw that ball in the second window or the receiver will give up when he runs into a defender
5171744 little things like that are easily overlooked by the average fan i told jerricho dont give up the second window there could be a third window because thats the way ive always played
5171745 thats what im trying to get across to those guys
5171746 the only things that ive tried to get across to them are things that have worked for me in the past you dont have to be the fastest biggest or strongest just be on the same page as me and vice versa i think that was a start saturday
5171747 something just said just run to the next window and hell hit you
5171748 obviously laveranues has been injured and its hard to get timing and stuff down
5171749 but ive been watching a lot of film on these guys from last year seeing how they run routes
5171750 i told you 19 wins first ive got to get to 19
5171751 i still have work to do still got six weeks to play its been quite a few years since ive been at 16 and its still august so hopefully i could get a few more before the season is over to be at 16 already means ive been doing some things right
5171752 itll come if he continues to pitch the way hes pitching
5171753 hes had a great season its something thats a possibility
5171754 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5171755 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5171756 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5171757 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5171758 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5171759 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5171760 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5171761 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5171762 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5171763 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5171764 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again

5171776 johan santana cut through pittsburghs lineup like a knife through butter
5171777 dari 1 018 calon yang mendaftar yang berhasil menjadi caleg adalah 620 dari 77 dapil dari jumlah tersebut 424 laki laki dan 196 perempuan
5171778 dari hasil seleksi tersebut kita sudah melebihi batas batas minimum caleg perempuan yaitu minimum 30 persen sedang kita mencapai 32 persen
5171779 usia caleg yang kurang dari 50 tahun sebanyak 68 persen sedang di atas 50 tahun 32 persen tapi kalau kita lihat rata rata yang menjadi caleg berada di usia 31 51 tahun
5171780 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5171781 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5171782 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5171783 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5171784 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5171785 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5171786 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5171787 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5171788 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5171789 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5171790 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5171791 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5171792 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5171793 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5171794 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5171795 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5171796 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5171797 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5171798 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5171799 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5171800 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5171801 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5171802 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5171803 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5171804 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5171805 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5171806 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5171807 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5171808 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5171809 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5171810 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5171811 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5171812 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5171813 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5171814 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5171815 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5171816 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5171817 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5171818 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5171819 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5171820 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5171821 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5171822 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5171823 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5171824 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5171825 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5171826 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5171827 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5171828 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5171829 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5171830 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5171831 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5171832 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5171833 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5171834 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5171835 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5171836 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5171837 this is a planning took where all things are going
5171838 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5171839 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5171840 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5171841 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5171842 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5171843 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5171844 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5171845 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5171846 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5171847 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5171848 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5171849 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5171850 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5171851 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5171852 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5171853 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5171854 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5171855 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5171856 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5171857 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5171858 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5171859 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5171860 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5171861 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5171862 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5171863 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5171864 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5171865 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5171866 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5171867 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5171868 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5171869 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5171870 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5171871 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5171872 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5171873 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5171874 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5171875 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5171876 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5171877 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5171878 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5171879 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5171880 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5171881 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5171882 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5171883 most of what you see is his input along with mine he has gone into the detail he has been part of it and comes here to look at things
5171884 mankind have a great aversion to intellectual labor but even supposing knowledge to be easily attainable more people would be content to be ignorant than would take even a little trouble to acquire it
5171885 inspiration is wonderful when it happens but the writer must develop an approach for the rest of the time the wait is simply too long
5171886 now i know what a statesman is hes a dead politician we need more statesmen
5171887 my wife and i were happy for twenty years then we met
5171888 procrastination isnt the problem its the solution so procrastinate now dont put it off
5171889 if theres anything unsettling to the stomach its watching actors on television talk about their personal lives

5171895 the maxis studio has had an absolute blast creating spore but the fun is just beginning the most engaging stories are truly the ones people create themselves and we cant wait to see how players not only craft and explore the spore universe but hear what stories they have to tell as a result

5171898 bo knew how to change lives for the better he did it very well
5171899 he gave us inroads he showed that only people with the community in their soul were the ones who could be effective
5171900 i dont even like to stereotype and say gang members i say theyre disenfranchised youth
5171901 they dont really have all the tools to make the right decisions thats necessary in todays society and they dont fully understand the system
5171902 bo would tell his personal story of being a former gang member who would not let gang life trap him into a sense of hopelessness and despair
5171903 and he talked about working hard and not making excuses
5171904 you dont find many in the gang intervention world who can be effective in the street effective in the courtroom effective at city hall and effective in the prisons he could calm everyone down and make us work together
5171905 he helped bridge that divide by setting the example of partnership

5171909 it looked easy but when youre tired you get a little dizzy
5171910 this is the best thing thats ever happened to me in my life and in my career
5171911 ive been dreaming about this moment since i was eight years old
5171912 i would hope that this initiative can bring an end to the conflict that we have had for several years the discussions indicate that that is going to happen
5171913 within the discussions we have made it quite clear to the amaury group that we respect their organizational rights in their events and we ask that they respect the uci in its authority according to its statutes
5171914 mcquaid said he hoped the deal could be made formal before the ucis congress in september in varese italy and that this would lead to an end to legal action being taken by both sides and allow the uci to rescind its suspension of the french cycling federation
5171915 there are fundamental differences in opinion as to how the sport should develop between the uci and the organizers
5171916 land as far as the eye can see portuguese in the old
5171917 we dont want people putting themselves at risk and that would be my concern in this situation ms nixon said today
5171918 what bothers me when we sort of see sometimes ideas like this i know the community might think that would be a good thing to do but i get concerned about people driving in motor vehicles when theyre using their mobile phones
5171919 second is you may well have that vigilante kind of thing we dont want our community to put themselves at risk
5171920 i think that people thought it would be a good idea i also understand some of the people in the community think crushing peoples cars might be a good idea as well for hoons but we dont seem to think thats appropriate
5171921 we see the potential for that footage being able to further extend what already takes place mr cameron said
5171922 jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think ive ever met

5171928 a fortnight ago in finland we were the outsiders but we managed to come out on top
5171929 here on the contrary everybody saw us as favourites and that put us under a certain amount of pressure
5171930 it has been a problem for six or seven years
5171931 they will be disappointed but they will understand when somebody has an accident you cant help it
5171932 that is the thing when you see the crowd you realize why he had to come out
5171933 we worked hard every day but the result was as you see and its really hard to take
5171934 it takes a special individual who really wants to meet a special need in the community
5171935 mr paavo lipponen will become advisor for addressing environmental issues and receiving permits to build the pipeline in finland with his help well try to clear up legal matters concerning the peculiarities of the finnish law
5171936 ill work with two parties i can point to the opinion of the finnish government regarding the nord stream management and convey information from corresponding finnish bodies
5171937 the company has issued a white book of environmental norms kommersant its working its way through the legal labyrinth all it has to do now is comply with the planned deadline of launching the pipeline

5171944 appear to contain all of the required elements more detailed minutes of closed meetings may aid in the type of governmental transparency the act was intended to promote

5171946 if possible they should also walk or ride to school with a friend it is also a great idea to walk the route with them before school starts so they can become familiar with the area

5171957 this is a continuum that started back on 9 11 to reform law enforcement and the intelligence community to focus on the terrorism threat
5171958 it moves what the rules were from 1993 to the new world we live in but it maintains civil liberties
5171959 provide specialized equipment technical knowledge or assistance of expert personnel
5171960 if properly implemented this should assure the public that people are not being investigated by agencies who are not trained in how to protect constitutional rights
5171961 the fbi will need to be vigilant both in its policies and its practices to live up to that promise
5171962 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
5171963 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
5171964 in the right direction however the vagueness of the provisions giving broad access to criminal intelligence to undefined agencies is very troubling

5171972 the apatosaurus is a member of the giant plant eating dinosaurs it may still be better known by the misguided name brontosaurus apatosaurus and other giants such as diploducus and brachiosaurus roamed the swamps of the western united states in a bygone era
5171973 described by job the oldest book in the bible to be the largest animal of all behemoth
5171974 sic good historical evidence that these dinosaurs have co existed with man
5171975 elephant sized creature with smooth brownish gray skin a long flexible neck a very long tail as powerful as a crocodiles and three clawed feet the size of frying pans
5171976 feed on the nutlike fruit of a riverbank plant and keep to the deep pools and subsurface caves of waters in this largely unexplored region
5171977 in the fall of 1981 herman regusters led a team into lake tele and returned with droppings footprint casts and sound recording unlike any animal known to the congo basin area
5171978 a follow up expedition was initiated by the bbc in 2001 the most recent trip led by canadian brian sass discovered an island in the dja river which contained nesting caves like those identified by mackal they took casts of footprints and photographs of the caves bottom right and actually had a brief encounter with the elusive monster of cameroon as it swam past their dugout canoe toward its lair
5171979 huge creature with a long neck massive body and a rather indignant temperament which manifested itself when the beast was disturbed
5171980 spines along the back of the head down the neck and along the back
5171981 they were herbivores by nature and were only dangerous if humans disturbed them while they were eating
5171982 the brazilian minister at la paz bolivia had remitted to the minister of foreign affairs in rio photographs of drawings of an extraordinary saurian killed on the beni after receiving thirty six balls by order of the president of bolivia the dried body which had been preserved in asuncion was sent to la paz
5171983 in 1907 lieutenant colonel percy fawcett of the british army was sent to mark the boundaries between brazil and peru he was an officer in the royal engineers and was well known as a sic meticulous recorder of facts in the beni swamps of madre de dios colonel p h fawcett saw an animal he believed to be diplodocus the diplodocus story is confirmed by many of the tribes east of the ucayali a region covered by clark
5171984 speaking of reptiles old boy colonel fawcett reached the eastern edge of madre de dios out where you are going
5171985 in 2005 genesis park staff mounted an exploratory trip up amazon tributaries along the border of brazil amp bolivia villagers and indigenous communities were contacted from the rio madre de dios up the rio beni and towards the rio madidi very little knowledge of any long necked reptilian creature was uncovered but what reports were received matched the information obtained about the mokele mbembe from the expeditions into africa a strange dinosaur like image has been found adorning a peruvian water bottle that dates from 200ad
5171986 it is quite likely that some of the large sauropod dinosaur species like diplodocus and apatosaurus were merely variations of the same created kind similarly despite the different names from africa to south america the general description of supposed living dinosaurs remains the same about 30 ft in length with a long neck snake like head and long flexible tail
5171987 apparently these dinosaurs are similar in form to their counterparts in the fossil record
5171988 credible reports from africa that these creatures persist even to the present

5171998 savages funny and often poignant film looks at how a bunch of semi stones hippies in northern california developed a unique style of off road bike riding through collaboration and competition the free floating and sometimes selfless sharing of technology quickly led to a full blown industry and olympic status as a sport in 1996

5172049 with these appointments the board is recognizing the great depth of talent at the company and further advancing our strategic development process currently underway to capitalize on future growth opportunities and enhance shareholder value
5172050 so its set in stone a c slater will be the host of americas best dance crew its probably better that way hes the only one that will work for hair grease
5172051 este improbabil ca sua sa impuna rusiei una din sanctiunile dictate in mod obisnuit impotriva regimurilor care nu respecta normele de drept international si ignora principiile democratiei
5172052 in structurile diplomatice politice economice si de securitate ale secolului xxi este amenintat
5172053 intr o economie mondializata pentru ca sanctiunile sa si atinga scopul se impune un acord la nivel global obiectiv aproape imposibil
5172054 experienta a demonstrat ca sanctiunile unilaterale nu numai ca nu functioneaza dar de cele mai multe ori se intorc impotriva companiilor americane
5172055 ce ne intereseaza este petrolul sua au incercat sa si reduca dependenta de titei dar fara succes si nu pot renunta la aceste importuri
5172056 nu putem vorbi decat de cel mult o stagnare a pietei avand in vedere ca numarul instrainarilor de imobile a crescut chiar daca nu intr un ritm foarte alert avem o crestere de aproximativ 300 de tranzactii fata de aceeasi perioada a anului trecut
5172057 in mai 2007 sunt inregistrate 2 260 de tranzactii iar in mai 2008 sunt raportate 1 879 in iunie anul trecut notarii au declarat in total 2 096 de instrainari de imobile iar anul acesta in aceeasi perioada 1 944
5172058 in urma declaratiilor notarilor am stabilit ca s a calculat si s a virat la bugetul de stat un impozit de 23 milioane de lei fata de 10 5 milioane de lei in perioada similara a anului trecut
5172059 avand in vedere ca numarul tranzactiilor este relativ constant fata de anul trecut cresterea valorii impozitelor nu poate fi determinata decat de o crestere a preturilor pe piata imobiliara
5172060 pretul nu este cu mult mai mic decat cel de anul trecut dar cu siguranta va sta pe loc cererea pentru locuinte este in continuare mare dar problema este ca creditele se dau tot mai greu
5172061 multi clienti nu cumpara pentru ca asteapta preturile la noile complexuri rezidentiale ca sa poata sa faca o comparatie cu pretul la apartamentele vechi scaderile de pret vor reflecta numai aceste diferente dintre noi si vechi aici se va aseza piata cine va dori sa locuiasca intr un bloc vechi va plati mai putin in timp ce persoanele care doresc sa locuiasca intr un imobil nou vor trebui sa plateasca mai mult pentru acest spor de confort
5172062 in blocurile cu bulina pretul apartamentelor a scazut cu 15 la suta o astfel de locuinta poate fi cumparata cu minimum 35 000 si cu maximum 65 000 de euro in functie de zona in care este amplasata
5172063 aceste masuri nu vor face decat sa micsoreze cererea solvabila in conditiile in care se aplica scenariul cel mai prost pentru a vedea daca solicitantul poate suporta creditul acesta fie va lua un credit mai mic fie nu l va mai lua deloc si asa piata este asa cum este cu un numar mic de tranzactii iar aceasta masura va face ca numarul de tranzactii sa scada
5172064 au existat mai multe motive pentru eliminarea acestei prevederi printre care posibilitatea ca scenariul prezentat clientului sa fie mai optimist decat conditiile efective viitoare ceea ce ar fi dat posibilitatea unei contestari din partea clientului in compensatie s ar putea introduce ajustarea gradului de indatorare in functie de riscuri inclusiv de riscul valutar
5172065 nu am investit bani de la inceput in business pentru ca apoi sa l facem sa mearga l am facut sa mearga si pe masura ce castigam faceam investitii
5172066 in fiecare an incearca cineva sa ne copieze apare unul dispare altul
5172067 avem clienti din prima editie 80 dintre clientii nostri sunt constanti
5172068 sunt firme care ne au spus ca 40 din cifra lor de afaceri provine din reclama in oferte speciale
5172069 ne am dezvoltat si trebuie sa coordonez mult mai multe activitati trebuie sa ma formez eu sa fiu altfel prin pregatirea prin cursurile pe care le am facut si cartile pe care le am citit m am schimbat acum imi este intr adevar usor dar anul trecut mi a fost mai greu nu am stiut cum se rezolva anumite situatii pe care cineva cu experienta le ar fi rezolvat mult mai repede si mai usor
5172070 cel mai indicat ar fi un partener local cu experienta in vanzare de publicitate
5172071 anul acesta am hotarat sa nu mai mergem la targuri de franciza intrucat mi am dat seama ca m am dezvoltat un pic mai repede decat puteam sa fac fata ca master francizat
5172072 vor ca reclama lor sa apara in hipermarket chiar daca persoanele interesate de reduceri se duc in magazine de tip discounter
5172073 ne asteptam ca pana la finalul acestui an sa realizam cu 40 mai multe campanii de cuponing fata de anul trecut acest fapt indica o crestere evidenta a interesului producatorilor pentru metodele de promovare la punctele de vanzare
5172074 nimic nu e mai important ca odata cu alegerile parlamentare sa se organizeze si un referendum pentru modificarea constitutiei in ceea ce priveste imunitatea pentru demnitari
5172075 va creste traficul postal de colete si implicit veniturile companiei urmand ca in viitor sa fie vandute spatii publicitare pe site nu in ultimul rand posta va obtine si capital de imagine
5172076 aparent nimic nu a functionat in acest model de afacere ca un minim exemplu al faptului ca magazinul nu a functionat eu personal nici macar nu stiam ca un asemenea site exista in peisajul on line din romania iar in calitate de investitor in domeniul on line eu chiar incerc sa urmaresc competitorii din acest peisaj ca si alte initiative on line relevante in care m as putea implica in viitor ca si investitor si nu stiam despre postmarket pe buna dreptate deoarece respectivul site chiar nu a existat in peisajul e commerce romanesc
5172077 in martie aprilie anul viitor vom incepe sa construim pe terenul societatii trei brazi din predeal un hotel cu 140 146 de camere care va fi clasificat la cinci stele alaturi de el vom ridica si un bloc cu 80 de apartamente
5172078 negociem deja cu doua lanturi hoteliere internationale afilierea hotelului pe care il construim
5172079 am scos sif transilvania din actionariatul trei brazi si din acest motiv nu mai are rost sa lasam societatea la bursa acum controlez peste 95 din trei brazi

5172083 foarte probabil tot mai multi investitori vor fi tentati sa isi inchida pozitiile dezamagiti de lipsa de reactie a pietei la raportarile financiare
5172084 lipsa unei componente semnificative reprezentate de investitorii de portofoliu care sa beneficieze de timp si rationalitate s a resimtit in ultimele luni pe piata de capital
5172085 in prezent asistam la o piata condusa de nevoia de lichiditate finantarea capitalurilor speculative este tot mai grea si mai scumpa astfel incat lichidizarea cu orice pret a detinerilor de actiuni devine din pacate de multe ori obligatorie
5172086 este posibil ca preturile la imobiliare sa inceapa sa se stabilizeze sau sa atinga pragul cel mai de jos in prima jumatate a anului viitor
5172087 pe aceeasi panta descendenta pe toata durata lui 2009 si mai departe
5172088 procesul de corectie a pietei nu s a terminat e undeva la jumatatea drumului ceea ce inseamna pierderi masive in orase precum los angeles sau miami unde sectorul imobiliar a traversat cea mai fulminanta dezvoltare
5172089 desi cresterea secventiala a pietei este un lucru neobisnuit pentru al doilea trimestru calendaristic este evident ca in trimestrul 2 2008 livrarile de procesoare realizate de intel au determinat o crestere
5172090 noi va trebui sa ne gandim pe langa toate masurile interne pe care le am luat si la o deschidere a pietei fortei de munca in domeniul medical si pentru medici din alte tari din afara spatiului uniunii europene dar care vor putea sa vina cu certificate de conformitate din care sa reiasa ca pregatirea din acele tari este pe masura curriculei din uniunea europeana si daca aceste lucruri vor fi realizate in romania vom putea atrage multi medici
5172091 am vazut medici din tari arabe care astazi sunt sefi de sectie sunt sefi de spitale in romania deci se pot atrage si asemenea specialisti si vom incerca sa i atragem pe cei mai buni
5172092 nu exista niciun judet din tara care sa aiba acoperite cu specialisti toate ramurile medicale dar sunt orase in care exista excedent de medici sunt centrele universitare unde toti medicii trag sa se duca si acolo de exemplu schemele de personal sunt depasite de aceea unele spitale chiar mari clinice au probleme de buget
5172093 majorarea capitalului s a facut prin reevaluarea hipermarketurilor pic de la braila si oradea
5172094 i didnt feel my finger shaking but i guess it was
5172095 i said that the last time this happened the last time the reason was katy this time i dont know what the reason is yet but im sure something goods going to come from it
5172096 with this olympics right now right here is where we can prove who is the best in the world
5172097 were looking to make our stamp on the game ourselves
5172098 i dont know if this team has such strong dominating personalities
5172099 we have 18 players who make decisions together were in this together
5172100 we had this brand we know this audience very well and the brand still resonates with young adults
5172101 instead of going out and creating a new brand we can bring back something still love and enjoy
5172102 angel and buffy were part of the lineup of the wb
5172103 if we didnt bring those two to what were doing we would have had people outside burning torches its about creating a robust lineup this isnt just roll out the library this is about creating a complete schedule that has a lot of great content for the viewer to view
5172104 its a very different model from television however we have very successful hollywood producers mcg
5172105 this is not youtube quality this is content thats coming from a studio and as warner bros we have to maintain a level of quality that viewers expect from us this isnt about skimping and making cheap content
5172106 you look at it say i learned something and then you send it to your friends and say you wont believe this
5172107 the main catalyst for this project is the expansion thats taking place at refineries along the texas gulf coast
5172108 this would provide an alternative to lightering help reduce congestion in the houston ship channel and other ports and help companies avoid extra port fees
5172109 yeah im thrilled im over the moon but im pretty laid back takes a lot to get me going i mean this is fantastic i will relish this moment driving home and even before i go to sleep it will be an unbelievable feeling
5172110 im not one to jump around and high five everyone in this room it will be a great satisfaction just to think i pulled it off and did it its a wonderful feeling doesnt happen that often in golf unless youre tiger woods to win three its been special and hopefully i can win more
5172111 i know im swedish but i really do feel american to be honest with you
5172112 but my heritage is european and i would love to play on nicks team i know all the european guys on the team i used to play on the european tour and i know all the guys on the american team i might be a little different but im going to be playing hard for europe if i make the team
5172113 obviously when you run across players you start following them around real fast

5172123 he is a wise man he is a very experienced man and he has seen the writing on the wall
5172124 he has seen the sentiments of not just the elected representatives but various institutions who all asked him to move in a particular way and do not destabilise things here

5172141 tom had been talking about me joining him on this trip for about the last two months
5172142 then he left a message on my facebook telling me he was going down saying sorry about the late notice but im heading down to the snow are you still keen

5172146 he was always doing something adventurous he was into rock climbing and any sort of adventure sport
5172147 i know a lot of the boys at the schools were pretty fond of him because he was a young guy that was into rugby and whatnot i think he really got on well with the students that didnt get along with other teachers
5172148 this tragic loss comes at a time when mr carr boyd was just starting out on a promising teaching career

5172313 bennigans franchising company and steak amp ale franchising company have the franchising agreement assets
5172314 those are not part of the filing of chapter 7 they are still subsidiaries of s amp a restaurant corp but they were not part of the filing they werent part of the filing on july 29
5172315 the franchisor bennigans franchising has the exclusive rights to use the trademarks for restaurant operations and in franchising
5172316 those trademarks are also collateral for the atalaya lending facility
5172317 once the bankruptcy case is on the horizon congress has made a determination that companies cannot take activity to opt out of the collective process that is looming on the horizon for a company that is getting ready to file bankruptcy the bankruptcy code generally doesnt allow them to cherry pick assets and leave behind a carcass
5172318 an entity filing in bankruptcy cannot pick and choose which of its assets are affected by the bankruptcy
5172319 s amp a restaurant corp made an assignment to fortress credit opportunities l p of a security interest in the marks
5172320 what that generally should mean if properly drawn is that s amp a retained ownership and fortress secured the loan based on the asset value of the trademarks in 2003 then on july 10 2008 s amp a assigned its trademark rights to metromedia there appears to have been no recorded reassignment of the security interest back to fortress so fortress may still be a creditor
5172321 there may be an issue of fraud on creditors given the short space of time between the assignment and the bankruptcy filing
5172322 the bennigans situation looks like a very clever attempt to bankruptcy proof the franchise agreements and ownership of the trademarks
5172323 the question is going to be whether this clever attempt will hold water at the end of the day if and when parties start challenging and closely scrutinizing those relationships
5172324 there is no risk that debtors and non debtors would be substantively consolidated for the reasons given
5172325 my tentative theory rests on fraudulent transfer law and not substantive consolidation
5172326 the trademarks are owned by s amp a which presumably has an intercompany license agreement allowing bennigans franchising to use the trademarks a company called fortress credit opportunities appears to have held a security interest in the trademarks just before the chapter 7 filing this security interest appears to have been transferred to metromedia company which i understand was the indirect owner of s amp a restaurant corp presumably metromedia has or will exercise its right as a secured creditor to become the transferee of both the trademarks and the intercompany license agreement to satisfy any debt from bennigans franchising to metromedia
5172327 because the trademarks and the franchise agreements themselves are not the subject of the bankruptcy it is doubtful that any group of franchisees will have the opportunity to acquire the trademarks in the way that ground round franchisees did some years ago
5172328 the fraudulent transfer analysis is completely different than a substantive consolidation analysis
5172329 i would suggest that a trustee investigate who originally owned the royalty rights and trademarks have they been transferred or assigned to other entities when and how did those rights get housed in the present entities
5172330 i would then apply bankruptcy code section 548 and the texas uniform fraudulent transfer act to see if any transfer existed the value of what was transferred what was received in exchange for the rights transferred whether the transferor was insolvent etc
5172331 the creation of a security interest and its perfections are both transfers under the bankruptcy code
5172332 managements decisions about what entities to put into bankruptcy and what entities not to is presumed to be a valid exercise of business judgment
5172333 if an entity files in bankruptcy and its subsidiary does not generally only the filing entity and its assets could be governed by the bankruptcy not the assets of the subsidiary
5172334 the stock of the subsidiary is an asset of the filing entity and could not be cherry picked away this is assuming the subsidiary is a valid subsidiary and there is no basis for attacking or otherwise dealing with the corporate entity or avoiding any of the agreements or actions they have taken there are provisions in the bankruptcy code that might be available to do such things if the right circumstances exist
5172335 not withstanding the acknowledgement that management can make decisions of what entity files for bankruptcy and what entity does not
5172336 the question is whether the creditors can somehow trace or challenge or otherwise recover assets that are in those entities that are outside the bankruptcy sub family
5172337 this appears like it could be from a page out of a 1990s or early 2000s playbook in the area of the securitization of accounts receivable
5172338 of course at the end of the day there may not be any avoidable transfer but who knows until at least a preliminary investigation is undertaken
5172339 but what if something does go wrong and i get pregnant i dont want to ruin my life and become a mother at 16

5172375 the guidelines are designed to minimise the use of animals in scientific research through focusing on the three rs the replacement of animal research with other types of research when possible reduction of the number of animals used in research and refinement of research techniques to minimise pain and distress
5172376 when it is necessary to study animals in medical research all involved have an obligation to care for the animals in the best ways possible
5172377 but the issue remains though that while we have these great documents there is still no compulsory training for new and existing researchers on the laws and the best ways to reduce pain and distress
5172378 and they are not trained in the many excellent alternatives like computer modelling for example that can do just as good a job in testing without involving animals
5172379 at the moment there is a feeling there is far too much animal testing going on because of a lack of knowledge in many quarters and unfortunately a document while encouraging is not going to change that

5172386 the construction work is underway and is expected to be completed by the first week of october we are planning to open the memorial to public on the birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi
5172387 many indian sailors have lost their lives during world war i and world war ii their sacrifice should get proper recognition and respect from the people so we have planned to build this memorial pmc has given the space to our organisation for this purpose
5172388 when baner road was dug up for road widening some bsnl cables snapped affecting our phone lines since then the pmc has laid a concrete road here but our phone lines are yet to be repaired when we made enquiries we were told that the lines would not be repaired till the games are over as the road cannot be dug again
5172389 the road widening at baner has resulted in cable faults but it is being repaired regularly in this case if a connection has been down for more than a month it is an aberration
5172390 if one cable is cut at least 200 300 connections are disrupted if it is a major cable then over 600 800 connections can be affected
5172391 there is some delay is getting the repair work done but it is being done the customer will not have to wait till the youth games to get a working phone connections
5172392 the bsnl cables are laid out in a haphazard manner which is why they keep getting cut however i do not remember bsnl ever placing a proposal to dig up a road in baner for conducting repair work at baner we have laid out the ducts along the road where the company can lay new lines

5172405 that is not an indication that i am going to grant bail dont tell your client to be optimistic
5172406 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5172407 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

5172409 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5172410 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5172411 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5172412 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5172413 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5172414 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5172415 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5172416 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5172417 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5172418 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5172419 who are open to doing something on the production side
5172420 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5172421 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5172422 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5172423 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5172424 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5172425 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5172426 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5172427 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5172428 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5172429 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5172430 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5172431 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5172432 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5172433 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5172434 it was very surprising that these subjects would still have cells floating in their blood so long afterward
5172435 the antibodies that we isolated are remarkable antibodies they grab onto the virus very tightly and they virtually never fall off
5172436 that allows them to kill the 1918 virus with extreme potency meaning it takes a very small amount of antibody
5172437 the thought is the first influenza that you see during life is the one that you have the best immunity to
5172438 if we can learn the rules about how these antibodies work we may be able to design antibodies to lots of other viruses
5172439 this study tells us that human beings can make long lasting immune responses to bird influenza
5172440 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5172441 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5172442 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5172443 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5172444 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5172445 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5172446 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5172447 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5172448 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5172449 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5172450 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5172451 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

5172453 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5172454 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5172455 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5172456 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5172457 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5172458 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5172459 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5172460 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5172461 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5172462 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5172463 who would dare follow that possibly the best show theres been on cab
5172464 yes neil can hold his own against such a challenge
5172465 he will have no equity stake thats fairly certain he stands to take a pretty sizable hit for sure

5172468 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5172469 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5172470 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5172471 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5172472 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5172473 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5172474 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5172475 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5172476 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5172477 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5172478 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5172479 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5172480 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5172481 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5172482 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5172483 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5172484 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5172485 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5172486 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5172487 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5172488 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5172489 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5172490 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5172491 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5172492 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5172493 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5172494 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5172495 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5172496 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5172497 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5172498 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5172499 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5172500 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5172501 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5172502 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5172503 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5172504 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5172505 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5172506 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations

5172521 saya tolak aja tadinya mau naik kereta gaya baru tapi habis ditawarin calo nggak ah mending pindah kereta akhirnya naik matarmaja
5172522 kan ada 17 jadwal keberangkatan disini di stasiun senen baik kelas bisnis maupun ekonomi dan kita masih melayani penjualan tiket langsung untuk keberangkatan malam nanti jadi sepertinya normal saja untuk liburan kali ini tidak ada penambahan jumlah penumpang yang signifikan
5172523 ternyata belum bisa baru bisa sebulan sebelumnya katanya nanti mulai dijual tanggal 27 agustus saya takut kehabisan
5172524 biasanya pada mudik itu paling cepat 10 hari sebelum lebaran makanya tanggal 20 besok kita sudah persiapan pasang tenda antrean selain itu 6 loket antrean juga sudah kita siapkan biar tertib nanti satu loket bisa diantre 25 orang jadi sekali masuk ada 150 orang sisanya menunggu di tenda antrean
5172525 jadi nggak bisa kalo mintanya satu lembar tiket untuk satu nomor tempat satu lembar tiket untuk dua nomor tempat ini juga salah satu bentuk meminimkan penjualan tiket oleh para calo
5172526 kalau di stasiun pantauan kita melihat kalau ada yang hari ini keliatan besok keliatan beli tiket lagi patut dicurigai untuk yang beli tiket jumlah banyak misalnya 10 juga harus dengan izin kepala stasiun

5172544 only recently did she start to talk about things in korea and the atrocities that existed then
5172545 she said the nuns would spread it on bread for the children it was pure protein and saved their lives
5172546 she was the single most influential person in my life
5172547 we both retired within a few years of getting married we had 27 years of 24 hours a day together and it was wonderful
5172548 mary had a masters degree in nursing but she was a chain smoker she smoked two or three packs a day and she could not quit
5172549 she thought they were ridiculing the korean war but later she became a big fan she understood it better
5172550 the law of karma takes effect when the ego arises
5172551 eight wins is not acceptable our coaching staff has let us know that and the players really believe in that
5172552 we definitely knew going into the offseason that we were going to work a little harder trying to get ready for this season because were not going to let that happen again
5172553 it probably was a little bit of a distraction and a little bit of a roller coaster not only for the players but the coaches because youre handling a lot of things in between football that you normally wouldnt be talking about at the same time
5172554 we kinda got back to the mindset of hey we gotta go out and have fun playing this because i think there was a lot of people who were mentally and physically tired because of everything we went through
5172555 its a difference between a saturday scrimmage where i would have had it off and would have been able to sit for five hours and evaluate it i was flying down to blakes hometown to talk to him about it when youve got 29 practices to get ready for a ballgame and you need every minute you can
5172556 one thing i like about this team is that we dont have a couple superstars
5172557 last year we had tommy blake and chase ortiz and both of them were tremendous football players i think this year were more of just a blue collar go out work hard play hard kind of team i think that suits us a lot better
5172558 it kind of feels like the same way when we came off my freshman year in 2004 when we went 5 6 and i was redshirting
5172559 it feels the same the chemistry is real good everybody understands now that the seasons not always going to be 11 2 or 11 1 for us to get there we kinda have to work at it
5172560 we have to work harder to get them in the door and satisfy them its about capturing their attention
5172561 its about girls seeing celebrities on tv shows movies and concert tours and now they get to communicate about clothing on social networking sites more communicating tools are available to spread the word about fashion a celebrity is wearing that drives tween fashion
5172562 a lot of the very fashionable looks right now are very modest
5172563 its almost a flashback to looking very demure and proper
5172564 girls are dressing for themselves as opposed to dressing for guys
5172565 the guys might not like it but the girls are not wearing really tight shirts theyre covered up
5172566 there really is no such thing as a perfect marriage and if they say they are then they are not telling the truth
5172567 just having spoken with high school counselors this fall semester it was frightening and disheartening to hear how many young girls were coming back to school expecting
5172568 ive learned to listen more communicate more ive learned how to appreciate more ive discovered that i didnt know what i thought i knew
5172569 you act like you know that person but you dont you really dont but i know my husband now and i thank god for that i know its going to be a better relationship from now on after we walk out those doors its going to be better
5172570 we encourage everybody to know each other for 4 seasons before you marry them because after you have been with someone for 4 seasons it could end up not being the person you are going to marry
5172571 they have the vision of oh this is my shining knight in armor and hes going to carry me away and were going to live happily ever after without one of these courses they dont stand a chance
5172572 for clinicians the message from our study is that a lack of energy is widespread in the elderly but its not normal
5172573 no one has said its because of the economy but we had 14 000 people in july
5172574 in times of economic uncertainty everybody tends to use the library more
5172575 im seeing an interesting trend it seems like a lot of people are coming in to check out dvds any kind of dvds
5172576 its not so much of the shushing as before we have a childrens room a separate section for musical programs
5172577 historically yes people do use the library more than when they have less disposable income
5172578 weve had more use but i dont know if its attributable to the economy
5172579 im more conscientious about my travel patterns i plan errands the gas station the library the county stores and home a loop
5172580 weve been busy weve been constantly busy every day and our circulation statistics have been up all summer

5172594 we had to leave our entire life on that 10 acre plot
5172595 i lost my business im unemployed because i have emotional blowouts my mother moved in with us we were sleeping on the floor in the lounge until she managed to get her own place
5172596 and all we got from the police was nothing yet we were never phoned once by police we had to call them all the time leigh my common law wife spent years trying and trying as my mother and i were swallowed by depression but nothing has come of it
5172597 on the night i had to stand with a hosepipe leading from the garden into the house to wash away pieces of my dads brain
5172598 the men had tried to shoot my mother but the bullet missed her and ricocheted off the wall i picked up the casing in the driveway and i picked up the bullet on the carpet in the living room i handed them over to the police because they didnt find it i dont think they handled this case properly at all they just left it it was absolute rubbish
5172599 he was 14 at the time that was four years ago he is 18 now juvenile or not the bastard must go to prison
5172600 they are extremely quick to track someone who has stolen something especially if it money related
5172601 it was an absolute tragedy for them to find their daughter like that
5172602 a man who sold fresh eggs and milk was tied up and shot he was one of many others
5172603 my fathers murder was treated just like all the others just another murder
5172604 its like no one wants to investigate anything in the south it just gets ignored
5172605 what still gets us is that the bugger was caught but nothing was done about it
5172606 life is so damn cheap to be killed for nothing in a place where he was respected and considered a gentleman my god thats what is most disgusting
5172607 and then you get turned away constantly by the police
5172608 its one murder but the lives of everyone around him have been knocked out of kilter
5172609 i know that it is the four year anniversary of the death of my dad
5172610 everyday when i change the calendar i look at my dad and say a few words to him
5172611 im now in tottenham but no one can disagree with me wanting to follow my dream
5172612 we have two more weeks until the end of the transfer window and i think this will be the most important week i read alex fergusons statement that he wants another striker and i hope that this striker is dimitar berbatov
5172613 if i had been laughing when i was on the bench people would say i was an idiot

5172616 after a long drawn out war b town is breathing a sigh of relief kareena and bipasha have patched up guests at saifs birthday party held at four seasons in worli were shocked to see bipasha walking in with ranbir kapoor it is learnt that kareena had decided to forget the past and in her typically emotional way invited bips personally for the party bebo has been telling everybody that bips looked the hottest in race when kareena called bips was pleasantly surprised by kareenas warmth and immediately accepted the invite at the party kareena and bipasha were seen chatting and bonding
5172617 since the last one year there has been a distinct mellowing of attitudes between bipasha and kareena last week when kareena saw bachna ae haseeno she messaged bips saying she had loved her performance in the film that broke the ice and then bebo invited bips to saifs party bips too has been praising bebos talent so the patch up was all but inevitable
5172618 yes its true that kareena personally invited me to their party it was very sweet of her and we all enjoyed it a lot

5172623 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
5172624 democrats in florida and michigan must know they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
5172625 but i certainly want to make sure that weve got michigan and florida delegates at the convention in some fashion
5172626 our main goal is to get this resolved so we can focus on winning michigan and florida
5172627 there were compromises im glad the dnc worked it through and i hope we can start focusing on substance as opposed to process
5172628 the ironic thing is obama had the majority of that committee
5172629 the obama campaign wants to move on and compromise we did not muscle our way through it it was a wise decision from a well run and wise campaign that will reverberate

5172635 this year hasnt given us much encouragement but we were hoping he could because hes a sort of slightly built guy who doesnt seem to take a lot of work but were hypothesising and speculating
5172636 hes doing a little bit of what shaun hart used to do and nigel lappin used to do
5172637 when you watch him play a game he runs really hard itd be an interesting study just to watch him how hard he runs and its a lesson to all our players to be honest
5172638 hes been incredible really how hes just been linking up and getting to the right spot when we need someone to run into space its been a really good first month

5172649 this little higher number is probably the result of lower gas prices the economy remains pretty weak and consumer sentiment reflects that

5172684 it has been really lovely to have my first professional job to see what this industry is all about
5172685 it has really given me a taster and spurred me on to do this for the rest of my life hopefully

5172687 there was no theatre anywhere in britain dedicated to musical theatre
5172688 when the opportunity came and the university was looking to refurbish the theatre and reopen it with something the idea came together to make this a hub
5172689 it is not a hub that would do old classic musicals though we have got a few classics but mainly that would look for new work and make new work happen
5172690 it gives the students an experience of working as a rep company and what it is like

5172694 the role of justice in the aftermath of massive human rights violations
5172695 the topic is timely and we have perhaps the best person to talk about it with us here
5172696 justice can help a society recover from massive human rights violations
5172697 unfortunately too much is expected from justice it is only one tool amongst many
5172698 i am happy to say that from the first minute i arrived first week of december 1994 i have received cooperation friendship and support from the government of rwanda
5172699 i have had fourteen visits to rwanda and i remember them all with happy memories of friendship and cooperation
5172700 it would be nothing short of a tragedy if misunderstandings are not fixed
5172701 it is my great hope and expectation that security for the lawyers should not be any problem at all
5172702 i had some european and north american countries telling me not to use the g word this was no genocide this was spontaneous tribalism this is what happens in africa
5172703 it will go down in history as a first systematic record of criminal justice
5172704 acknowledgement of the historical record is important for the survivors
5172705 why is there fear that a judge or defence lawyer that comes to rwanda would be harmed whereas the perpetrators walk freely on the streets
5172706 what is worrying us is the abuse of this notion which would create legal anarchy in international law

5172714 the isolated actions of a very few over the course of many years
5172715 the federal air marshal service maintains a policy of zero tolerance of retaliation in the workplace against an employee for raising a concern or complaint through any established formal or informal process
5172716 unfortunately we are once again largely back to where we started
5172717 since the 1994 amendments 177 whistleblower cases have come before the federal circuit court however
5172718 hopefully the house and senate will roll up their sleeves and iron out their differences to get a final bill

5172727 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5172728 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5172735 its a hybrid of it but the inspiration is definitely there on capote its one of those things that takes him from being an interesting character and i think really does put him over the top and does something hes a favorite among the crew here

5172757 in view of certain developments a decision has been taken that fiji will not attend the forum meeting in niue
5172758 this regrettable and unfortunate situation of fiji not participating in the forum meeting in niue arises because of the decision taken by the government of new zealand
5172759 if thats what hes saying then i suspect that he was looking for an excuse it was not new zealands intention to provide him with an excuse not to come which is why i agreed that he should be able to transit through auckland airport
5172760 i think it speaks volumes if they are not prepared to come and be accountable to forum leaders but obviously we are going to await formal advice as to whether they are coming or not
5172761 sometimes something like that happening can change the internal dynamic at home
5172762 my assessment is that leaders feel that the events in fiji are really casting a stain on the pacific the leaders want to be seen and have the forum be seen to continue to be leading international opinion and action on the issue

5172784 in the next five years theres no reason why demand cant stay strong due to bric brazil russia india china economies
5172785 in china there may well be some slower growth but demand for steel continues to very strong and weve still got russia and india going flat out

5172818 its funny earlier this week we heard that one of the reasons banks could not cut mortgage rates was the high returns being paid to savers now we are seeing savings rates falling and the banks still arent cutting rates they are running out of excuses
5172819 single detached starts will fall to a 12 year low in 2008 as builders cope with weaker net migration an overhang of unoccupied new units and relentless competition from an oversupplied resale market rapid price growth from previous years will also cut into demand
5172820 increased competition from the existing home market coupled with the elimination of the pent up demand that built up during the 1990s will exert downward pressure on housing starts which will decline to 194 000 units in 2009 from 215 000 in 2008

5172823 afghanistan has to try to have good relations with you but if your government continues a reversed policy the afghans will be obliged to kill your nationals in revenge for their brothers their sisters and their children events such as logar will happen again because occupied afghanistan looks at all actors that are established in the interest of america with an eye of hostility
5172824 therefore you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans
5172825 we know that the taliban will use any means to further their terrorist goals i expect the government of canada to do everything to protect the brave civilians who are doing all they can to help the afghan people
5172826 this letter is a disgusting attempt to justify the deliberate killings of innocent civilians there is no justification for these killings by the taliban
5172827 canada is in afghanistan at the request of the democratically elected government of that country canadians are part of a un sanctioned nato led coalition that is attempting to bring stability and security to the people of afghanistan we will continue to fight for these goals we will continue to protect the afghan people from these ruthless killers

5172886 believing in fate is how some people live their lives and it can work
5172887 when free will is taken out of the equation the passivity can prevent one or both people from going after what they truly want out of a relationship in this scenario fate can be classified as settling

5172915 as the body of the 114th british soldier to die in afghanistan is prepared for the saddest journey home the palace proudly announces that prince william will spend the final months of his so called military service playing at being a member of the sas i dont blame william but could there be a greater insult to the fighting men who risk their lives in the service of their country
5172916 the fault lies with the palace spin doctors trying to improve the princes playboy image alas their recent attempts have been beyond parody first there was williams stint with the raf where his most notable achievement was to earn his wings by flying a helicopter to a stag weekend then came the sheer silliness of his time with the royal navy in the er hellhole of the caribbean where we were told that the prince had played a vital part in the capture of drug pirates i e watched through binoculars while others did the dirty work soon well be told that william has earned the admiration of his sas colleagues by taking part in some daring enterprise the siege of boujis perhaps
5172917 i know its easy to mock but thats precisely the problem you would have thought that williams advisers would have realised by now that this extended gap year has done nothing to enrich the reputation of our future king quite the opposite it has repeatedly held him up to ridicule by all accounts william is in fact an intelligent and likeable young man what he desperately needs is a proper job the very thing his self pitying father never had

5172921 when the u s first attacked iraq i was told by my president that it was because of direct ties to al qaida and weapons of mass destruction

5172923 yeah if it came down to that id be willing to go to prison because i know i did the right thing and i can sleep at night and my conscience is still good
5172924 i support robin long because he is a soldier of conscience there is a huge propaganda campaign in this country to get young men to join the military he bought the hype he signed up for a promised non combat job but it turned out not to be so he decided to go to canada and follow his conscience instead
5172925 in considerably good spirits especially considering all that he is going through
5172926 aware of what he might have to face and is prepared to face it with courage and without bitterness

5173028 im with you a lanevski for what its worth i first thought of you and your logo i mean how many people would come up with that idea
5173029 i arranged to have the summer off but im learning that in academics that just means that ive had the luxury of not starting anything new
5173030 it is a total shock to the system i thought getting this degree would give me more choices more flexibility and though the work is more interesting than if i didnt have the degree there are far fewer jobs now that i have it and there is also an expectation that i move away from seattle to follow a job
5173031 im scared that flexible is going to mean any 80 hours a week i want
5173032 people always think that i am a hard worker and really motivated
5173033 especially now one friend said recently that she is sure that i am the type of person who hates being bored truth is im really quite lazy i do well with short spurts of work but i think i would do just fine without the stimulation of a high powered career i would cook raise babies write read learn some photography be a good friend renew my campaign to marry into the british royal family

5173039 he was too thin and seemed to walk in a strange way
5173040 one coach had a good eye and picked him out but he asked lius mother for money the mother was angry and stopped sending liu to the sports school
5173041 later sun haiping visited lius parents and said i dont want money and i will let your child eat the best and most nutritious food and his mother was persuaded to let him go back
5173042 if you guys are going to run stuff and run every lie under the sun have somebody stand up for somebody

5173044 shes one of the most lovely people ive ever met in my life and im going through something thats a very personal thing and you have to give that up you have to give everything up because you cant have it all and it sucks

5173050 but its when we asked respondents about their planned smart phone purchases over the next 90 days that the tsunami like effect of this marketplace transformation becomes crystal clear
5173051 the most likely explanation for such a large scale projected increase in smart phone buyers going forward is the anticipation and publicity surrounding the imminent release of the 3g iphone
5173052 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5173053 for clarification no memo emanated from the leadership on the matter because there was no need to interfere unnecessarily with an issue that had already been settled at the executive session of the house besides the records are clear and anybody can verify with the peugeot automobile of nigeria pan which supplied the cars
5173054 neither the speaker his deputy nor any principal officer of the house had anything to do with the purchase of the cars the essence was to ensure that there was transparency and openness in the activities of the house of representatives
5173055 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5173056 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5173057 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5173058 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5173059 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5173060 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5173061 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5173062 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5173063 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5173064 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5173065 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5173066 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5173067 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5173068 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5173069 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5173070 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5173071 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5173072 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5173073 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5173074 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

5173088 indians and pakistanis came together under one roof to cause havoc in the university
5173089 those are friendships which have lasted me for years and continue until this day
5173090 i have an enormous personal affection for the people of south asia
5173091 ive also had an orientation toward asia and a recognition that over time we are going to see more economic growth
5173092 we have an economy that frankly for the last eight years has been focused on the very few and we have not seen economic growth from the bottom up
5173093 the only way we are going to move beyond these current challenges is not to try to prevent further immigration and integration of our communities
5173094 weve got 79 days before were going to change the country
5173095 i dont need to convince this room of the nature of the changes that are needed weve got an economy that is not working
5173096 a foreign policy that has been based on bluster and bombast
5173097 we are going to go out there and run the best presidential campaign that you have seen we are going to win this election were going to change the country and were going to change the world so keep your stress to a minimum

5173100 id just like to do everything i can trees grow as tall as they can dont they not half as tall
5173101 so badly that he died in hungary in november 1944 the perth magistrates court has been told
5173102 he had recognised this person as someone who resided in budafot mr corboy told the court
5173103 it obviously came as quite a shock we had a pretty close school group were all pretty close
5173104 its going to rock us pretty hard he was just a good bloke
5173105 he was top notch he was a real genuine bloke
5173106 his funeral is going to be absolutely enormous because youd be hard pressed to finding someone who didnt get along well with tom
5173107 tom had been talking about me joining him on this trip for about the last two months
5173108 then he left a message on my facebook telling me he was going down saying sorry about the late notice but im heading down to the snow are you still keen
5173109 i dont check my facebook that regularly and i checked it on saturday and i was like damn i missed out and then this happened
5173110 never shy of a fun time old tommy he was a good social lad
5173111 he was an adventurous one he came up to newcastle not that long ago to do a scuba diving course with his bro and he was big on his skiing
5173112 he was always doing something adventurous he was into rock climbing and any sort of adventure sport
5173113 i know a lot of the boys at the schools were pretty fond of him because he was a young guy that was into rugby and whatnot i think he really got on well with the students that didnt get along with other teachers
5173114 this tragic loss comes at a time when mr carr boyd was just starting out on a promising teaching career
5173115 the school offers its sincere sympathy to mr family and friends
5173116 his place in sydney was a social hub for everyone his doors were always open for guests passing through or staying the night
5173117 he had a similar injury at this same time last year and missed one week and then played in hirds farewell game so the best case scenario is that he could be back for round 22 but it is probably unlikely
5173118 we will get him moving soon and hopefully hes straight line running by the end of the week and we will look at increasing his work after that but if hes no good next week then thats his season
5173119 he will have a couple of screws inserted into his hand and he will miss the season
5173120 we will put a couple of lightweight screws in which means he will be right in five weeks the small screws will hold it still and he will be fine
5173121 he was running along and the fibula simply cracked he thinks he might have gotten a knock earlier and then was running along a heard a crack its very unusual for that to happen
5173122 its just a crack so it will heal on its own but he will be on crutches for the next week and then will wear the moon boot for four weeks or so
5173123 it is a great property but it simply didnt fit into our plans for 2009
5173124 biggest 36 year old cry baby momma of all time
5173125 well you did hit it but then i moved it out of the way
5173126 you cant cheat that is wrong you will end up leading a life of crime and spend your best years in prison
5173127 while it is pleasing to see the government provide much needed assistance and training for our pacific neighbours especially with the injection of money back into their respective communities we must ensure that the guest workers are not exploited
5173128 poor housing and contentious pay deductions are two issues that the greens will be keeping a close eye on
5173129 while this scheme will assist in filling labour shortages in industries such as horticulture we must ensure that this is about training the guest workers in new skills and not taking advantage of cheap labour
5173130 i commend the government on this move and the greens will be looking at the detail closely
5173131 precious and few are the moments we two can share
5173132 we have got the compact discs containing the whole matter of the books from ncert national council of educational research and training normally there is a font size of 12 or 14 in normal books but we will print the books after increasing the font size to 48
5173133 i have also written to ncert to publish such books separately for special students as no one else is doing this it will also help to reduce the cost of publication if they publish it in bulk
5173134 we have conducted a survey among the government school students of chandigarh in the survey we have identified 3 000 students who are partially blind or are suffering with very low vision
5173135 we medically examined them to know the extent of visual impairment depending upon the needs we have distributed spectacles and magnifying glasses to them
5173136 but still there are many students with severe vision problem who can not read properly they are 40 in number and we will distribute all their curriculum books in larger fonts free of cost to them
5173137 even in my school we have identified some students with very low vision they cannot see the black board clearly in spite of sitting in the first row of the class such books will be of great help for both the students and teachers
5173138 this suggests that taste damage from ear infections may alter food choice and thus lead to obesity risk
5173139 this data suggests that there are lingering effects of tonsillectomies on taste nerves and that can affect eating habits
5173140 it obviously came as quite a shock we had a pretty close school group were all pretty close
5173141 its going to rock us pretty hard he was just a good bloke
5173142 he was top notch he was a real genuine bloke
5173143 his funeral is going to be absolutely enormous because youd be hard pressed to finding someone who didnt get along well with tom
5173144 tom had been talking about me joining him on this trip for about the last two months
5173145 then he left a message on my facebook telling me he was going down saying sorry about the late notice but im heading down to the snow are you still keen
5173146 i dont check my facebook that regularly and i checked it on saturday and i was like damn i missed out and then this happened
5173147 never shy of a fun time old tommy he was a good social lad
5173148 he was an adventurous one he came up to newcastle not that long ago to do a scuba diving course with his bro and he was big on his skiing
5173149 he was always doing something adventurous he was into rock climbing and any sort of adventure sport
5173150 i know a lot of the boys at the schools were pretty fond of him because he was a young guy that was into rugby and whatnot i think he really got on well with the students that didnt get along with other teachers
5173151 this tragic loss comes at a time when mr carr boyd was just starting out on a promising teaching career
5173152 the school offers its sincere sympathy to mr family and friends
5173153 his place in sydney was a social hub for everyone his doors were always open for guests passing through or staying the night
5173154 to teach and to hold an administrative post are two different experiences altogether many times when a teacher who has been in the profession for ages is promoted to an administrative post it becomes a challenging task
5173155 this is why i think a course like this which will basically help a teacher cope with the new portfolio and train him or her starting with the most senior teachers first because they are most likely to get promoted first into such a post would be helpful since du conducts so many short term courses from time to time i think this if implemented will be great
5173156 the university officials felt that if professors of the university can help students whether at the undergraduate or postgraduate level improve their language skills then they neednt go to some coaching centre
5173157 the university will charge a minimal fee of rs 2 500 for the entire course forty students have already signed up for the course and now many university staff have also come up to us to conduct similar courses for them
5173158 there are some professors whose lectures in a particular subject are considered the best ill has taken the initiative of having video lectures of those professors in our labs so that all students can take advantage of his or her lectures
5173159 he was in intensive care for a few days and we were in hospital for seven or eight weeks in total
5173160 it is still very dangerous many complications can arise aidans grown up with being in and out of hospital
5173161 he could not eat anything for the first two and a half years of his life he did not have the energy to chew suck or swallow and so he had to have a gastric tube put into his stomach
5173162 he has been to hell and back but hes still able to raise a smile
5173163 even when he was in intensive care he was trying to catch the eye of his doctor and shake his hand
5173164 hes a huge fan of spiderman and when he doesnt want anything done to him he
5173165 he doesnt want to be the centre of attention he just wants to be normal happy and get on with things
5173166 he still has a long way to go but every day is a happy day and we live for each day
5173167 he is a veteran defensive lineman a guy who knows how to play the game
5173168 he is a professional we will see what he is capable of doing and work him out he had a very solid workout and seems to be in pretty good shape so we will continue on him the next couple of weeks and see if he can find a seat on the bus if you will
5173169 i have been around for a while i was used to this defense it will take me a while to get back but i think i can contribute
5173170 so badly that he died in hungary in november 1944 the perth magistrates court has been told
5173171 he had recognised this person as someone who resided in budafot mr corboy told the court

5173174 wanting to get married and not going online will soon be seen as equivalent to trying to find an address by driving around randomly rather than using a map
5173175 the finding is significant because it changes our understanding of how light input from the eye can affect activity and sleep patterns
5173176 this suggests that we have discovered an additional mechanism for regulating nocturnity and diurnity that is located in the light input pathways of the eye
5173177 the significance of this research for humans is that it could ultimately lead to new treatments for sleep disorders perhaps even eye drops that would target neural pathways to the brain s central timekeeper

5173179 after one can it seemed to turn the young individual into one with more of the type of profile you would expect to see with someone with cardiovascular disease
5173180 the last three years have been enormously consequential for telstra and australia with the full privatisation of telstra construction of the worlds largest fastest and most advanced wireless broadband network and the transformation of telstra into the worlds first next generation fully integrated telco
5173181 working in a country and culture not your own is an enormous privilege and working for one of its iconic companies is a privilege amplified
5173182 my time in australia and with telstra has been one of the most memorable experiences of my life both personally and professionally
5173183 i came here expecting to stay for one to two months three years later mary sue and i leave having been welcomed guests in this wonderful country
5173184 it was hard for some to give up the idea that telstra is community property
5173185 the cultural change required by privatisation was difficult both for telstra and for the government
5173186 though we were criticised by some our new approach achieved important results including safeguarding new investments like nextg and adsl2 from value destroying regulation winding back regulation on more than four million copper telephone lines and the reversal of a 1 billion taxpayer gift to singtel optus
5173187 i have always valued phils advice and his principled approach to public policy and communications
5173188 phil has great integrity and has not been afraid to show leadership often speaking the truth even when it was inconvenient for established interests to hear it
5173189 the last three years have been enormously consequential for telstra and australia with the full privatisation of telstra construction of the worlds largest fastest and most advanced wireless broadband network and the transformation of telstra into the worlds first next generation fully integrated telco dr burgess said
5173190 working in a country and culture not your own is an enormous privilege and working for one of its iconic companies is a privilege amplified
5173191 my time in australia and with telstra has been one of the most memorable experiences of my life both personally and professionally the style hunters
5173192 the borjomi gorge is burning following yesterdays firebombing by russian helicopters of the forests in this priceless national park
5173193 the fires were set at about a dozen places and are massive
5173194 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5173195 we are on a clear road towards nato membership for georgia
5173196 i am looking forward to the speedy withdrawal of russian troops which has not yet happened as we had expected
5173197 to show that we support the georgian people and also the government to deal with the work there is to do
5173198 the security zone is temporary this is not disputed by any of the parties
5173199 it is more important that foreign observers arrive so it is not only troops of the commonwealth of independent states cis
5173200 there is no such notion anymore in georgia as russian peacekeepers there can be no russian peacekeepers these are just russian forces
5173201 we have succeeded in upgrading the capabilities of our planes and have increased the range of these planes to 3 000 kilometres 1 860 miles without refuelling
5173202 we do not wish to attack another country but we will defend ourselves should we be attacked
5173203 by hosting these poland is making itself a target this is 100 percent
5173204 it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
5173205 the deployment of new missile defence facilities in europe is aimed against the russian federation
5173206 its a pity that when we are still faced with a most complicated situation to work on the united states is further aggravating the situation in relations with russia
5173207 russia is strong and russia has to be reckoned with
5173208 the unique part of this mission was the incorporation of a maintenance task force from an operational missile wing
5173209 for me the unique part of this launch was seeing all the moving pieces coming together
5173210 we had maintenance and operations teams from up north working together with us in the squadron the coordination we did with the 30th space wing who manages the range as well as the army and the navy who supported the mission downrange
5173211 im very proud of the team of professionals involved in making this test a success
5173212 their technical expertise dedication and adherence to perfection as the standard have ensured our nations icbm fleet is capable and extremely accurate
5173213 for the past 50 years vandenberg has been at the forefront of testing and improving american ballistic missiles
5173214 thanks to the hard work of team vandenberg we continue a proud legacy of assuring the readiness and reliability of our icbm fleet
5173215 ive supported five test launches and with each one i learn more and more about the minuteman iii
5173216 this is a major step forward on the watchkeeper programme and one of a number of trials that are scheduled over the forthcoming months the magic atols system controlled the take off and landing of several of the watchkeeper air vehicle flights without the need for gps
5173217 i was pleased to have the opportunity to be present on the day and the success of this demonstration is completely due to the close co operation of the thales and elbit teams on the programme
5173218 we are very pleased that the gao has upheld the navys source selection decision for the bams uas program
5173219 this reaffirms that northrop grummans offering was selected as the best value determination in a fair and open competition we look forward to getting back to work on this critical program for our navy customer
5173220 as they have every day since they arrived a week ago only to come back a few hours later
5173221 are always coming out in small groups and we dont know how many are inside
5173222 i think that if there had not been russian air forces then yes we had a chance
5173223 we couldnt handle it the troops were very well prepared but the air forces of russia destroyed everything
5173224 the first time the plane missed then suddenly we saw it again and it was shooting and dropping bombs i was wounded from the shrapnel
5173225 i was wounded by a plane it was a bomb i think the shrapnel went in my shoulder and in my back
5173226 it would be better if my friends were here who have died
5173227 before going we were very proud but now we are not so proud
5173228 russian air superiority was crucial the georgians were unable to cope with their air defense system
5173229 georgia had only tactical air defense anti aircraft guns ground to air missiles which was insufficient for a short period the ground troops were being protected but in the long term it was not enough
5173230 if we had had fighter jets maybe the russians would not have had such superiority
5173231 without a doubt there was absolutely nothing we could do against them the russians once the planes were sent in
5173232 aviation played the main role the soldiers told me that everything went wrong as soon as the planes moved in
5173233 the operation was well organised but the conception of our army the type of weapons bought by our army and the type of priorties we had was not that well thought out
5173234 we concentrated on infantry and tanks which are of no use if they dont have proper cover from the air
5173235 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5173236 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5173237 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5173238 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5173239 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5173240 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5173241 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet
5173242 ive put in applications everywhere for everything but nobody wants to hire you if you have been indicted
5173243 my faith in the system is shaken theres no doubt about that
5173244 there are no bodies no forensic evidence no crime scene and no identities
5173245 will look and sound old and weak next to obama
5173246 a lot of evils been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil
5173247 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
5173248 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
5173249 yes yes and find bad teachers another line of work
5173250 you know were going to end this youre answering so quickly you want to play a game of poker
5173251 my friends we spent 3 million of your money to study the dna of bears in montana
5173252 now i dont know if that was a paternity issue or a criminal issue
5173253 before symptoms develop and you become aware of the bugs presence it has already begun to attack your cells similarly fish and other organisms are affected by contaminants before behavioral changes appear our technology detects heretofore undetectable changes to act as an early warning system
5173254 this means the technology could not only help monitor environmental quality but may be used to enforce important water quality standards
5173255 this study was all the more exciting to be a part of due to its potential applications in protecting human health
5173256 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5173257 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program have been a subject of iaea discussions and are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5173258 the safir ambassador rocket was successfully launched all its systems are iranian made
5173259 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in future
5173260 when i heard she had died i just couldnt take it in
5173261 i just couldnt believe it it just couldnt have been true
5173262 people were all too happy to help the campaign and we received lots of supportive words
5173263 if all this saves the life of just one other persons child its all been worth it they wont have to go through what weve been through
5173264 the driver who killed rachel ward cannot be punished again but it gives the courts the chance to imprison people where death is caused by careless driving
5173265 the wards were denied justice but their campaign means that other families can get justice in the future
5173266 where carelessness causes a death it is right that the driver should face tough penalties
5173267 rachel was a very similar person to me if she wanted something she would work and work at it and see it through to the end
5173268 the uk is totally committed to meeting international obligations and goes further than oecd anti bribery convention requirements in many area
5173269 on top of this we will bring forward a draft bribery bill for parliamentary scrutiny in the next session to reform and modernise our law
5173270 we urge you to support measures that would avert further damage to the already beleaguered global non proliferation and disarmament regime
5173271 the japanese foreign ministry must realise that this agreement would be the start of the collapse of the non proliferation regime
5173272 japan as the only nation to come under nuclear attacks must clearly argue against it
5173273 een voorwaarde is voor vertrouwensherstel en het creeren van aandeelhouderswaarde op de langere termijn
5173274 hierin past de benoeming van een financieel directeur cfo op het niveau van het uitvoerende bestuur
5173275 in het bijzonder dient fortis gedetailleerd inzicht te geven in de samenstelling en ontwikkeling van de kredietportefeuille
5173276 by hosting these poland is making itself a target this is 100 percent
5173277 it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
5173278 im going to poland to sign a missile defense agreement in the next couple of days after the nato meeting
5173279 we are going to help rebuild georgia into a strong georgian state the russians will have failed in their effort to undermine georgia and we will be looking at what we can do with the states around that region as well
5173280 the positive effect of an x linked gene on female fecundity tends to outweigh the negative effect of the gene on male fecundity

5173286 instead of alleging concrete injury plaintiffs assert a generalised grievance with a particular government policy
5173287 whether this case should be dismissed for lack of standing
5173288 will experience further job displacement denials of job opportunities wage depression and increase d job competition by a dhs estimate of 12 000 to 30 000 foreign workers
5173289 that granting the preliminary injunction is consistent with the public interest in preserving jobs and wages for american workers
5173290 would cause extreme hardship to lawfully present guest students such as being forced out of status and facing deportation
5173291 i thought of the songs that i would listen to growing up of the memories attached to some of the old stuff that my parents were playing and of the feelings attached to those memories
5173292 i thought it would be really cool to have a record that explores the different eras of soul music
5173293 i remember hearing it and thinking thats a dope song and hes canadian
5173294 portuguese for sunglasses which brown picked up not from the portuguese speaking furtado but from her own exposure to capoeira the brazilian martial arts discipline
5173295 the general consensus was your songs sound too mature for your look
5173296 i did voiceovers commercials worked on sessions in studios anything i did to survive was music related
5173297 im not stupid i think i can figure the rest of it out for myself thank you
5173298 next time i need help i will call on you
5173299 they are just going through normal growth and they are out of the bubble picture
5173300 when i read about the national real estate market i feel fortunate i am in austin
5173301 our highs are not as high and our lows are not as low
5173302 there are a lot of places where you didnt have flipping of real estate
5173303 since you didnt have the price appreciation you dont have the price correction
5173304 brandon gorins shoulder injury is a little more severe than originally diagnosed
5173305 it was not misdiagnosis they were continuing to study the mri and those things and he has a pretty significant shoulder injury
5173306 i dont really understand what i did i have no words to describe the feeling i have in this moment it is difficult to believe that i have won four consecutive titles i just want to enjoy this moment
5173307 right now i feel a little disappointed that i lost
5173308 but this is a normal feeling after losing a match overall i am very happy to have played my first atp final in my career
5173309 i was shocked that so many people in england objected in all the time he has been in prison he has never had a visit from anyone in his family or any letters
5173310 the vietnamese are deporting gary but after that he is a free man if he wants to get off in bangkok that is up to him
5173311 on average only one third of thefts committed on police premises were solved
5173312 im trying to remain upbeat as tom selleck said who the hell is indiana jones anyway
5173313 jaimerais me coucher dans un cube blanc avec des pots de peintures de toutes les couleurs en attendant le moment parfait pour tout lancer sur les murs et enfin me sentir bien
5173314 j tais l seule nue dans mon lit parce que cest comme a que je dors le mieux et que je narrivais pas dormir j coutais de la musique souvrir les veines question de plonger le couteau un peu plus loin pour voir si je peux traverser mon corps entier et tre encore vivante je fixais le plafond de ma chambre je savais que jagissais comme un clich mais a restait confortable alors je suis rest e comme a je faisais des listes de ce que javais faire je fais toujours des listes de ce que jai faire m me si la plupart du temps je passe jamais travers et que je les jette pour faire de nouvelles listes qui vont elles aussi finir dans un fond de poubelle placer en ordre prioritaire des trucs que je ne ferai pas cest une activit ridicule surtout que je my acharne mais jaime bien me faire croire que je suis une fille bien avec un horaire une vie organis e sans faille je me demandais ce que demain allait tre il fallait bien que je me rende l vidence le hasard soccupait bien de moi et me saccageait des milieux de semaine sans avertissement

5173321 i am 58 years old very active until i was afflicted with rheumatoid arthritis

5173324 the implications of our study are not limited to men with prostate cancer
5173325 it gave us the opportunity to have an ethical reason for doing repeat biopsies in just a three month period because they needed that anyway to look at their clinical changes in their prostate cancer
5173326 genes and cells are not living for if they were living they would know no death and would be physiologically imperishable but genes and cells do disorganize and perish genes and cells are the organizations of living intelligent matter that is indestructible this indestructible matter that makes up all genes and cells was first identified by a french medical doctor antione bechamp in the late 19th century and is called the microzyma according to bechamp the microzyma knows no death but only change the change in genes and cells is microzymian change and is initiated by lifestyle and dietary choice
5173327 he was in intensive care for a few days and we were in hospital for seven or eight weeks in total
5173328 it is still very dangerous many complications can arise aidans grown up with being in and out of hospital
5173329 he could not eat anything for the first two and a half years of his life he did not have the energy to chew suck or swallow and so he had to have a gastric tube put into his stomach
5173330 he has been to hell and back but hes still able to raise a smile
5173331 even when he was in intensive care he was trying to catch the eye of his doctor and shake his hand
5173332 hes a huge fan of spiderman and when he doesnt want anything done to him he
5173333 he doesnt want to be the centre of attention he just wants to be normal happy and get on with things
5173334 he still has a long way to go but every day is a happy day and we live for each day

5173336 nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year
5173337 i am playing an unbelievable season no doubt i have to be very happy for everything
5173338 the feeling for sure is very happy for being no 1 but the feeling doesnt change too much because the last years i did very well too it is a satisfaction i want to enjoy these two days probably but later i have to be focused on new york for the us open which begins august 25

5173347 ya dijimos que no bamos a parar de pelear que nos bamos a dejar la piel en la regata por las medallas y alguien nos ha puesto a prueba en unas condiciones terribles tenemos el fruto de pelear como locos
5173348 se han equivocado cuando el viento es tan duro hay que conservar
5173349 nosotros hemos montado el spee para ver que estuviera todo bien y nos quedamos quietos 40 minutos

5173370 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5173371 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5173372 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5173373 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5173374 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5173375 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5173376 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5173383 better black television has been a vision of mine for some years
5173384 ive done a lot to promote and change the way messages are relayed to our children and our families over the last few years promoting positive content and positive messages is so important to educate and preserve the next generation being exposed to positive content is what changed my life i believe that there is a market in our community for a new diverse network that provides a new brand of superior programming that caters to all aspects of television from reality to original programming in addition im excited to be able to expose the urban community to a vast array of jobs in the entertainment community that they might not otherwise be privy to i have a great relationship with bet and mtv and my son and i will continue to do work with them and support their networks with bbtv were spearheading the initiative to meet consumer demand for family friendly hip hop content
5173385 were extremely proud of our programming that will be airing on bbtv
5173386 its extremely important to feed clean quality and positive subject matter to our families
5173387 i remember bob johnson founder of bet telling me back in the day that if you wanted to know real estate youve got to hang out with real estate investors if you wanted to know sports youve got to hang out with athletes i wanted to know tv so i hung out with bob and learned the tv game from one of the best in the business
5173388 jeg skal lige finde mig selv selvom jeg synes at det indtil videre er g et over forventning men det er klart at jeg mangler en del rent offensivt i forhold til det som folk har v ret vant til at se fra min side
5173389 uden at forklejne nordsj lland s er det en klub der er dygtig til at udvikle spillere og hvor man spiller offensivt uden at v re bange for at lade tre fire scoringer g ind i eget m l s dan er det ikke i fck her handler det om at vinde og derfor er min rolle i fck ogs anderledes end den var i nordsj lland d r var jeg mere fri mens jeg her ogs skal t nke den anden vej
5173390 theres not a lot to say really other than bugger the weather was just awful today and when i went round in a car to have a look at how the course was holding up it was obvious that there would be no racing there were rivers running across the course in places and visibility was also poor so it just wasnt happening the rain just wouldnt stop
5173391 its a massive disappointment for everyone not least the club who didnt deserve that and all the fans who were still out there huddling under their umbrellas so i sincerely hope well be back here next year for another go i love the dundrod course and the bikes were working excellently in practice so i reckon we would have been in a shout in all of the races it wasnt to be though so well just have to move on and get stuck in at cadwell its my local circuit so ill be looking for some good results to get things going again
5173392 right now winning races is my priority and my goal in my racing career to stack up as many as i can if we go eight in a row obviously that would be fantastic
5173393 this is the way racing should be this place blows san diego away
5173394 im just really happy to get my second win i didnt think id do well here with my broken collarbone but when we showed up and i went out and qualified third i knew i had a chance
5173395 i was amped up about the session and i wanted to go out there and get that extra point
5173396 i had to settle down and cool out a little bit i ended up getting it done
5173397 im trying to get the championship for the jordan suzuki team
5173398 his is written differently than mine so i thought i had a three second gap
5173399 not that i necessarily want to finish second in the rest of the races but its good to have that option if i need it
5173400 that was a pretty big moment and i knew right then i didnt have the set up to run with mat
5173401 i rode as hard as i could the whole race and didnt make any mistakes and had a quicker pace than yesterday but so did he
5173402 mat just happens to go really good at vir and for some reason i still havent got it figured out the way id like to its a bit frustrating especially since i proved i could get around the place fast in qualifying we searched for a good race set up all weekend and we never found anything i was totally comfortable with we move on to road atlanta to see if we can stop mats streak
5173403 if we go to atlanta and find a good set up and i have a shot at winning then im going to go for the win
5173404 my main goal is the championship though and if that means i have to cruise around in second at road atlanta it wont bother me this series runs from march to september and mat and i have both had our problems this season fortunately when i crashed early this year it didnt cost me as much as his crash did im doing what i need to do to win the title ten years down the road people are going to remember who won the championship and i want to be the one they remember
5173405 when we rolled out for the parade lap the bike seemed pretty good but i never really got on it too hard
5173406 i started from pit lane and started making progress but i ran off the track
5173407 i knew we had a pretty good bike we got up there and were running third for a little bit and then ben bostrom and jake zemke came by we got in a pretty good race with jake and ended up getting him in the end we finished the weekend off strong and im happy for my guys following some frustration early in the superstock race

5173411 thats a pair of faded jeans with zips at the side so that if inconvenient you can convert into shorts
5173412 philip it would be so nice if you just stopped doing bad to others and spend less time confessing because you keep me waiting here and thats not right
5173413 ok relax anna why do u give me so many clarifications on every subject its not needed
5173414 when do i come to see your parents ill go home and tell my parents right away
5173415 not yet i fell in love only once and didnt like any girl thereafter
5173416 frozen moments when destiny makes you re live your life
5173417 the last three years have been enormously consequential for telstra and australia with the full privatisation of telstra construction of the worlds largest fastest and most advanced wireless broadband network and the transformation of telstra into the worlds first next generation fully integrated telco
5173418 working in a country and culture not your own is an enormous privilege and working for one of its iconic companies is a privilege amplified
5173419 my time in australia and with telstra has been one of the most memorable experiences of my life both personally and professionally
5173420 i came here expecting to stay for one to two months three years later mary sue and i leave having been welcomed guests in this wonderful country
5173421 it was hard for some to give up the idea that telstra is community property
5173422 the cultural change required by privatisation was difficult both for telstra and for the government
5173423 though we were criticised by some our new approach achieved important results including safeguarding new investments like nextg and adsl2 from value destroying regulation winding back regulation on more than four million copper telephone lines and the reversal of a 1 billion taxpayer gift to singtel optus
5173424 i have always valued phils advice and his principled approach to public policy and communications
5173425 phil has great integrity and has not been afraid to show leadership often speaking the truth even when it was inconvenient for established interests to hear it
5173426 do you really want me to unleash these on you
5173427 nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year
5173428 i know how difficult it is to win these things and especially here because you only have one chance every four years
5173429 the reason probably i won this title is because i have a fantastic time here enjoying a lot in the village that was amazing experience for me always was a pleasure to know new people no
5173430 i came here especially to see him i am devastasted i just bought one ticket the olympics is over for me as well as liu xiang
5173431 we have started to dream that china could surpass the sporting hegemony of the united states and become world number one in the number of gold medals
5173432 with the upgraded terminal facilities we will be able to offer more of our customers in queensland the choice of using a fuel that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on fossil fuels
5173433 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on
5173434 the selectors have to take the input of both coach and captain before finalising the squad and we have done that before giving a final shape to the squad
5173435 no doubt there were some differences over the selection of some players but it is not new as there have been similar issues the world over
5173436 according to the rules and regulations the selectors are bound to take the input of both coach and captain but giving final shape to the line up is our right
5173437 all the three were included when shafqat naghmi the pcbs chief operating officer confirmed to the selectors that dr shah had cleared them
5173438 i would like to disclose that had dr shahs report not cleared the three cricketers they would not have been selected
5173439 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on
5173440 weve got a wonderful spot on the highway with good visibility and well get some action from virginia center
5173441 not only is he physically foreign emotionally i dont know where i was at that time theres also a certain amount of revulsion involved how could i have looked that young what happened i should have taken more vitamins its totally science fictional
5173442 in striving to experience things you may be rushing the experience that carries with it the seeds of its own displeasure and you have to guard against that
5173443 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on
5173444 im extremely happy to announce new developments which should bring an end to this conflict
5173445 as a result of the discussions that have been going on we can today announce an initiative for professional cycling that has been agreed by the amaury group
5173446 we will also create within the framework of this calendar a ranking system for individual riders teams and nations
5173447 the last three years have been enormously consequential for telstra and australia with the full privatisation of telstra construction of the worlds largest fastest and most advanced wireless broadband network and the transformation of telstra into the worlds first next generation fully integrated telco dr burgess said
5173448 working in a country and culture not your own is an enormous privilege and working for one of its iconic companies is a privilege amplified

5173450 he had recognised this person as someone who resided in budafot
5173451 the president will address the nation at 1 00pm 0700 gmt
5173452 he is a wise man he is a very experienced man and he has seen the writing on the wall
5173453 he has seen the sentiments of not just the elected representatives but various institutions who all asked him to move in a particular way and do not destabilise things here
5173454 his political fate has been sealed whatever he says doesnt matter
5173455 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5173456 i was speaking to a couple of players yesterday theres a lot of uncertainty and there always seems to be these big decisions to be made
5173457 it is an important time for cricket everyone has identified that players and administrators
5173458 but as was the case throughout my career you just take the advice of the experts in the security field and thats what ca and the players association are continuing to do and the players would trust that opinion i have no doubt about that
5173459 the important issue now is for us to work with the icc we are not in the business of going to players and asking their answers prior to us making a decision
5173460 i work very closely with paul marsh the australian cricketers association chief executive and individual players from time to time but we are not deliberately interfering with the players preparation at the moment until we have got something to tell them
5173461 our view is quite simply we need now to see where the icc choose to go with this im sure they will come back to us in the next few days as always we are working with all of our parties and that decision will play itself out in due course
5173462 the icc are the ones who are in control of both the detail and the possible alternative venue so im sure we all understand that its their position now
5173463 las personas tienen que tener derecho a hablar el idioma que mejor les parezca y yo soy partidario en eso de la libertad y del ejercicio de los derechos individuales

5173473 this camp is a good opportunity for us to see the players after their off season break
5173474 most of the players have just started or are about to start their respective domestic competitions and we can now start focusing on the world cup qualifiers which are just around the corner
5173475 with that in mind we will be looking to try a few different things in the match against south africa on tuesday night

5173491 whatever little moral authority was left has now been completely eroded
5173492 this thing must be clear to everyone that president musharraf is not going to resign period
5173493 this is an issue that is not on the table
5173494 we want stability in the country we want political stability

5173497 todo fue un ardid para detenerlo y que no llevara a cabo la manifestaci n un trabajo sucio
5173498 the scene was very tragic the aircraft had come down in the woods there was a clearing where it crashed through
5173499 it was upside down and the top of the roof was crushed one of the engines was some distance away
5173500 it was really very difficult to get into the aircraft we were having to rip off the skin with our hands
5173501 the twin engined aircraft was on quite a low approach to coventry on the normal land path when a smaller aircraft came from the right and the twin engined aircraft struck it side on
5173502 the smaller plane disintegrated immediately and the right engine of the twin aircraft blew up
5173503 whilst we watched the twin engined aircraft bank steeply to the left with smoke coming from its right engine it seemed to level off and climb slightly before dropping steeply down to the left
5173504 i immediately thought it looked like something was wrong then at the last minute just 50 feet up the pilot managed to pull up the nose of the plane
5173505 it looked like he was trying to save the plane from the trees
5173506 but then i realised that the plane was going down and it disappeared into the woods
5173507 it was weird because there was no bang i couldnt believe what i had seen
5173508 two of them were not only commercial pilots but they were also fully qualified instructors they had many many thousands of hours of flying time between them
5173509 it is an absolute tragedy for us because we are a small company we are like a family we know everyone extremely well our thoughts and prayers are with the families
5173510 it had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry
5173511 it was approximately two miles from the runway we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft
5173512 it was a very very routine piece of work and the plane was about to land in a normal routine fashion
5173513 the afghans did not go to canada to kill canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghans to please the fascist regime of america

5173527 when good does evil in its struggle against evil it becomes indistinguishable from its enemies
5173528 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5173529 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5173530 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5173531 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5173532 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5173533 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5173534 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5173535 if i would ask you how fast the american forces can leave iraq the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5173536 the same answer would be toward this situation as soon as we are assured that georgians will not continue to use military force against south ossetians and against abkhazians
5173537 i came here especially to see him i am devastasted i just bought one ticket the olympics is over for me as well as liu xiang

5173540 the president will address the nation at 1 00pm 0700 gmt
5173541 he is a wise man he is a very experienced man and he has seen the writing on the wall
5173542 he has seen the sentiments of not just the elected representatives but various institutions who all asked him to move in a particular way and do not destabilise things here
5173543 his political fate has been sealed whatever he says doesnt matter
5173544 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan

5173546 if you gave me a choice between quinn and derek anderson id go with quinn we just see a bigger upside there
5173547 why are you even asking me this question you cant teach what he has i wouldnt care if i gave up three 1s for quinn
5173548 weve thought quinn was the real deal going through our pre draft evaluations and nothing has changed that but youd have to be suicidal to just throw away a pro bowler for potential thats not how this game works
5173549 29 touchdowns speak louder than any potential somebody else might have
5173550 i wish we had that problem but if i had to choose one quinn for the upside in the long term but if we had to win this year probably go with anderson
5173551 nobody knows what we have in anderson and quinn not us for the most part and not anybody whos outside of this organization and doesnt see them on a day to day basis those scouts can think what they want but only how this plays out this season is gonna tell us what happens in 2009
5173552 this camp is a good opportunity for us to see the players after their off season break
5173553 most of the players have just started or are about to start their respective domestic competitions and we can now start focusing on the world cup qualifiers which are just around the corner
5173554 with that in mind we will be looking to try a few different things in the match against south africa on tuesday night

5173560 if he owes it i reckon he should pay it
5173561 i was speaking to a couple of players yesterday theres a lot of uncertainty and there always seems to be these big decisions to be made
5173562 it is an important time for cricket everyone has identified that players and administrators
5173563 but as was the case throughout my career you just take the advice of the experts in the security field and thats what ca and the players association are continuing to do and the players would trust that opinion i have no doubt about that
5173564 the important issue now is for us to work with the icc we are not in the business of going to players and asking their answers prior to us making a decision
5173565 i work very closely with paul marsh the australian cricketers association chief executive and individual players from time to time but we are not deliberately interfering with the players preparation at the moment until we have got something to tell them
5173566 our view is quite simply we need now to see where the icc choose to go with this im sure they will come back to us in the next few days as always we are working with all of our parties and that decision will play itself out in due course
5173567 the icc are the ones who are in control of both the detail and the possible alternative venue so im sure we all understand that its their position now

5173573 we need to take a serious look at the kind of wasteful expenditure that has gone on around the olympic games
5173574 now makhenkesi stofile the minister of sport and recreation seems to have wasted r11 million of taxpayers money on a publicity expo for south africa
5173575 the organisation of the expo has been a shambles sic we urge the portfolio committee on sport to summon the department to explain why so much money has been squandered on an opportunity to market our country

5173579 shines a harsh and frankly unflattering light on the attitudes we canadians have concerning mental health
5173580 in some ways mental illness is the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination
5173581 we call some things mental illness because it gives some people an excuse for poor behaviour and personal failings
5173582 i wish i could say i was knocked off my feet i wish i could say this came as a huge surprise and disappointment
5173583 the reality is in 21st century canada that it doesnt
5173584 if somebody said to you they had a pain in their stomach you wouldnt assume it was fake you would assume they had a problem and had to get it looked at
5173585 people arent willing to recognize that mental illness is a genuine illness
5173586 an almost religious judgment of people involved with alcohol or drugs as sinners
5173587 there are all kinds reasons why people fall prey to these problems
5173588 the other teams didnt want to play with him anymore for fear that if they had a cut they would get infected
5173589 accounts for a very small minority of all of violence in our society
5173590 as visible as the person on the street corner who is sleeping on a grate and hallucinating is in the downtown core of any city there is also an invisible army of people walking to work in the office towers around that grate who themselves have also experienced some form of mental illness and substance abuse who have recovered who are back in the workforce who are back with their families

5173611 in the 1990s after the fall of the soviet empire a few entrepreneurs made vast fortunes in markets for oil and other primary resources
5173612 yet post soviet russia is a miserable place in which only about one in five citizens say they are very happy about their lives
5173613 some development economists believe that case of a few lucky entrepreneurs suddenly amassing large fortunes raised unreasonable expectations among ordinary russians creating a sense of extreme unfairness and leaving them deeply dissatisfied with their meager lot

5173654 no matter what im going to give all the happiness in the world since i think the world of her she deserves it its her prerogative to receive all the love and affection that she missed due to me during these three months he quickly took her to their bedroom made her lie down and sprinkled some water on her translucent skin her eyes wrinkled a bit her eyeballs moved abruptly left and right whilst her eyes closed she opened her eyes wit the brightness of the sun in her eyes and gradually she saw a pale face of mark she opened her eyes wide to believe it she saw him stunned he saw her lovingly and kissed her forehead gently to make her realize its the real him they both hugged each other crying bitterly they kissed they looked into each others eyes got lost for sometime remembered the times they enjoyed when they were inseparable once upon a time mark couldnt enjoy his training since he had to be out of the city most of the time this moment proved to them that silence speaks marks silence was understood by andrea mark gave andrea a loving passionate pierce look and finally broke the silence sweetheart i dont know why i was not able to pick up the phone and talk to you perhaps thats how i am usually a free flowing river full of fast current overflowing with excitement but at times these calm patches the blooming river gets quiet it stands still thats how i define myself i am made up of my own arrogance and my own polite self i am strong yet weak i win but i do lose for few moments at times but i know that i will emerge as a winner andreas cheeks became soggy with tears she admired mark for everything he did she realized mark also loved her and he would have definitely missed her wherever he must have been so many questions so many doubts andrea just did not know when and how to start its time to leave now mark thought he didnt know how was he going to put it across to andrea he silently started packing his bag and looked for some thing around the room which he couldnt figure out what exactly did he want he asked andrea for a pair of socks andrea was now resting in the other room when she got a faint idea that mark was actually packing his bag but why would he do that she asked herself she couldnt control the suspense and preferred coming out to the living room seeing for herself to see what was happening out there she came rushing to the living room breaking through the glass door she got a cut in her elbow and yelled with pain but immediately her attention was diverted towards mark who was so engrossed with his clothes and accessories she went to him closely mark was so oblivious to his surrounding that he didnt realize she was now so close to him she caressed his hair with both the hands resting her bruised elbow on his shoulders and murmured mark are you leaving me again her teary eyes made mark uncomfortable and gave her a small peck on the lips he said baby i am going so that i can come early i want to be present when our little one is born

5173732 we have copied nature taking the elements and mechanisms found in plant life that have evolved over 3 billion years and recreated one of those processes in the laboratory
5173733 the breakthrough came when we coated a proton conductor called nafion onto an anode to form a polymer membrane just a few micrometres thick which acts as a host for the manganese clusters
5173734 normally insoluble in water when we bound the catalyst within the pores of the nafion membrane it was stabilised against decomposition and importantly water could reach the catalyst where it was oxidized on exposure to light
5173735 whilst man has been able to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for years we have been able to do the same thing for the first time using just sunlight an electrical potential of 1 2 volts and the very chemical that nature has selected for this purpose
5173736 we need to continue to learn from nature so that we can better master this process
5173737 the production of hydrogen using nothing but water and sunlight offers the possibility of an abundant renewable green source of energy for the future for communities across the world
5173738 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimise for those properties
5173739 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5173740 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modelling can do
5173741 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution
5173742 a neurons excitability whether it will fire hinges on this delicate equilibrium
5173743 finding statistically robust associations linked to two proteins that may be involved in regulating such ion channels and that are also thought to be targets of drugs used to clinically to treat bipolar disorder is astonishing
5173744 faced with little agreement among previous studies searching for the genomic hot spots in bipolar disorder these researchers pooled their data for maximal statistical power and unearthed surprising results improved understanding of these abnormalities could lead to new hope for the millions of americans affected by bipolar disorder
5173745 as the conflict in georgia unfolded over the past week and a half the bush administration has found itself battling a familiar charge that its response to a major crisis was slow and uncertain the presidents hesitance to roundly and immediately condemn russias aug 8 invasion stood in contrast to the response of the two major presidential candidates some observers said mr bush was unassertive when he needed to be bold white house aides have dismissed criticisms publicly and privately arguing that mr bush and his top national security officials have been dealing with events from the start and that a president must speak carefully during international crises until reports can be verified they noted that the president sharpened his words last week as the invasion continued
5173746 religion easily has the best bullshit story of all time think about it religion has convinced people that theres an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do every minute of every day and the invisible man has a list of 10 specific things he doesnt want you to do and if you do any of these things he will send you to a special place of burning and fire and smoke and torture and anguish for you to live forever and suffer and burn and scream until the end of time but he loves you he loves you he loves you and he needs money

5173752 afghanistan has to try to have good relations with you but if your government continues a reversed policy the afghans will be obliged to kill your nationals in revenge for their brothers their sisters and their children events such as logar will happen again because occupied afghanistan looks at all actors that are established in the interest of america with an eye of hostility
5173753 therefore you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans
5173754 we know that the taliban will use any means to further their terrorist goals i expect the government of canada to do everything to protect the brave civilians who are doing all they can to help the afghan people
5173755 this letter is a disgusting attempt to justify the deliberate killings of innocent civilians there is no justification for these killings by the taliban
5173756 canada is in afghanistan at the request of the democratically elected government of that country canadians are part of a un sanctioned nato led coalition that is attempting to bring stability and security to the people of afghanistan we will continue to fight for these goals we will continue to protect the afghan people from these ruthless killers

5173766 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
5173767 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
5173768 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
5173769 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
5173770 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
5173771 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the will not be affected by this change
5173772 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
5173773 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
5173774 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
5173775 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
5173776 rick ross orchestrated a brutal attack upon dj vlad carried out at his direction by his accomplices in retribution for media coverage of
5173777 painstakingly created his public persona to be that of a major drug dealer and gangster but is in reality a former correctional officer
5173778 ive been hearing things about me on your web site we gonna make a story we going to see each other we going to talk where are you
5173779 following a brief conversation between dj vlad and ross in which ross said we got beef ross accomplices who had surrounded dj vlad while he spoke with ross proceeded to strike and beat dj vlad in ross presence and without any protest on ross part
5173780 has it come to this has the magical impact of george lucas original vision of star wars been reduced to the level of saturday morning animation
5173781 its a deadening film that cuts corners on its animation and slumbers through a plot that a makes us feel like weve seen it all before and b makes us wish we hadnt
5173782 we saw this in a theater full of kids and there wasnt a single moment that caused spontaneous cheering
5173783 ziro the hutt is perhaps the most bizarre character ever created in the series history yes including jar jar a jabba shaped slug who wears face paint and feathers the creature speaks english rather than huttese except that he she somehow has the accent of truman capote by way of eric cartman of south park
5173784 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally
5173785 the character was so bad so incredibly awful that it was a slap to the face it is many times worse than im actually describing this character was actually too much for me
5173786 after meeting ahsoka we really understand why he killed all the younglings id have done it with my bare hands she calls him skyguy which is amazingly annoying and he calls her snips
5173787 of course the anakin ahsoka relationship is made impossibly awkward by the fact that shes half naked and 12 and that theyre always in close quarters i dont need the force to see this fan fiction coming
5173788 the contractors are still working here and we will want to be talking to them to ascertain how it became flooded and why it didnt clear itself quickly as well as to make sure that this sort of thing doesnt happen in future

5173822 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
5173823 it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit but it was really cool and she was happy
5173824 britney and kevin wanted to settle but there were issues of how much time we wanted and there was an upcoming court hearing scheduled
5173825 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
5173826 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that senator mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
5173827 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5173828 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5173829 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5173830 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5173831 and i aint no preacher but heres my erick sermon

5173853 i just kind of sat there for a minute and it didnt go away and i was like oh no it really did scare me the way the pain was running all the way up my leg i hadnt rolled my ankle since high school and that didnt feel like this
5173854 his arm action is the same on every pitch and thats what makes it so tough
5173855 i made some bad pitches and they hit them hard
5173856 i expect better and ill get back at it tomorrow
5173857 my clients wish that they hadnt had to bring this lawsuit they would have greatly preferred to be working inside the justice department where by all rights they deserved to be defending the government in court rather than standing as victimized examples of government wrongdoing
5173858 reveal defendant department of justices utterly unredeemable obliviousness to its legal obligations and its remarkably recidivistic failures to meet them in the first place
5173859 this was an extraordinary and uniquely successful conspiracy to achieve political results that required the gross deprivation of hundreds of individuals constitutional rights for which defendant gonzales was legally most responsible
5173860 we have no idea why the six plaintiffs in this case were not selected for the departments extraordinarily competitive honors program and summer law intern programs except that it had nothing to do with monica goodling a fact that the evidence will bear out in court
5173861 this is a continuum that started back on 9 11 to reform law enforcement and the intelligence community to focus on the terrorism threat
5173862 it moves what the rules were from 1993 to the new world we live in but it maintains civil liberties
5173863 provide specialized equipment technical knowledge or assistance of expert personnel
5173864 if properly implemented this should assure the public that people are not being investigated by agencies who are not trained in how to protect constitutional rights
5173865 the fbi will need to be vigilant both in its policies and its practices to live up to that promise
5173866 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
5173867 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
5173868 in the right direction however the vagueness of the provisions giving broad access to criminal intelligence to undefined agencies is very troubling
5173869 the new record of travellers is a positive indication that the new visa rules and regulations have been implemented to increase the number of visitors to the country
5173870 the government will continue to have a strict stance against all aspects of corruption and will take legal measures against violators
5173871 dubai government follows a transparent and clear policy on such issues there are strict directives to have zero tolerance towards all aspects of corruption bribing and taking advantage of official positions
5173872 any employee exploiting his position to make illegal profits will not have immunity the strictness with which some violations that emerged in the recent past were dealt with confirms the governments commitment to maintaining the highest global standards in fighting corruption and enhancing its achievements in the economic financial and legislative fields
5173873 the government has created an ideal environment here which is supported by a legal and legislative structure that depends on the best global practices the government will continue this policy which made it gain the confidence of business leaders throughout the region and the world there will be no tolerance shown to anybody who tries to exploit his position to make illegal profits
5173874 there is a consistent interest in using ebb and flow movements and river outlets to generate power by letting large amounts of water flow into thin canals this increases water flow greatly but also contributes to environmental problems
5173875 as a result scientists thought about using coastal tides fence extensions were extended in the canals between small islands this was an effective measure as opposed to putting these fences along river banks
5173876 this method worked in some areas in the country but it is seasonal and relies heavily on rain and rising water levels which does not make it very useful
5173877 there have been studies conducted about using heat from the earths core
5173878 this making it possible to cover world energy needs for the next 100 000 years the only problem is converting such energy into electric power involves very high costs studies are still continuing to ensure the success of this project
5173879 we are confident that the thurayalocate service will be a positive step forward in aiding all our customers to report where they are and to travel safely thanks to the foresight of thuraya from its inception every mobile handset we have ever made contains a gps positioning system this is unique not only in the satellite world but in conventional gsm mobiles as well we are delighted to be working more with geonix one of our independent third party developers and believe todays announcement further reaffirms the strength of our 3rd party developer programme
5173880 from the streets of london through the deserts of the middle east to the australian outback thurayalocate can let you and anyone you designate to know where you are and that you are safe
5173881 vat has not yet been approved the government is studying the impact and wants to know all the positives and negatives so it might not do it at all may be by 2010
5173882 all the details and the date of introducing the new taxation system are yet to be finalised at the federal level
5173883 if we reach the point where it might come into effect that means we have to study all the procedures because it will affect the customs union and it will affect even the whole customs work in the uae al marri was quoted as saying
5173884 as vat is going to replace the current customs duties amounting to five per cent it will ensure price stability and help check further rise in inflation
5173885 the vat system would not have any negative effect on our inflation rates
5173886 there is a consistent interest in using ebb and flow movements and river outlets to generate power where large amounts of water flow in thin canals which increases water flow greatly but these sources contribute to environmental problems
5173887 as a result scientists thought about using coastal tides fence extensions were extended in the canals between small islands and this was an effective measure as opposed to putting these fences along river banks this method proved possible in some areas in the country but it is seasonal and relies heavily on rain and rising water levels which does not make it very useful
5173888 there have been studies conducted about using heat from the earths core it has been discovered that 99 of the earths mass is a heat source that reaches over 1000 c thus making it possible to cover world energy needs for the next 100 thousand years the only problem is converting such energy into electrical power demands very high costs studies are still continuing to ensure the success of this project
5173889 the price of diesel at dubais pumps will come down to dh17 25 a gallon from dh17 75 a gallon from midnight
5173890 despite these positive financial results we are just at the start of an important phase of rapid growth
5173891 this year is of great significance to dana gas as we build on a healthy financial position with the start up soon of our major projects in both the uae and northern iraq which will provide a major boost in propelling dana gas to the next level and add significant value to our shareholders
5173892 in our major project in the kurdistan region of iraq the construction of the 180 kilometre pipeline and the first phase processing facilities have now been completed and is in the process of testing and commissioning in preparation for first gas production in the coming few weeks
5173893 we asked what their biggest need was and they told us food
5173894 she looked at them and she pointed at me and she said
5173895 and i think she really thought i was going to take her home
5173896 its our job to take the senators message the overall plan and determine how to best apply that to our states
5173897 on a day to day basis we are not only identifying opportunities with voters but we are also building a comprehensive overall plan that works across all departments whether its political communications fundraising or the e campaign
5173898 it is a balance between motivating and mobilizing the strong republican areas but also reaching out to independents democrats and undecideds in the more battleground counties
5173899 shell see theres not a lot of grassroots enthusiasm right now among social conservatives in michigan for mccain
5173900 you dont see the kind of passion that makes people write checks put up a yard sign and volunteer to make phone calls
5173901 shes consistently sought out the most difficult political races and consistently excelled at those races
5173902 i got involved because i wanted to make a difference
5173903 it matters who our elected officials are if theres an issue that is the reason i am a republican it would be fiscal issues
5173904 sen mccain did over 100 town halls in new hampshire and went voter to voter and absolutely earned that victory
5173905 through smart messaging i saw first hand that mccains campaign was a freight train
5173906 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5173907 i believe it is very important for the transportation security administration to fully examine these allegations
5173908 the isolated actions of a very few over the course of many years
5173909 the federal air marshal service maintains a policy of zero tolerance of retaliation in the workplace against an employee for raising a concern or complaint through any established formal or informal process
5173910 for years tsa has been telling its employees there is a zero tolerance policy against whistleblower retaliation but for the past four years i have received nonstop retaliation for my whistleblower disclosures
5173911 unfortunately we are once again largely back to where we started
5173912 since the 1994 amendments 177 whistleblower cases have come before the federal circuit court however
5173913 hopefully the house and senate will roll up their sleeves and iron out their differences to get a final bill

5173915 the first version of the atc software should be deployed for the dubai test track in august 2008

5173917 when i heard she had died i just couldnt take it in
5173918 i just couldnt believe it it just couldnt have been true
5173919 people were all too happy to help the campaign and we received lots of supportive words
5173920 if all this saves the life of just one other persons child its all been worth it they wont have to go through what weve been through
5173921 the driver who killed rachel ward cannot be punished again but it gives the courts the chance to imprison people where death is caused by careless driving
5173922 the wards were denied justice but their campaign means that other families can get justice in the future
5173923 where carelessness causes a death it is right that the driver should face tough penalties
5173924 rachel was a very similar person to me if she wanted something she would work and work at it and see it through to the end

5173956 accusations against scientologist are just that accusations they have no basis in fact
5173957 sinhalese and tamil alike have found that scientologists are good people our respect for other religions especially buddhism and people of faith is genuine and evidenced by our actions
5173958 unfortunately asia is still divided according to the lines of religions languages and according to so many other idiotic factors
5173959 i appeal to you that after your armed forces leave georgian territory to start serious thinking and discussions about further negotiations a further search for ways to conduct relations in order not to sow discord between our countries for good

5173969 that so many of us are collectors at heart as well makes me believe that its another predisposition of our species we like to keep we like to hoard collectibles can serve as trophies for some a symbol of a successful and fulfilling hunt an adobe acrobat pdf file on ones pc desktop just doesnt fill that same need
5173970 ive been having an uneasy relationship with the world of comics over the last few years its a world i had never intended to engage with i had always wanted to be an artist of a serious sort offering my observations and commentary on life as it is lived in our times an author sought out for his wisdom and insight how i came to get mixed up with this subculture of the fantastical i cannot now recall the medium of the cartoon strip has been inexorably drawn into its vortex though i have protested the trend at every turn

5174009 the reality is that today the mac platform is relatively safe there are hundreds of thousands of viruses and other malicious software programs floating around for windows but less than 200 are known to target the mac and many of those are aimed at versions of the mac os prior to mac os x and thus have no effect on a modern mac its not that mac os x is inherently more secure against viruses than current versions of windows although it was clearly more secure than windows prior to xp sp2 the numerous vulnerabilities reported and patched in recent years are just as exploitable as their windows equivalents but most security experts agree that malicious software these days is driven by financial incentives and its far more profitable to target the most dominant platform

5174029 5 tips for creating hr policies that will hold up in court
5174030 there may be perfectly good reasons for treating employees who seem similarly situated differently and you need to consider these differences in advance
5174031 sometimes the problem with a termination is that there are few documents supporting your decision
5174032 there is nothing wrong with creating such documents in fact it is a good idea
5174033 the worst thing to do when terminating an employee is to be dishonest as to why yet this is a common mistake
5174034 but most discrimination allegations turn not on direct evidence like racial slurs but on pretext
5174035 an employer gives a false reason for termination creating the inference that the real reason was unlawful
5174036 cold heartedness does not play well before a judge and especially a jury
5174037 it may be a great investment to pay a few weeks of severance for absolution from litigation

5174044 glimpses of the fiction and reality that bollywood dreams are made of
5174045 when i met the other partners the idea of getting all designers under one roof seemed like a fabulous idea and we went ahead with it
5174046 have always fascinated indians the store will offer clothes inspired by bollywood and some of the biggest names in todays fashion including neeta lulla aki narula and rohit bal will come under one roof this will also give a platform to bollywood stars with creativity
5174047 the most used products lipsticks lotions and foundations have mineral oil petroleum formalin and many other toxic elements
5174048 also follow the warnings as prescribed on the product the stress should be on items that are sure of their effects after patch test
5174049 a footwear designer is responsible for conceptualising the design and pattern of the product in todays market there is a great demand for designer footwear and thus an increasing demand for footwear designers in the industry
5174050 footwear should be very comfortable and needs to fit properly therefore precision of work is inevitable
5174051 a good design which is not comfortable to wear adds on to the negative points of a good designer
5174052 to create new designs and patterns it is not only important to keep track of the latest trends but also to see creations by wellknown designers from all over the world
5174053 there are no specific pre requirements needed to study footwear designing however a creative mind and some basic knowledge of drawing will make it easier and faster for a student to learn

5174057 i am sorry i am not attracted to you not specifically because you are fat feminine but because i simply think that we are not compatible

5174072 even if the fda is doing the best it can it simply cant see the future clearly enough to pre empt manufacturers from litigation the court system represents one of the key defense mechanisms that individuals have if a manufacturer has not made the risks of a product clear to the public
5174073 the fda alone simply lacks the ability to serve as the sole guarantor of drug safety
5174074 the fda would be stripped of an essential source of information that the agency has consistently relied on when making its regulatory decisions and the american public would be deprived of a vital deterrent against pharmaceutical company misconduct

5174076 we can infer from the record that comm davis understood her duties as port commissioner and the legal necessity of voting in public session before potentially obligating the port in any monetary agreement and for purposes of recall intentionally acted outside the scope of these duties by signing an agreement with dinsmore
5174077 if we did not have her daviss knowledge about how things did not work in a transparent and open way in the past we would not have been able to make many of the most important revisions to the delegation of authority

5174101 the party gets so popular that no one wants to go to it anymore
5174102 whatever your dreams are try to stay open to new ideas be willing to listen because new ideas can come from anywhere sometimes theyre the ones that get chucked over the wall our job is to make sure the walls that we create are not so high that the new ideas can no longer reach us
5174103 whatever your organisation attempts to achieve from both its philanthropic endeavours and its commercial aspirations avoid those who try to be negative and cynical because that way of thinking takes no effort at all and must be a rather unsatisfying way to go through life i realise of course that in the end having a positive attitude may not solve all your problems but it just may annoy enough people along the way to make the effort worthwhile
5174104 start up is a way of thinking a mindset rather than a stage of your company the founder of qualcomm and one of the most outstanding entrepreneurs of all time irwin jacobs has said of qualcomm which is a multi billion dollar company of course were a start up were just a start up with really big cashflow being a start up is a state of mind its about constant growth in a creative destruction type of way

5174115 we connected the dots to draw a critical conclusion and found evidence over the amazon that traces the direct path of the effect of human activity on climate change by way of human caused aerosols
5174116 during the dry season in the amazon the only aerosols of any magnitude are from smoke emerging from human initiated fires
5174117 scientists have observed instances where increases or decreases in the amount of these tiny particles have increased and decreased cloud cover in different places and times
5174118 we saw an example of this ourselves increased aerosols over the amazon produced less cloud cover over the atlantic ocean however increased aerosols actually produced more cloud cover we wanted to know what the link was between these different outcomes from varying amounts and types of aerosols this paper gives us a clear picture of what is occurring
5174119 this result helps us understand aerosols effect on a clouds mass and lifetime how long it will provide cloud cover how deep the clouds will be and when and where it will rain
5174120 this improved understanding leads to prediction and prediction can help us plan and perhaps prevent some of the potential consequences of putting aerosols from human activity into the atmosphere
5174121 as wed expected in applying our model increased smoke from the fires created clouds rife with a more pronounced radiative effect rich with human caused aerosols that absorbed sunlight warmed the local atmosphere and blocked evaporation this led to reduced cloud cover over the amazon
5174122 and its encouraging to know the science behind our model should stand no matter the region
5174123 progress and prospects on water for a clean and healthy world
5174124 its not very popular to talk about toilets and excrement and where to go when you are menstruating this is something that makes people feel uncomfortable
5174125 five thousand children die every day of diarrhoea because of a lack of hygiene and sanitation and nobody really cares
5174126 we have to understand that what we eat and the products we buy have an immediate implication for the availability of the worlds water resources
5174127 surprisingly 20 million europeans need access to safe and affordable sanitation
5174128 now weve stopped discussing whether or not there has been climate change or where or who has been contributing to it
5174129 now its all about its there and we have to live with it and the question is okay what to do how to adapt
5174130 we hope our installations will bring about a net cooling of the area and if the melt is not stopped that it is at least slowed
5174131 is that big brains enhance the rate of evolutionary diversification by facilitating changes in behavior which would place new selection pressures on populations and favor adaptive divergence
5174132 nonetheless we are paying a lot of attention to the situation
5174133 the amount of water advancing toward the south is going to make the water level rise in the centre and the south
5174134 every termite will emit co2 from their gut because when they consume the wood and digest it they get wind
5174135 with every degree the global temperature rises the life cycle of each bug will be shorter the quicker the life cycle the higher the population of pests
5174136 each cockroach produces 600 babies in their lifetime and we have more than 100 entrants so our success to date is that we are reducing 60 000 cockroaches without using any chemicals at all and thats the beauty of it
5174137 the termite queen is like an egg laying machine so with every queen we get rid of 100 000 termites immediately
5174138 we went out with the soldiers and a lot of them helped us because we know them
5174139 i didnt think we had a winner because a lot of people brought big ones and there were many almost as big as this one
5174140 the prize money is fine but we spent quite a lot of money to get it
5174141 every termite will emit co2 from their gut because when they consume the wood and digest it they get wind
5174142 with every degree the global temperature rises the life cycle of each bug will be shorter the quicker the life cycle the higher the population of pests
5174143 we know very well well not be about to win the war against insects they have been here much longer than us cockroaches were here 350 million years ago
5174144 we used to live plain and simple a wall was a simple brick wall but now we have decorated walls that insects hide behind
5174145 i applied for a job in the late 1960s and was given a choice between marketing and what my poor english thought was
5174146 the biggest problem has been personal hygiene which is far below standards
5174147 many of these people have been confined to camps for years
5174148 festivals like this are a great opportunity for amateur film makers like myself to have our films screened to a wide audience
5174149 the film really shows whats at stake for this magnificent creature
5174150 it the project aims to create a stable security environment for free and transparent elections by re introducing ex fighters socially and economically back into their old communities
5174151 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5174152 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
5174153 the negative and positive implications of wastewater agriculture have only recently received attention
5174154 this study offers the first comprehensive cross country analysis of the conditions that account for the practice and the difficult tradeoffs that arise from it
5174155 of the large potential of wastewater agriculture for both helping and hurting great numbers of urban consumers
5174156 and it isnt just affluent consumers of exotic vegetables whose welfare is at stake
5174157 poor consumers of inexpensive street food also depend on urban agriculture
5174158 a key aim of iwmi research is to find feasible approaches whereby wastewater irrigation can continue strengthening food security and generating economic benefits but without major health risks for urban consumers and farmers
5174159 the top issue at the sydney summit is data security
5174160 it is a necessary part of a security program and is big because it reveals the limitations of a purely technological approach to security
5174161 there hasnt been that much data loss happening here but being a security person i assume that these terrible things are happening but nobody talks about them
5174162 its become a big phrase but weve been talking about computing in the cloud for 15 years
5174163 theres still a big debate about what it exactly means i tend to want to specify aspects of cloud computing for example software as a service is an example of a cloud computing
5174164 s lo una m nima parte de los miles de maestros interinos en el pa s se sum a este acto de simulaci n en el que ni siquiera se reconocieron las demandas m nimas para la cobertura de plazas docentes destinadas a egresados del normalismo p blico por entidad

5174166 no es casualidad que en baja california sur guerrero coahuila distrito federal puebla tamaulipas tlaxacala y zacatecas el porcentaje de aspirantes fuera mucho menor de lo esperado pues se han convertido en focos rojos del rechazo tanto a la ley del issste como a la aplicaci n de la llamada alianza por la calidad de la educaci n
5174167 se ha convertido en un riesgo porque ense a a formar ciudadanos democr ticos y honestos como debe ser la educaci n y no como ahora se pretende imponer con la alianza para que en el aula se forje mano de obra barata eficientes como obreros pero nulificados como ciudadanos

5174170 you have shown great kindness to your servant my father david because he was faithful to you and righteous and upright in heart you have continued this great kindness to him and have given him a son to sit on his throne this very day lord my god you have made your servant king in place of my father david but i am only a little child and do not know how to carry out my duties 8 your servant is here among the people you have chosen a great people too numerous to count or number 9 so give your servant a discerning heart to govern your people and to distinguish between right and wrong for who is able to govern this great people of yours
5174171 since you have asked for this and not for long life or wealth for yourself nor have asked for the death of your enemies but for discernment in administering justice 12 i will do what you have asked i will give you a wise and discerning heart so that there will never have been anyone like you nor will there ever be 13 moreover i will give you what you have not asked for both riches and honor so that in your lifetime you will have no equal among kings 14 and if you walk in my ways and obey my statutes and commands as david your father did i will give you a long life
5174172 my lord this woman and i live in the same house i had a baby while she was there with me
5174173 during the night this womans son died because she lay on him 20 so she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while i your servant was asleep she put him by her breast and put her dead son by my breast 21 the next morning i got up to nurse my son and he was dead but when i looked at him closely in the morning light i saw that it wasnt the son i had borne
5174174 no the living one is my son the dead one is yours
5174175 this one says my son is alive and your son is dead while that one says no
5174176 cut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other
5174177 please my lord give her the living baby dont kill him
5174178 neither i nor you shall have him cut him in two
5174179 give the living baby to the first woman do not kill him she is his mother
5174180 est bien hablarle a la gente de esperanza y de cambio pero es necesario ofrecer ideas m s concretas y pragm ticas
5174181 en lugar de tantos discursos en grandes estadios tiene que dar respuestas breves a la gente sencilla sobre c mo mejorar sus vidas
5174182 todos deber an tranquilizarse un poco y recordar que mucha gente no toma su decisi n hasta bien metidos en agosto

5174185 i dont know i always get scared that somethings going to rip through the screen and get into the room and ill be the first victim
5174186 this is why i dont sleep with my window open
5174187 to live with the conscious knowledge of the shadow of uncertainty with the knowledge that disaster or tragedy could strike at any time to be afraid and to know and acknowledge your fear and still to live creatively and with unstinting love that is to live with grace
5174188 well be working hand in hand with our neighbors on many common interests
5174189 by working together and sharing our knowledge we can address medical and engineering concerns common to the region while also demonstrating our commitment to developing cooperative solutions and fostering lasting bonds of friendship
5174190 the cooperation between the different nations non governmental organizations and host nation citizens in this mission will benefit us greatly
5174191 should a disaster ever strike this area we will be able to build upon the care clinical information and cooperation were working on now
5174192 by working alongside our partners here making renovations and repairs and building a better relationship with the nation we will establish a great bond between our two nations
5174193 we are very proud to be a part of this mission and focused on not only helping our neighbors but also learning from them
5174194 my clients wish that they hadnt had to bring this lawsuit they would have greatly preferred to be working inside the justice department where by all rights they deserved to be defending the government in court rather than standing as victimized examples of government wrongdoing
5174195 reveal defendant department of justices utterly unredeemable obliviousness to its legal obligations and its remarkably recidivistic failures to meet them in the first place
5174196 this was an extraordinary and uniquely successful conspiracy to achieve political results that required the gross deprivation of hundreds of individuals constitutional rights for which defendant gonzales was legally most responsible
5174197 we have no idea why the six plaintiffs in this case were not selected for the departments extraordinarily competitive honors program and summer law intern programs except that it had nothing to do with monica goodling a fact that the evidence will bear out in court
5174198 in times like these how do i differentiate my resume so that my resume gets shortlisted and provides me an interview opportunity
5174199 you need to demonstrate throughout on your resume your application and in your communications with a targeted employer that you have delivered results on the problem the employer is facing
5174200 there are not a lot of people who can leave their thumbprint on a business those individuals are the top 10 percent of the talent pool they are the people that businesses will always look to hire no matter what the market or economy

5174213 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5174214 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5174215 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5174216 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5174217 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5174218 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5174219 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5174222 he gave great hugs it felt like he never wanted to let go
5174223 just accept how you feel and dive with that feeling
5174224 naturally i was more emotional then ive been in the past but i think thats understandable
5174225 as an athlete the transition can be tough but its exciting too
5174226 i said to myself this is not good snap out of it
5174227 on my second dive i said youve got to do something to change this and then i did im very proud that i was able to acknowledge how i felt not try to fight it and make a change during the competition
5174228 the other girls they just beat her fair and square said geller while adding hed never been more impressed with hartley than he was last night both as diver and vulnerable human being
5174229 she struggled in the semis in all likelihood this will be her last event and shes trying to do her brother proud
5174230 the pace picked up a little bit and i got bumped at one point and i just didnt do a very good job of recovering my position
5174231 i had gotten myself into decent position early in the race and the third lap was really what cost me i just left myself too much room going into that last lap
5174232 i told myself at the beginning of the year i wasnt going to think or talk retirement or have it enter my mind until this is over
5174233 ive still got the possibility of racing in the 5 000 metres so im not quite ready to think about it quite yet
5174234 i kicked with the best guys in the world in the heat
5174235 im not afraid to go to the front with the best in the world
5174236 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5174237 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5174238 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5174239 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5174240 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment and they do have profound differences of opinion on the best way to reduce our dependence on mideast oil bring jobs back to america and keep our nation safe
5174241 respectfully im going to disagree with you on mccain and his service

5174251 censorship like charity should begin at home but unlike charity it should end there
5174252 it is clear that censorship is not a cut and dried issue there is a danger in thinking it is for then the debate falters and understanding ends we must realize that censorship will be with us always it is a weapon to protect the order of society and the peace of communities however it is a two edged sword and must be handled with care and caution of all professions librarianship must ensure that both sides of the debate remain alive if the censorship side predominates truth and moral progress suffer if the anti censorship side predominates the drift to selfishness and anarchy presents a clear danger to the cohesion and order of the social system the destruction of which brings us to barbarism tyranny and the loss of all freedom
5174253 when a librarian really believes that a book is harmful that its content is contrary to the welfare of the community or that it is destructive of good taste even if those are his opinions only he has not only the right but also the obligation to do what he properly can to keep that book out of the hand of those whom he thinks might be injured by it
5174254 mary kay is one of the secret masters of the world a librarian they control information dont ever piss one off
5174255 there was one place where i forgot the cold indeed forgot siberia that was in the library there in that muddy village was a great institution not physically to be sure but in every other way imaginable it was a small log cabin immaculately attended to with loving care it was well lighted with oil lamps and it was warm but best of all it contained a small but amazing collection from the worlds best literature truly amazing considering the time the place and its size from floor to ceiling it was lined with books books books books it was there that i was to become acquainted with the works of dumas pasternaks translations of shakespeare the novels of mark twain jack london and of course the russians it was in that log cabin that i escaped from siberia either reading there or taking the books home it was between that library and two extraordinary teachers that i developed a lifelong passion for the great russian novelists and poets it was there that i learned to line up patiently for my turn to sit at a table and read to wait sometimes months for a book it was there that i learned that reading was not only a great delight but a privilege
5174256 confirmed that mccain did not hear or see any of the broadcast
5174257 we were in motorcade until 5 30 p m et then a holding room in another building with no tv

5174260 mi piacerebbe sapere a che punto stanno con la stoffa
5174261 nessuno meglio di lui potr vedere che aspetto ha quella stoffa perch intelligente e nessuno pi di lui allaltezza del proprio compito
5174262 ma allora sono uno stupido non lavrei mai detto ma meglio che nessun altro lo sappia o magari non sono degno della mia carica di ministro no in tutti casi non posso far sapere che non riesco a vedere la stoffa
5174263 che disegni che colori mi piacciono moltissimo e lo dir allimperatore
5174264 forse che non sono allaltezza della mia carica davvero strano meglio che nessuno se ne accorga
5174265 non vedo proprio nulla terribile che io sia stupido o magari non sono degno di fare limperatore questo il peggio che mi potesse capitare
5174266 ecco qui i pantaloni ecco la giacchetta ecco la mantellina
5174267 che stoffa leggera come una tela di ragno sembra quasi di non avere indosso nulla ma questo appunto il suo pregio
5174268 come sta bene questi vestiti lo fanno sembrare pi bello

5174277 its quite a big fire those living in homes closest to it are getting moved out as a precautionary measure but we have no reports of casualties muirhouse parkway pennywell road and west granton road are all closed at the moment

5174281 he loved his job he loved the people that he worked with
5174282 id describe my style at burning man as basic hippie with a splash of clown
5174283 i like to say the burner boutiques motto is we do virgins
5174284 i can say its 110 percent not patriotic and red white and blue
5174285 i think if people go to places like michaels and craft stores and put their heart into it they will come up with something great
5174286 i think some of the outfits are outrageous but they are things you can translate into street wear
5174287 we leave no trace when we leave burning man so you dont want parts of your costume blowing away
5174288 the 9 increase in the ceiling price approved by the government in 2006 had only partly offset the 40 increase in costs suffered by the industry over the past few years
5174289 coal transportation cement paper bags and other materials have all gone up in price
5174290 were talking about a house payment a car payment you get used to living a certain way and then its pulled out from under you
5174291 we regret the impact this decision has on these employees we had hoped to avoid such a shutdown and believe that it is temporary in nature
5174292 the facility will remain open for business and product will continue to be shipped from its yard there are no plans to permanently close the facility
5174293 theyre telling everybody theyre going to a skeleton crew and the plant is not going to close but theres no way from the way it looks to me theyre not going to be doing much production if any
5174294 he couldve been looking for another job this whole time
5174295 has gone to hell because of the way management and the company has done people they could have at least said a month or two ago start looking we all see whats happening to the economy
5174296 hanson communicates a layoff notice as quickly as market conditions will permit
5174297 when the sanderson plant resumes operations impacted employees will be given the opportunity to exercise their recall rights
5174298 hanson will be proactive and contact employees when this occurs during the layoff period hanson is coordinating with the local unemployment agency to provide benefits for eligible employees

5174302 if its lacking any information we will ask the applicant to submit that information
5174303 well review their calculations and review their modeling to determine whether we agree with them or not
5174304 and if those health based standards are exceeded we will not issue the permit
5174305 i feel it most when we eat together because the food on the table is not enough
5174306 so i decided to have ligation because life is hard
5174307 the lack of an unambiguous population policy reflects a lack of seriousness in promoting long term economic growth and poverty reduction
5174308 our studies show that if the philippines had followed the population growth trajectory of thailand between 1975 and 2000 the per capita income would have been at least 22 percent higher and there would have been 5 million less poor people
5174309 the catholic church knows how to mobilize its members not to vote for anti life politicians

5174326 i carried my nephew in my arms to the hospital he was alive until we reached the hospital and his blood stained my clothes
5174327 what happened is what we feared would happen because this area was the stronghold of al qaeda in adhamiya we killed them we captured them we destroyed them and we expected they would seek revenge
5174328 it appears that on present form the iraqi government probably wont proceed with most of these or all of them

5174335 hmph besides acting like a robot and saying fight for the nations honor besides calling me uncle what else has she said thats true could it be that she isnt really home sick and doesnt miss her mum and dad in ernest should the nation be responsible for their development or should these tiny shoulders hold the weight of responsibility for the nation they are still underage they should be sent back home and back to school
5174336 demon training in our nation began in 1963 in 1964 the national sports committee passed an order to work towards the demon training method adopted by japanese coach daimatsu hirobumi for so many years this is what we have done
5174337 a generals reputation is built upon the sacrifices of tens of thousands of soldiers
5174338 the fullerton city council has been trying to secretly negotiate a 25 percent pension spike for government employees in closed session
5174339 the fix was in behind closed doors for a 25 percent pension increase
5174340 these benefit hikes are irresponsible and especially unconscionable in a troubled economy the retroactive portion of the pension spike is especially troubling and could be construed as a gift of public funds

5174342 that was the most intense race ive done for so long
5174343 we made a bit of a mistake at the beginning
5174344 every other boat who had a medal chance wanted to cover us but then we did a good run and took a couple of boats
5174345 at one point we thought wed lost it three races ago we looked like we had no chance of a medal
5174346 we had our backs against the wall silver was the best we could do and that was hard to take im really pleased we turned it around
5174347 in athens we were going in with a chance to win gold and we didnt
5174348 while the past six weeks have been incredibly difficult and they have been incredibly frustrating watching this entire saga play out in the public i can honestly say i am absolutely relieved now that there is clarity going forward and i now know what i am up against
5174349 while i am shocked and also saddened that it has got this far in terms of all the allegations and the charges i am more determined than ever to fight to clear my name
5174350 i now look forward to every chance and every possibility for all information and all of the facts to be played out in the appropriate forum
5174351 there are two sides to every story and i guarantee that both will come out in the end
5174352 if thats what hes saying then i suspect that he was looking for an excuse it was not new zealands intention to provide him with an excuse not to come which is why i agreed that he should be able to transit through auckland airport
5174353 i think it speaks volumes if they are not prepared to come and be accountable to forum leaders but obviously we are going to await formal advice as to whether they are coming or not
5174354 sometimes something like that happening can change the internal dynamic at home
5174355 my assessment is that leaders feel that the events in fiji are really casting a stain on the pacific the leaders want to be seen and have the forum be seen to continue to be leading international opinion and action on the issue
5174356 so its going to be taken very seriously whether or not the commodore is there
5174357 if a rather tenuous interim government sees interim ministers resigning from it yes i would have thought it would further destabilise the situation in fiji
5174358 it took a little while before i realised that i dont have an intelligent radio
5174359 i hope he takes this new version of the prisoner as a compliment rather than a challenge to his great achievement

5174362 president musharraf is not going to saudi arabia or any other country and he will fight impeachment constitutionally
5174363 he is most likely going to resign he may get safe passage hes been trying to get safe passage for the past two months
5174364 this is an issue that is not on the table
5174365 he kept to his word he took off the uniform theres now a democratic government in pakistan
5174366 thats something we currently dont require that restaurants do but its something that has been discussed
5174367 citizens are asking for more and more information about their food and i do believe that as we go forward whatever we have done in the past will not be sufficient
5174368 after the report the county board of supervisors decided it was really time to make substantial changes and doing this was an absolute no brainer
5174369 we wanted the restaurants to have the same incentives we did which is to protect the public and by giving grades and requiring them to display them we aligned those incentives
5174370 safer food facilities reduced incidents of foodborne illness improved information for consumers and enthusiastic support for the grading program
5174371 honestly if we had more dollars to invest i would much prefer that we use them to further the recognition of performing restaurants were using the carrot rather than the stick
5174372 if i walk into a restaurant and dont see the proof that theyre performing they must not be making it
5174373 in a sense our grading system is very similar to what the study recommended
5174374 the committee just thought that the grades we adopted would be more relevant because there is so much context to those letter grades from schools and it was too stigmatizing and inflammatory
5174375 in pittsburgh and washington d c we had to file freedom of information act requests and wait several months to get the reports
5174376 and baltimore only sent 14 of the 30 reports we requested they said they just werent staffed well enough to have the reports sorted in any meaningful way
5174377 in cities where they dont require the posting of grade cards consumers arent really aware of anything short of the closure of the restaurant for health reasons so its kind of the restaurateurs hidden shame
5174378 they can kind of say well maybe well do better next time and maybe we wont i dont think that should be a hidden shame
5174379 we had some challenges but you have to meet the challenges you cant use an old building as an excuse
5174380 for me its something that would be good to have up there for the customer and the employees for the employees that grade is going to be a constant reminder of where they are good or bad and what they need to do
5174381 im in favor of putting it right there in front where everybody can see it
5174382 i lived in l a and i saw how they did things when they decided to clean it up they didnt mess around they closed about 30 restaurants in about 30 days
5174383 we have ethics training we do statistical analysis of inspections to look at things we rotate inspection assignments and areas we also have unannounced inspections by supervisors the day after our inspectors go out
5174384 you can take that to mean that you have the cleanest restaurants or you can take that to mean that you have the most lenient inspectors
5174385 the sample size was small and for the most part the restaurants they chose to study here were ones that had pretty good control systems in place
5174386 he is a wise man he is a very experienced man and he has seen the writing on the wall
5174387 he has seen the sentiments of not just the elected representatives but various institutions who all asked him to move in a particular way and do not destabilise things here

5174390 free pearls or things ive learned in life without really trying
5174391 im really happy to win my first stage race said keller
5174392 it was a really nice race and i found out what it feels like to be a gc rider i didnt have to do anything after i got the yellow jersey except eat and drink my team mates did everything else
5174393 the girls rode really well together and came up with a very exciting victory
5174394 it was also very rewarding for me as this is my first tour win as a director in womens cycling
5174395 the final round of the individual pursuit was really controlled basicaly i was just trying not to go in too deep
5174396 ive got really strong team mates around me this isnt a one man band after all
5174397 the course was really fast and a touch windy there wasnt much time for thinking i just knew i had to go for broke
5174398 this has been such a team effort from the staff and management down to the riders that i just wanted to do what i could to repay everyone for all the hard work that they put in
5174399 reporters were asking me more about brent and i couldnt say enough good things about him until i realized he beat me today
5174400 actually brent is so impressive and has come so far since breaking his leg last year if this tour had lasted a few more days it very well could have been brent taking the overall
5174401 i definitely lost some time today since i punctured and ended up riding the last half of the course on a flat tire
5174402 but the course really was suited to larger riders and both brent and jeff still rode well enough to move up on the gc its a great day for the team
5174403 ive been knocking on the door for a big victory for a while now but i just didnt know when it would happen
5174404 it is a dream come true personally for me to win my home tour but in the larger picture what were seeing is a real evolution of this team and a culmination of all the hard work and dedication
5174405 garmin worked very hard and rode a great race all week
5174406 they had to defend from stage 1 caldwell is a very complete rider so im sure we will be having more trouble with him in the future
5174407 having my little girl with me on the podium after stage 4 was very special for me even if it didnt really mean much to her
5174408 but i really have to thank my wife for her support and the support that all my friends and family being here gave me i was really able to work off their energy too
5174409 si esta cl usula del acuerdo de alto el fuego no se aplicase r pida y totalmente tendr a que convocar un consejo europeo extraordinario para decidir sobre las consecuencias a sacar

5174414 horrible the lies of the chinese government need to be exposed and the west needs to step up the pressure dont sweep this under the rug
5174415 the tibetan center for human rights and democracy is of course completely unbiased and would never lie to us
5174416 both sides are obviously equally capable of distorting the truth and publishing false numbers
5174417 however the hard fact is that the unrest was started by groups of tibetans and that their protest was not peaceful was is the chinese government being overly harsh in trying to stop the riots maybe but get it through your head that this isnt a simple case of evil communists violently suppressing innocent tibetans for no reason
5174418 it is very hard to find out actually how many people died but we think it is logical to assume at least 30 people have died
5174419 tony if the chinese told you that they landed on the moon first i guess you would believe them too
5174420 talk to westeners about the crimes of the chinese government
5174421 china will have to give in to democracy or fall
5174422 all you others who dont agree with me are wimps spies or retarded
5174423 did you hear that american blacks are shouting god dxxn america in their sunday sermon
5174424 god damn america for treating our citizens as less than human
5174425 the highest form of freedom is the freedom of thoughts and ideas
5174426 just look at this thread a few possibly fake pictures can incite all this discussion now we know how western media works entertainment and sensation seeking
5174427 from my experience in china the government here is no better or worse than the us government or any other governments around the world most chinese i met are pretty happier with their leaders government than a westerner would think
5174428 its really funny that you mentioned your media should be granted free access to these regions let me ask you arent they report for a purpose since when did you see your media report china without a dyed glasses
5174429 the only resolution would be for them to somehow gain their freedom
5174430 if mccain wins you guys are going to stay in iraq as long as it takes maybe your grandchildren will see the light in the end of the tunnel
5174431 as horrible as this is i still find it hard to call china anything in light of whats happening in iraq weve killed over 1 million innocent civilians there in the name of democracy can we really point fingers about human rights violations
5174432 its clear that the chinese government isnt wanted by the tibetans
5174433 and that in itself is a justification for demanding chinese withdrawal and for protestation yes perhaps even violent protestation against chinese rule which is obviously rule by oppression rule by the sword
5174434 trimondi yes it is astonishing why the jewish community is so uncritical vis vis the dalai lama on 09 04 03 the swiss newspaper neue z rcher zeitung reported that the tibetan religious leader said on a journey in jerusalem
5174435 we didnt invade any country tibet was is and always shall be part of china tibet issue is our domestic issues
5174436 dalai lama should die in hell he is the real evil for both chinese and tibetans
5174437 when are people going to learn that guns and bombs are not the fucking answer
5174438 mao killed more people than hitler and they still glorify this arsehole
5174439 some chinese pr people from their paramoiuntleader terror regime are trying to flood the forums and blogentries with false information
5174440 i am from europe so this thing here has nothing to do with
5174441 i bet you would have full support from the rest of the free world
5174442 this is not a war this is farmer vs chinese murder militairy they still practicing force abortions on tibetian women to reduce the native population they still torture kids and even monks
5174443 i do feel reel sorry for all of the people in tibet not at all sorry for any of the chinese they actually have a big enough population to over throw their government they just dont realize it
5174444 all ethnic groups within the boundaries of the peoples republic of china are equal they establish unity and mutual aid among themselves and shall oppose imperialism and public enemies in their midst so that the peoples republic of china will become a big fraternal and cooperative family comprising all its ethnic groups greater nationalism and local nationalism should be opposed acts of discrimination oppression and dividing the various nationalities should be prohibited
5174445 regional autonomy should be exercised in areas where ethnic minorities are concentrated all ethnic minorities should have the freedom to develop their spoken and written languages and to preserve or reform their traditions customs and religious beliefs the peoples government shall assist the broad masses of all ethnic minorities to develop politically economically culturally and educationally
5174446 shameless news media cnn refused to correct the biased reports and photoshopped pictures
5174447 we condone the brutality and oppression of the chinese communist dictatorship
5174448 we condone the brutality and oppression of the chinese communist dictatorship
5174449 and upon what meat doth senator mccarthy feed two of the staples of his diet are the investigation protected by immunity and the half truth
5174450 it is the corruption of truth the abandonment of the due process law it is the use of the big lie and the unfounded accusation against any citizen in the name of americanism or security it is the rise to power of the demagogue who lives on untruth it is the spreading of fear and the destruction of faith in every level of society
5174451 to be persuasive we must be believable to be believable we must be credible to be credible we must be truthful
5174452 chinas government is cracking down tibetan protestors who took the streets to protest chinese rule of the province
5174453 we like everyone in this business are going to be judged by what we put on the air but we also shall be judged by what we dont broadcast if we pull back on this well have it with us always
5174454 the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves
5174455 we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home
5174456 we have lost all moral authority to speak on behalf of human rights anywhere in the world
5174457 they are worried about a larger number of things and they are worried about keeping the lid on
5174458 demonstrations of all kinds are a concern including anti american demonstrations said the consultant who works for beijings olympic organizers and asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to talk to the media
5174459 psyops personnel soldiers and officers have been working in cnns headquarters in atlanta through our program training with industry
5174460 they worked as regular employees of cnn conceivably they would have worked on stories during the kosovo war they helped in the production of news
5174461 to get to know the company and to broaden their horizons
5174462 i dont believe that we would employ military personnel it doesnt seem like something we would normally do
5174463 these are not legitimate tribal governments elected by the people
5174464 when they begin the process of violating other peoples rights breaking the law theyre going to end up like all the other groups that have declared themselves independent usually getting arrested and being put in jail
5174465 they are basically the same bunch of goons and thugs as they were in the past 50 years
5174466 coordinate the work of the international tibet groups and consolidate the links between them with the central tibetan government in exile
5174467 we are determined to have non violent direct action in the heart of beijing inside the games every day
5174468 eventually they got him on the ground they were hitting him on the head with stones until he lost consciousness i believe that young man was killed
5174469 return to china or if they would like to remain be treated as foreigners
5174470 they will in any case not be allowed to participate in the political life

5174490 cognitive behavior therapy and psychoanalysis in treating and managing depression
5174491 it is a truth universally acknowledged that when one area of your life starts to go okay another falls spectacularly to pieces
5174492 although conflict has many aspects one that warfighters and policy makers often talk about is the motivation to fight which undoubtedly has its origins in the brain and is reflected in peripheral neurophysiological processes
5174493 so one question would be how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight other questions raised by controlling the mind how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands as cognitive neuroscience and related technologies become more pervasive using technology for nefarious purposes becomes easier

5174497 rick did an amazing job of asking the questions most of us would ask the candidates if we could
5174498 i just really liked how john mccain gave well stated answers he didnt even have to think he takes a stand barack has a charming personality he didnt always give the direct answer
5174499 i think obama did very well and he doesnt need to win a majority of this audience he merely needs to keep mccains support below typical trends but this was mccains best performance in memory for the first time i can think of in 08
5174500 but i also think that its worth noting that but i suspect he may be riding high for a while after tonight
5174501 obama wasnt just bad but that mccain was very good
5174502 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5174503 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5174504 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5174505 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5174506 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5174507 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5174508 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5174509 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5174510 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5174511 you can make these up to one week in advance
5174512 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
5174513 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
5174514 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
5174515 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5174516 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5174517 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5174518 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5174519 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars

5174527 muhammad ini cukup istimewa sehingga aku lebih mengasihinya lebih dari aku mengasihi anak anak kandungku sendiri dalam matanya ada sesuatu yang menyebabkan aku yakin setiap katanya aku segani setiap perbuatannya jiwanya tenang ditengah tengah amukan anak muda dan masyarakat kedatanganku ini untuk bertanya adakah masih perlu pemuda untuk menguruskan perdaganganmu
5174528 wahai khadijah puan memberi gaji 2 bakras kepada si pulan dan si pulan jika muhammad ini diambil bekerja tidak perlulah digajinya sampai 4 bakras

5174532 wahai muhammad pergilah bertemu khadijah terlebih dahulu beritahulah kepadanya apa yang ditakdirkan allah ke atas perniagaannya melalui tangan mulia mu tentu khadijah yang luhur budinya itu akan bersyukur atas perniagaannya dan atas pertemuannya dengan kamu
5174533 andainya engkau mempunyai pilihan mahukah engkau menolak kecantikan kekayaan dan kehormatan
5174534 wahai khadijah apakah yang telah berlaku ke atas diriku ini
5174535 subhanallah demi dia yang menguasai seluruh jiwa waraqah percayailah aku wahai khadijah sesungguhnya yang mendatangi suamimu muhammad itu adalah suatu roh suci yang pernah mendatangi nabi musa a s dahulu muhammad itu nabi kaum ummat ini maka beritahulah kepada muhammad supaya berpegang tegung kepada nya dia akan didustakan dizalimi dengan penuh kejam hatta akan diperangi jika sekiranya aku masih hidup lagi pada waktu tersebut pasti aku akan membantunya perjuangan muhammad s a w
5174536 wahai kekasihku yang paling dikasihi berbaringlah dan rehatlah sesungguhnya tuhan sama sekali tidak mengabaikan kebaikanmu
5174537 tidak wahai khadijah sesungguhnya masa untuk tidur lena telah tiada malaikat jibril a s telah memerintahkan aku supaya memberi peringatan kepada manusia dan menyeru mereka supaya kembali kepada allah tetapi siapakah yang patut aku seru dan siapa pula yang ingin menyahur seruanku itu

5174767 georgia will never give up a square kilometre of its territory
5174768 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia

5174771 try your best to treat others as you would wish to be treated yourself and you will find that this is the shortest way to benevolence
5174772 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5174773 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5174774 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5174775 aqu llos hechos con pescado son llamados aqu llos hechos con carne son llamados
5174776 es una comida donde el pescado es sazonado con arroz y sal y que se come cuando est listo
5174777 there was a definite cockiness that democrats felt once they regained control of congress and ive felt it was a misplaced cockiness
5174778 i dont think you see leads in presidential races over five points in this day and age obama has averaged leads of three points since spring the key is that obama hasnt closed the sale
5174779 la decisi n tomada por el estado es adecuada considerando la negativa por parte de yale para devolver un patrimonio que inclusive la national geographic ha reconocido como peruano
5174780 las mujeres tienen que obedecer a sus maridos y preservar la religi n sa es su misi n

5174785 la venta legal permitir a los furtivos lavar sus partidas ilegales entre otros motivos porque se incrementar la demanda
5174786 china ha demostrado poner en pr ctica leyes y severos controles para impedir el tr fico ilegal que en algunos casos son m s efectivos de los que se llevan a cabo en la uni n europea
5174787 puede dar un vuelco a lo que hasta ahora se cre a sobre los dinosaurios europeos
5174788 aqu hemos encontrado un dromeosaurio y dos titanosaurios nuevos estos ltimos con unas protuberancias seas en la espalda osteodermos que no se les conoc an y un ter podo carn voro un tarascosaurus de casi 10 metros de longitud
5174789 aporta espectacularidad por la enorme cantidad de f siles y mucha informaci n de lo que hace 70 millones de a os pasaba en europa y frica todos conocemos bien los dinosaurios norteamericanos y los asi ticos de mongolia pero muy poco de los de aqu de los titanosaurios hemos descubierto por ejemplo que eran grandes pero muy gr ciles estilizados que ten an una cola larga y que se alimentaban de ramas bajas de los rboles el m s grande que hemos encontrado deb a medir unos 20 metros
5174790 deb a de haber riadas y el canal acumulaba barro con restos de animales que mor an en la cuenca o en sus orillas y stos son los mejor conservados las riadas desbordaban el canal por la llanura y dejaban ah todo el sedimento ha sido una suerte que el ave hiciera necesario abrir el cerro para que lo descubri ramos
5174791 were not as concerned about it as we initially were
5174792 este abono contribuye a mejorar y mantener las condiciones biol gicas de los suelos y aportar nutrientes que necesitan las plantas
5174793 supondr un ahorro econ mico por parte de los usuarios que utilizan esti rcol para abonar sus plantaciones ya que la progresiva reducci n del ganado hace incrementar el precio del abono procedente de los animales
5174794 diese zwei fehlentscheidungen das bergreifen und der strafpunkt haben das spiel entschieden
5174795 ein schiedsrichter ist gut wenn er nicht zu sehen ist aber der hier hat sich zur hauptperson gemacht
5174796 wir haben nicht so gespielt wie es unsere weltranglistenpositionen eigentlich erwarten lassen
5174797 weil sich die beiden selbst zu sehr unter druck gesetzt haben
5174798 immer dieselben gesichter immer die mensa immer das gleiche essen
5174799 no matter how much power government has it never has enough
5174800 the most difficult thing about politics is dealing with people with really bad breath
5174801 never run a 100 yard dash in a 90 yard room
5174802 once you create a bureaucracy it is near to impossible to ever get rid of it
5174803 the folks back home see a washington bureau as a luxury
5174804 they get plenty of copy from the wires to fill up their pages i dont know that theres a real understanding of washington
5174805 ive watched people parachute into washington and they just dont have the same facility
5174806 get embedded in washington just as reporters develop sources at city hall or the school board you go beyond stenography into enterprise
5174807 the coverage obviously suffered after 04 we never went to the white house anymore
5174808 i was crushed i will never look at someone who has lost his job the same way
5174809 if you can get around the jargon we all talk in and make clear why this matters it will be read
5174810 shes taught me lessons about myself and i feel like ive taught her
5174811 weve both changed and grown and we just feel like oh okay this is completion
5174812 bill murray has his feet firmly planted on the ground after a 13 500 foot skydiving jump friday to kick off the 50th chicago air and water show

5174815 ucapan penangguhan presiden diharap dapat memberi kefahaman yang lebih jelas kepada seluruh perwakilan dan pemerhati bagi memastikan mereka tidak keliru lagi
5174816 muktamar ini dikatakan tak boleh dikawal dan berlaku perpecahan hebat seperti mana digambarkan media massa
5174817 sedangkan kita ada rahsia di mana islam mengajar kita untuk berparti atau berjemaah untuk wala kepada pemimpin
5174818 muktamar sebenarnya tempat kita berkhilaf pendapat berbahas dan bertukar pandangan adab inilah kita amalkan dalam muktamar ini ia hedaklah dihafal dan diamal oleh ahli bagi memperkasakan parti
5174819 ianya dibuat tanpa meruntuhkan dasar dan prinsip perbezaan ideologi untuk mengadakan kerjasama selain tidak mencetuskan perkara yang boleh membakar jambatan yang telah dibina
5174820 apa yang penting semua pihak perlu memainkan peranan masing masing bagi memastikan agenda untuk memartabatkan islam serta memberi khidmat kepada rakyat terlaksana
5174821 persediaan pas adalah lebih awal dibuat berbanding yang lain memandangkan usia pas yang lebih awal ditubuhkan
5174822 apa yang saya maksudkan adalah perpaduan yang dibina merentasi sempadan masa tempat bangsa agama dan segalanya ianya lebih bersifat global
5174823 dalam suasana yang hangat dibakar media massa dan bloggers saya lihat sikap perwakilan begitu matang dan profesional
5174824 ini amat menggembirakan saya selain teguran dan cadangan yang diberikan secara bernas
5174825 take it easy on all the shouting its affecting my professional output
5174826 theres nothing that can replace being there for a reporter
5174827 it was my determination and desire to watch history in the making
5174828 so the israelis have no worries about the november election
5174829 i dont often answer my door with a gun in my hand
5174830 once he got the tire iron away from me my father pretty much took me apart
5174831 youre a bitter hateful man who doesnt know what to do with himself beyond get drunk and pick fights with a world thats not interested

5174833 the lost ogle satisfies our federally mandated rda for city buzz local celebrity gossip and female newscaster bikini photography
5174834 the times ive been on it some of their stuff has been pretty cute
5174835 despite questions about their origin the lost ogle serves up the wittiest most inventive and cutting edge commentary about the sooner state available today
5174836 i get a little nervous every time i go to it
5174837 the lost ogle is a wonderful place to spend time while in the midst of a 3 hour conference call second only to perhaps the okfuskee county jail
5174838 its like history on crack or meth more likely thanks guys
5174839 s lo una m nima parte de los miles de maestros interinos en el pa s se sum a este acto de simulaci n en el que ni siquiera se reconocieron las demandas m nimas para la cobertura de plazas docentes destinadas a egresados del normalismo p blico por entidad
5174840 saliera antes del debate energ tico en el congreso pues de lo contrario habr a un foco m s de tensi n pero ni as consiguieron que los miles de maestros que llevan a os esperando una plaza se inscribieran
5174841 no es casualidad que en baja california sur guerrero coahuila distrito federal puebla tamaulipas tlaxacala y zacatecas el porcentaje de aspirantes fuera mucho menor de lo esperado pues se han convertido en focos rojos del rechazo tanto a la ley del issste como a la aplicaci n de la llamada alianza por la calidad de la educaci n
5174842 se ha convertido en un riesgo porque ense a a formar ciudadanos democr ticos y honestos como debe ser la educaci n y no como ahora se pretende imponer con la alianza para que en el aula se forje mano de obra barata eficientes como obreros pero nulificados como ciudadanos
5174843 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

5174847 omega soil moisture data will help us build better weather models
5174848 by analyzing those microwaves we can tell how much moisture is in the soil
5174849 our instrument has to be ready to install on the p 3 by sept 15
5174850 well then fly missions over the delmarva peninsula between oct 1 and oct 14
5174851 another mission slated to fly on the p 3 scrubbed and a slot suddenly opened for us
5174852 weve really had to accelerate our schedule for developing mapir the intensity of the schedule is enormous trying to refocus and prepare for airworthiness reviews and other milestones the team has worked tirelessly and we have many more long days to come
5174853 with this aircraft well be able to do a lot of research locally i expect the flying tractor to be airborne before the end of the year
5174854 oh probably the hallucinations from stress and lack of sleep
5174855 corporate investment growth in 2007 08 and prospects for 2008 09 in its august bulletin it said downside risks to corporate profitability has risen due to higher global oil prices rising interest rates input and wage costs
5174856 with prospects of declerating pace in growth of domestic and global economy environment for the fixed investments due to its cyclical nature could become less conducive
5174857 hasta ahora las inundaciones han sido leves por lo que anoche la gente continu celebrando el carnaval
5174858 the safir ambassador rocket was successfully launched all its systems are iranian made
5174859 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in future
5174860 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5174861 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5174862 we do not wish to attack another country but we will defend ourselves should we be attacked
5174863 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians
5174864 im glad we didnt know at the beginning how hard it would be and how long it would take
5174865 but now that weve finally accomplished what we set out to do and much more besides it seems worth all the effort and all the headaches along the way
5174866 what amazes me is the huge range of the discoveries that have come from sdss data
5174867 we designed it primarily as a survey to map the distribution of galaxies and quasars but its also had a huge impact on the study of stars the structure of our own galaxy and even solar system objects
5174868 either we dont understand the way gravity works on the scale of the whole universe
5174869 or space is pervaded by some form of dark energy that produces repulsive gravity
5174870 even the early sdss images showed that the real milky way galaxy is much more complicated than the one i learned about in graduate school
5174871 segue has already shown us that there are important clues to the history of the galaxy and the properties of dark matter encoded in the motions of milky way stars
5174872 we expect to keep making important discoveries in the data for years to come
5174873 the ability of the sdss facility to simultaneously measure spectra of hundreds of objects over a wide area of sky remains a powerful tool for astronomy
5174874 sound waves that travel in the early universe imprint a characteristic scale on the distribution of galaxies which was first detected by the sdss
5174875 we can use this scale as a standard ruler to measure the expansion history of the universe much as supernovae have been used as standard candles
5174876 throughout its life the sdss has been a remarkable example of cooperation among public and private funding agencies and individual institutions around the world to enable science that would not otherwise be possible
5174877 visible light is where we understand the universe best but when we began the sdss there were no sensitive well characterized visible light catalogs that covered a large area of sky
5174878 now we have multi color images of 300 million celestial objects 3 dimensional maps and detailed properties of well over a million of them and its all publicly available online that changes everything
5174879 the goce mission team are receiving excellent support from our colleagues at esoc goce is a challenging mission and will orbit at an exceptionally low altitude of just 268 km so spacecraft control is very critical the simulations campaign is close to the end and we are fully ready to support the launch in september
5174880 this year we hope to send an indian spacecraft chandrayaan to the moon
5174881 i want to see a modern india imbued by a scientific temper where the benefits of modern knowledge flow to all sections of society
5174882 we intend to do a friendly takeover while we keep ouroptions open
5174883 i knew i should have gotten a zune they cant kill me or do anything else
5174884 i knew i should of goten a zune they cant kill me or do anything else
5174885 we can see little flashpoints in gas prices or a spike in joblessness but getting the whole picture is extremely difficult in part because were depending on government collected data which could often be three months later
5174886 is it a housing story is it a gasoline prices story is it an inflation story
5174887 we need to create other listening posts than the treasury department and the bureau of labor statistics
5174888 overall this is a hard story for journalists to tell because it isnt an event it isnt a person
5174889 and yet where they can get a handle on it its a story that people are eager to hear
5174890 astronomers have wondered for a quarter century whether these voids were too big or too empty to be explained by gravity alone
5174891 our analysis shows that the voids in these surveys are exactly as big and as empty as predicted by the standard theory of the universe
5174892 void statistics in large galaxy redshift surveys does halo occupation of field galaxies depend on environment
5174893 we wanted to see whether something strange is happening to the dark matter halos in the regions where we dont see galaxies
5174894 maybe the halos are there but they just dont manage to form stars then the voids would look emptier than they really are because they dont have anything our telescopes can see
5174895 when we used galaxies brighter than the milky way to trace structure the biggest empty voids we found were about 75 million light years across
5174896 red galaxies are made of old stars while a lot of the light in blue galaxies comes from young stars
5174897 halos of a given mass seem to form similar galaxies both in numbers of stars and in the ages of those stars regardless of where the halos live
5174898 void galaxies are different from typical galaxies in more crowded parts of the universe
5174899 the void galaxies are fainter bluer and are forming more stars but these differences may arise because these vast rural stretches of the universe contain lower mass halos than the cosmic cities and suburbs where most galaxies form
5174900 is one that i read long ago in the weekly world news everything in the voids was destroyed by space aliens during a giant intergalactic space war the real explanation seems to be much duller but more reassuring

5174907 i think hsbc has learnt the lesson that buying something because its cheap is not that good a thing to do on a four or five year view and i dont think they will this time around
5174908 they should preserve their capital and wait and see what the spanish economy serves up in the next 24 months
5174909 given recent sales trends and growing physician interest as well as recent congressional action to extend reimbursement rates for zevalin we believe we are on track to reach 15 million in annual net sales for zevalin this year
5174910 furthermore potential expansion of the label for zevalin based upon data we recently obtained from bayer schering pharmas first line indolent trial fit could support future sales growth in addition to our progress with zevalin we now have opaxios marketing authorization application under review in europe and expect results from our phase iii pixantrone trial in the fourth quarter
5174911 it was a suicide car bombing against the gates of the salerno camp

5174916 the president will address the nation at 1 00pm 0700 gmt
5174917 he is a wise man he is a very experienced man and he has seen the writing on the wall
5174918 he has seen the sentiments of not just the elected representatives but various institutions who all asked him to move in a particular way and do not destabilise things here
5174919 his political fate has been sealed whatever he says doesnt matter
5174920 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the

5175023 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5175024 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

5175031 i dont feel any regret about not going to athens you move on and you deal with it but to come from a nation thats so strong in terms of triathlon its a fantastic feeling to finally bring home a gold medal
5175032 dueling banjos playing relentlessly in my head we pushed our car further into the brush looking for this elusive gem of a house possibility for us where we can get away from noise and people we followed the red and white arrow signs hurrying us toward the fsbo i kept warning jeff that we needed to be careful lest we happen upon an angry hillbilly with an ax to grind we ended up on a steep cliff like ridge in the middle of a patch of briars even the british guy on the gps warned us even the gps is afraid of the hillbillies

5175087 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5175088 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5175089 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way

5175103 is it fair to criminalize such social relationships where no third party is harmed when a social relationship is forged which gives a new lease of life to both the stakeholders then law ought not to step in to criminalize and punish such relationships

5175110 i want to keep my soul fertile for the changes so things keep getting born in me so things keep dying when it is time for things to die i want to keep walking away from the person i was a moment ago because a mind was made to figure things out not to read the same page recurrently only the good stories have the characters different at the end than they were at the beginning and the closest thing i can liken life to is a book the way it stretches out on paper page after page as if to trick the mind into thinking it isnt all happening at once time has pressed you and me into a book too this tiny chapter we share together this vapor of a scene pulling our seconds into minutes and minutes into hours everything we were is no more and what we will become will become what was this is from where story stems the stuff of its construction lying at our feet like cut strips of philosophy i sometimes look into the endless heavens the cosmos of which we cant find the edge and ask god what it means did you really do all of this to dazzle us do you really keep it shifting rolling round the pinions to stave off boredom god forbid your glory would be our distraction and god forbid we would ignore your glory here is something i found to be true you dont start processing death until you turn thirty i live in visions for instance and they are cast out some fifty years and just now just last year i realized my visions were cast too far they were out beyond my life span it frightened me to think of it that i passed up an early marriage or children to write these silly books that i bought the lie that the academic life had to be separate from relational experience as though god only wanted us to learn cognitive ideas as if the heart of a man were only created to resonate with movies no life cannot be understood flat on a page it has to be lived a person has to get out of his head has to fall in love has to memorize poems has to jump off bridges into rivers has to stand in an empty desert and whisper sonnets under his breath ill tell you how the sun rose a ribbon at a time its a living book this life it folds out in a million settings cast with a billion beautiful characters and it is almost over for you it doesnt matter how old you are it is coming to a close quickly and soon the credits will roll and all your friends will fold out of your funeral and drive back to their homes in cold and still and silence and they will make a fire and pour some wine and think about how you once were and feel a kind of sickness at the idea you never again will be so soon you will be in that part of the book where you are holding the bulk of the pages in your left hand and only a thin wisp of the story in your right you will know by the page count not by the narrative that the author is wrapping things up you begin to mourn its ending and want to pace yourself slowly toward its closure knowing the last lines will speak of something beautiful of the end of something long and earned and you hope the thing closes out like last breaths like whispers about how much and who the characters have come to love and how authentic the sentiments feel when they have earned a hundred pages of qualification and so my prayer is that your story will have involved some leaving and some coming home some summer and some winter some roses blooming out like children in a play my hope is your story will be about changing about getting something beautiful born inside of you about learning to love a woman or a man about learning to love a child about moving yourself around water around mountains around friends about learning to love others more than we love ourselves about learning oneness as a way of understanding god we get one story you and i and one story alone god has established the elements the setting and the climax and the resolution it would be a crime not to venture out wouldnt it it might be time for you to go it might be time to change to shine out i want to repeat one word for you leave roll the word around on your tongue for a bit it is a beautiful word isnt it so strong and forceful the way you have always wanted to be and you will not be alone you have never been alone dont worry everything will still be here when you get back it is you who will have changed

5175117 i do not agree with that reasoning holiday economic because the meaning of the event the martyrdom of the late senator benigno aquino jr is diluted by transferring the actual celebration of the event to another date
5175118 i think the president is playing up to the crowd by saying we have an additional holiday but the net effect is that the transfer destroys the meaning and solemnity of the occasion
5175119 people should be reminded of an event that took place on a particular day and celebrate it accordingly even at some sacrifice

5175121 we are very disappointed liu xiang has been training very hard since athens to try and win the gold medal in beijing and has been under intense pressure

5175134 this centre will support companies by providing prototyping and testing facilities so the path between concept and application is shortened
5175135 it also will help companies cut through red tape to get to other government programs and act as a gateway to australias integration infrastructure in universities public research organisations and the rest of the private sector

5175139 the guidelines are designed to minimise the use of animals in scientific research through focusing on the three rs the replacement of animal research with other types of research when possible reduction of the number of animals used in research and refinement of research techniques to minimise pain and distress
5175140 when it is necessary to study animals in medical research all involved have an obligation to care for the animals in the best ways possible
5175141 but the issue remains though that while we have these great documents there is still no compulsory training for new and existing researchers on the laws and the best ways to reduce pain and distress
5175142 and they are not trained in the many excellent alternatives like computer modelling for example that can do just as good a job in testing without involving animals
5175143 at the moment there is a feeling there is far too much animal testing going on because of a lack of knowledge in many quarters and unfortunately a document while encouraging is not going to change that
5175144 all scientology processes address and handle a wide range of conditions affecting the spirit the being himself

5175146 it appears that several milf sub commanders are not controlled by the milf leadership and just using the peace process as a blanket to launch violent attacks against the people of mindanao
5175147 we have launched military operations in some areas in mindanao and this will go on until the perpetrators are punished and normalcy is established in the area
5175148 the afp shall not allow this to go on we cannot allow ambuscades arson kidnapping hostage taking blocking of main highways and other atrocities to be perpetrated by the milf against the filipino people
5175149 we have actually started filing formal charges in the joint ceasefire committee and in the proper courts against those who perpetrated those criminal acts
5175150 the peace process is a policy of government its not for the armed forces to declare so but we are addressing here are the criminal acts the actions of a portion or the factions of the milf

5175157 our kids dont learn by the sit down and shut up school of teaching anymore they learn through technology
5175158 the website is the starting point for students and parents to begin the lessons that will reach through the year
5175159 they say we need this how can we get it going
5175160 he told me how cool it would be if he had an rss feed from each of his teachers so he could have each one of his assignments pushed out to his igoogle page
5175161 is that you can put something out there and they can see it again and again
5175162 but it wont replace interactive questions and answers between teachers and students in the classroom because thats how students still learn best
5175163 i think its changing because kids are getting so good with computers that even the younger ones can play with the websites

5175168 allow market supply and demand to play a greater role enhance the flexibility of the exchange rate and bring into play the role of the exchange rate in optimizing resource allocation and reining in price rises
5175169 the growth of external demand has weakened which may indirectly have an impact on domestic investment and consumption for instance if some exporters have excess capacity and reduce investment but in general the factors supporting relatively fast growth in investment and consumption have not changed
5175170 the process of industrialization and urbanization on a large scale may lead to a relative shortage of primary commodities and continue to support their relatively high prices affecting domestic prices through trade channels there are still large gaps between the domestic and international prices of some primary commodities and the distortions caused by resource and energy prices continue to accumulate in addition labor costs and other factor prices are also rising quickly overall the risk of inflation cannot be ignored
5175171 from a long term perspective only by rationalizing resource prices can we use the power of pricing to increase supply and curb excessive demand encourage optimization of the economic structure and transformation of the mode of development and fundamentally ease inflationary pressures

5175174 the contractors are still working here and we will want to be talking to them to ascertain how it became flooded and why it didnt clear itself quickly as well as to make sure that this sort of thing doesnt happen in future
5175175 as a result northern ireland water was able to deploy resources and contractors throughout the event and around the clock
5175176 nevertheless such was the extremity of the rainfall that hundreds of homes were affected
5175177 our quarterly economic forecast highlights a significant worsening in uk economic prospects there is now a distinct possibility of technical recession the level of uk unemployment is likely to increase to nearly 300 000 over the next few years reaching almost two million an increase above two million cannot be ruled out
5175178 our view is that the threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation
5175179 the uk economy urgently needs an interest rate cut to counter threats of recession
5175180 whilst a marked slowdown in activity is likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut when inflation peaks the correct policy decisions are still needed to ward off the threats of a serious and prolonged recession the longer the mpc waits before cutting rates the bigger the danger that the economic situation would deteriorate
5175181 we will be presenting the list as part of a resolution and charge sheet in the joint houses and god willing that should happen this week

5175185 this is an issue that is not on the table
5175186 we want stability in the country we want political stability
5175187 i think he may have wanted to win too much and could have caved under the pressure the injury may be an excuse
5175188 its not important at all whether he wins or loses
5175189 so i guess thats why he gave up at the last minute
5175190 lets be realistic liu is a human not a god
5175191 there are seats that we could have would have should have liked to have candidates for
5175192 it appears at this point a missed opportunity for the democrats in not filling those seats but thats more easily said than done for a party that struggles to even maintain major party status in this state
5175193 i hope republicans reach across the aisle and give us a big handshake when people like lynn luker get into office only because they were unopposed because this is the last year they get a freebie
5175194 thats nice that democrats are looking to do that kind of thing in the future were looking to do it today
5175195 if they could get george bush to run for a third term that would help

5175212 the sheer cost of living and doing business is driving many people out of new york state especially with antiquated laws the scaffolding law
5175213 one of the issues is the scaffolding law which basically is very devastating it increases their cost of insurance and in some cases makes insurance unavailable to them what most people dont know is it can add maybe 10 000 to the cost of their home just because of the one specific law

5175217 oil and natural gas corporation limited ongc s standalone net sales jumped 46 5 yoy to rs 200 5 billion on the back of higher net realisations at the current market price cmp the stock is trading at a forward p e of 9 1x for fy09e and 8 8x for fy10e based on our target price of rs 1 170 we believe that the stock is fairy valued thus we downgrade our rating to hold
5175218 hindalco is a value stock but not a momentum stock and its subsidiary novelis is really the key driver for the stock for the next two years the dilution is 5 higher than what we expected but it doesnt alter the call the earnings downgrade will be around 5 i am not sure because the consensus have not yet factored in the previous indication of rs 115 share so for them it would be around 10 12 dilution which they will be coming up with we had already factored in so for us the change would be around 4 5
5175219 we have a outperform recommendation with a target price of around rs 184 or somewhere there we are unlikely to change that too much just tinker it for the 5 extra dilution the fy10 eps is at rs 14 5 but that was on rs 115 rights issue which would now undergo slight shift downwards
5175220 we are positive for aluminium and we are saying that aluminium prices are going to remain at high levels of around usd 3 000 the prime driver is going to be the cost because energy costs are very high globally though we also believe that there is no shortage of aluminium in the global market that will keep a check on any further price increase from usd 3 000 level so more or less one can say that the cost push and the excess of supply are going to keep aluminium prices at balanced level

5175236 the critical difference is that the liberal national party will be paying you for every bit of energy that the solar panels you have generates
5175237 compare that to what labors proposing where theyre only going to pay you for the surplus and for most homes we use more energy than we create at the moment
5175238 what weve seen is that those people who do have a solar panel on their home are actually taking this up at a very very quick rate

5175307 dan sebagai suatu tanda buat mereka ialah bumi yang mati kering kami hidupkan kembali dan kami keluarkan dari sana benih yang sebagian dapat dimakan disana kami adakan kebun kebun kurma dan palm dan anggur dan disana pula kami pancarkan mata air supaya dapat mereka makan buahnya semua itu bukan usaha tangan mereka kenapa mereka tidak berterima kasih maha suci yang telah menciptakan semua yang ditumbuhkan bumi berpasang pasangan dan dalam diri mereka sendiri serta segala apa yang tiada mereka ketahui juga sebagai suatu tanda buat mereka ialah malam kami lepaskan siang maka mereka pun berada dalam kegelapan matahari pun beredar menurut ketetapan yang sudah ditentukan itulah ukuran dari yang maha kuasa dan maha tahu juga bulan sudah kami tentukan tempat tempatnya sampai ia kembali lagi seperti mayang yang sudah tua matahari tiada sepatutnya akan mengejar bulan dan malam pun tiada akan mendahului siang masing masing berjalan dalam peredarannya juga sebagai suatu tanda buat mereka ialah turunan mereka yang kami angkut dalam kapal yang penuh muatan dan buat mereka kami ciptakan pula yang serupa yang dapat mereka kendarai kalau kami kehendaki kami karamkan mereka tiada penolong lagi buat mereka juga mereka tak dapat diselamatkan kecuali dengan rahmat dari kami dan untuk memberikan kesenangan hidup sampai pada waktunya

5175311 he retold his story of a christmas day celebration outside his cell when a prison guard etched a cross into the dirt for a moment we were just two christians worshipping there raw story have noticed too
5175312 along with other prisoners he worked in the fields day after day in rain and sun during summer and winter his life appeared to be nothing more than backbreaking labor and slow starvation the intense suffering reduced him to a state of despair on one particular day the hopelessness of his situation became too much for him he saw no reason to continue his struggle no reason to keep on living his life made no difference in the world so he gave up leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners as he waited head down he felt a presence slowly he looked up and saw a skinny old prisoner squat down beside him the man said nothing instead he used a stick to trace in the dirt the sign of the cross the man then got back up and returned to his work as solzhenitsyn stared at the cross drawn in the dirt his entire perspective changed he knew he was only one man against the all powerful soviet empire yet he knew there was something greater than the evil he saw in the prison camp something greater than the soviet union he knew that hope for all people was represented by that simple cross through the power of the cross anything was possible solzhenitsyn slowly rose to his feet picked up his shovel and went back to work outwardly nothing had changed inside he had received hope
5175313 for the 26th time every year in the winter and in the summer tel aviv is proud to present the official city designer market with 140 israeli clothing designers featuring shoes accessories clothing from casual street wear to fancy fancy evening gown hand bags hats jewelry and basically anything you consider fashion all made in israel the designers which are presenting in the market have been chosen carefully by the organizers of the event and they are supposed to help project the right energy young urban and exciting one of the main goals is to give a platform for young designers a chance to show their design and maybe even be discovered as a loyal fan of this market i think i went to 13 14 of the events i can give you a historical look at the event and there are many designers which where first discovered here and become a big hit in tlv fashion such as anna k karin a shine anat manos mal ruby star and many many more young talents other than all this fun filled fashion the event will include some tlvs leading d js on site lots and lots of alcohol and many other surprises the best part of the market is that the prices are actually very low i mean its all relative and designer clothing is never really cheap but still we are talking between 30 70 off and this can allow us common girls to get some real shopping done despite my grand introduction about this being a women only event this year there are a few 5 to be accurate representatives of mens apparel so maybe you boys will be doing more than just holding your girlfriends purse while shes trying everything on let the shopping begin

5175320 depart from me because i was hungry and you did not feed me i was thirsty and you did not give me to drink i was sick and you did not visit me
5175321 when did we see you hungry or thirsty or sick and did not come to your help
5175322 whatever you neglected to do unto one of these least of these you neglected to do unto me
5175323 my peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you
5175324 whatever you did to the least of these you did to me and he will also say to those on his left whatever you neglected to do for the least of these you neglected to do it for me
5175325 and see this neglect to love brings spiritual poverty maybe in our own family we have somebody who is feeling lonely who is feeling sick who is feeling worried are we there are we willing to give until it hurts in order to be with our families or do we put our own interests first these are the questions we must ask ourselves especially as we begin this year of the family we must remember that love begins at home and we must also remember that the future of humanity passes through the family i was surprised in the west to see so many young boys and girls given to drugs and i tried to find out why why is it like that when those in the west have so many more things than those in the east and the answer was because there is no one in the family to receive them our children depend on us for everything their health their nutrition their security their coming to know and love god for all of this they look to us with trust hope and expectation but often father and mother are so busy they have no time for their children or perhaps they are not even married or have given up on their marriage so their children go to the streets and get involved in drugs or other things we are talking of love of the child which is were love and peace must begin these are the things that greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion because it is a war against the child a direct killing of the innocent child murder by the mother herself and if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child how can we tell other people not to kill one another how do we persuade a woman not to have an abortion as always we must persuade her with love and we remind ourselves that love means to be willing to give until it hurts jesus gave even his life to love us so the mother who is thinking of abortion should be helped to love that is to give until it hurts her plans or her free time to respect the life of her child the father of that child whoever he is must also give until it hurts by abortion the mother does not learn to love but kills even her own child to solve her problems and by abortion that father is told that he does not have to take any responsibility at all for the child he has brought into the world the father is likely to put other women into the same trouble so abortion just leads to more abortion any country that accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love but to use any violence to get what they want this is why the greatest destroyer of love and peace is abortion many people are very very concerned with the children of india with the children of africa where quite a few die of hunger and so on many people are also concerned about all the violence in this great country of the united states these concerns are very good but often these same people are not concerned with the millions who are being killed by the deliberate decision of their own mothers and this is what is the greatest destroyer of peace today abortion which brings people to such blindness and for this i appeal in india and i appeal everywhere the child is gods gift to the family each child is created in the special image and likeness of god for greater things to love and to be loved in this year of the family we must bring the child back to the center of our care and concern this is the only way that our world can survive because our children are the only hope for the future as older people are called to god only their children can take their places even if a mother could forget her child i will not forget you i have carved you in the palm of my hand
5175326 please dont destroy the child we will take the child
5175327 come we will take care of you we will get a home for your child

5175351 un precio razonable y acorde a los costos actuales de producci n deber a rondar entre 80 y 85 la bolsa
5175352 m s all de esto hay una evoluci n favorable que esperamos que se consolide a partir de que se inyecten al mercado los recursos del banco naci n
5175353 alrededor del 30 del az car que se produce en la argentina se comercializa a precios de absoluto quebranto en el exterior por lo tanto el 70 restante se debe vender a valores rentables

5175362 emigrar profundiz mi vocaci n porque quiz el nico lugar que segu a teniendo y no hab a cambiado era la escritura
5175363 lo mismo que ha significado siempre que eres adicto a contar historias y que te enamora el lenguaje
5175364 la historia de la literatura atraves ya muchos cambios tecnol gicos con sus respectivos anuncios apocal pticos cuando se invent la imprenta muchos creyeron que al excluir los manuscritos esta terminar a da ando el arte pero el quijote de la mancha es hijo de la imprenta
5175365 pero esa concepci n fue reemplazada por la del escritor haciendo ruido con los dedos
5175366 hay una especie de mito intimidador que suelen transmitir los escritores maduros que a menudo exhortan a leer mucho antes de escribir
5175367 im not sure i can wait another eight years to play in another olympics though it took me 12 years to get here
5175368 that was the most intense race ive done for so long
5175369 we made a bit of a mistake at the beginning
5175370 every other boat who had a medal chance wanted to cover us but then we did a good run and took a couple of boats
5175371 at one point we thought wed lost it three races ago we looked like we had no chance of a medal
5175372 we had our backs against the wall silver was the best we could do and that was hard to take im really pleased we turned it around
5175373 in athens we were going in with a chance to win gold and we didnt
5175374 well it feels nice to work in different countries know the culture and musical tastes of the people across borders
5175375 es un reportaje totalmente ap crifo y una declaraci n completamente falsa
5175376 ya en aquel entonces hab a acusaciones falsas contra nuestra heroica direccion por complicidad con genocidio
5175377 el primer ataque que citar es la caza de brujas social fascista organizada desde la casa rosada con el apoyo del imperio chino y los seguidores del brutus fans club pero que comenz antes en los medios alternativos mediante arteros infundios sobre nuestro pasado intachable
5175378 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that some day there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects

5175380 in the intelligence community there is an extremely small number of people who understand the science and without that its going to be impossible to predict surprises this is a black hole that needs to be filled with light
5175381 were not going to be reading minds at a distance but that doesnt mean we cant detect gross changes in anxiety or fear and then subsequently talk to those individuals to see whats upsetting them
5175382 tell anybody youre a sculptor and theyll say oh how exciting how wonderful and i tend to say whats so wonderful its like being a mason or a carpenter half the time but they dont wish to hear that because they really only imagine the first part the exciting part but as khrushchev once said that doesnt fry pancakes you see that germ of an idea does not make a sculpture which stands up it just sits there so the next stage is the hard work can you really translate it into a piece of sculpture
5175383 when i have a job that takes a lot of effort slowly i pretend im in jail if im in jail time is of no consequence in other words if it takes a week to cut this itll take a week what else have i got to do im going to be here for twenty years see this is a kind of mental trick otherwise you say my god its not working and then you make mistakes my way you say time is of absolutely no consequence
5175384 this idea to create something is not my aim to be different is a negative motive and no creative thought or created thing grows out of a negative impulse a negative impulse is always frustrating and to be different means not like this and not like that and the not like thats why postmodernism with the prefix of post couldnt work no negative impulse can work can produce any happy creation only a positive one
5175385 id say one of the most common failures of able people is a lack of nerve theyll play safe games in innovation you have to play a less safe game if its going to be interesting its not predictable that itll go well
5175386 i think it is very important to find a way to be detached from what you write so that you cant be so identified with your work that you cant accept criticism and response and that is the danger of having as much affect as i do but i am aware of that and of when i think it is particularly important to detach oneself from the work and that is something where age really does help

5175391 el gobierno cambi la forma de comunicarse con los medios de prensa y la sociedad haya actitud de b squeda de di logo la misma presidenta ha tratado de cambiar pero eso es un estilo pero en las pol ticas en el sector de l cteos las empresas m s concentradas siguen ganando pero en el c rnico siguen ganado los frigor ficos amigos del gobierno por ejemplo samid le aument 100 la carne a los consumidores y nosotros hace dos o tres a os que estamos vendiendo novillo al mismo precio

5175428 its going to rock us pretty hard he was just a good bloke
5175429 he was top notch he was a real genuine bloke
5175430 his funeral is going to be absolutely enormous because youd be hard pressed to finding someone who didnt get along well with tom
5175431 tom had been talking about me joining him on this trip for about the last two months
5175432 then he left a message on my facebook telling me he was going down saying sorry about the late notice but im heading down to the snow are you still keen
5175433 i dont check my facebook that regularly and i checked it on saturday and i was like damn i missed out and then this happened
5175434 never shy of a fun time old tommy he was a good social lad
5175435 he was an adventurous one he came up to newcastle not that long ago to do a scuba diving course with his bro and he was big on his skiing
5175436 he was always doing something adventurous he was into rock climbing and any sort of adventure sport
5175437 i know a lot of the boys at the schools were pretty fond of him because he was a young guy that was into rugby and whatnot i think he really got on well with the students that didnt get along with other teachers
5175438 this tragic loss comes at a time when mr carr boyd was just starting out on a promising teaching career
5175439 the school offers its sincere sympathy to mr family and friends
5175440 his place in sydney was a social hub for everyone his doors were always open for guests passing through or staying the night

5175526 i was so overworked i used to get annoyed sometimes if they finished the dry rotis i packed for them in the morning when vikas was about five he once came and asked me for some money what do you want it for i asked him he told me he wanted to go to the market and buy some friends
5175527 it is difficult to understand baba unless you met him to talk of him now is like the story of the six blind men describing an elephant
5175528 i went to anandwan and offered baba some money more than money we need people baba said to me
5175529 is to trace the stories and observe the people who were drawn to him
5175530 in a sense we were afraid of baba and when we were in school and college we were always under such public scrutiny as babas sons we could not even go to see a film i felt that as a torture in my life
5175531 for years people thought we were the useless sons of a big man
5175532 and you could say we had a tacit sibling rivalry with hundreds of people when we were growing up but none of that really mattered what i admired most about baba was his compassion my earliest memories are of watching him tend personally to the sores of the leprosy patients in anandwan and i think that karuna seeped into me
5175533 baba once told me he wished he had been my son rather than my father
5175534 baba passed away on february 9 this year but we didnt declare it a holiday in anandwan
5175535 baba never wanted to be deified his death should mean nothing to us because he was not an era he was a thought process and we have to live out that thought and make it grow
5175536 my father always says this was not meant to be baba amte and sons pvt ltd and it is true we need new blood new young people to join the work
5175537 the real measure of babas work is that those who were in distress can now help others
5175538 if i am born again and i am born a cripple i will have no regrets
5175539 are you an articulator of strategy or are you a strategist
5175540 when we really want to know about the person and how whatever we are researching fits into his context without even telling what we are exactly looking for
5175541 i would like to understand you as a person ur schooling ur college and then how is life today your job etc
5175542 most of the times people came to the point surprisingly with out even me asking about the specific point
5175543 its common sense organic food is good food good to eat good for the environment good for the small scale farmers and farm workers who produce it
5175544 we were going down the second fairway and my caddie mark long said lets say you are four behind
5175545 we were trying to make it as if we were behind all day dont protect anything and fire at all the flags
5175546 he got to 6 up after 15 and i just took my foot off the gas
5175547 i would try to explain that the cartoon was not aimed at islam as a whole but aimed at the terrorists who use part of islam as their spiritual ammunition you could also say that the terrorists have taken the prophet as their hostage
5175548 if our wives could see us now i do hope they are better off in their camps and dont know what is happening to us
5175549 the angels are lost in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory
5175550 as such i also bear witness to the unexpected extent to which man is capable of defying and braving even the worst conditions conceivable

5175554 which seems like it will be little help in this nationalist explosion in the caucus which is rapidly becoming the other balkans
5175555 he was far more flexible and pragmatic about a resolution of the tibet question than public statements had led me to believe but he also wonders if his engagement policy with china is getting anywhere if the stalemate continues
5175556 they havent talked about it yet but its all up to michael patrick king if he wants to write another one wed love to do it
5175557 it was a great experience and we had a lot of fun making it
5175558 from the reports that ive been getting it is all females in the audience and i know it is a movie that attracts women but guys are allowed to go to this movie just so you know in australia he said
5175559 guys you wont be persecuted if you go to this movie
5175560 i didnt really with struggle with it it felt pretty natural
5175561 theyve all been very polite and i couldnt ask for more
5175562 you dont take cues from the entertainment business to learn something as complicated as the female species he said
5175563 one of the things i liked about it apart from the laughs and the fashion is the friendship and forgiveness which were underplayed in the movie
5175564 people come back together because they loved each other enough to forgive and you can laugh along the way which is what makes it work
5175565 im not exactly tech savvy but we like to know that its there and usable for people who didnt get past fifth grade math

5175568 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

5175570 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5175571 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5175572 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5175573 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5175574 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5175575 i am a girl and i have the right to change my mind

5175675 im a bloke who respects women i believe we should look after women
5175676 im told men outnumber women here by five to one if thats the case then perhaps its an opportunity for some lonely women
5175677 its not councils view and its not mine its hard when youve got to defend something someone else has said were definitely appalled
5175678 its a public attack on women and a form of verbal and emotional abuse
5175679 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything i think its quite disgusting if he wants to come and visit our service im more than happy to have a yarn to him about what hes saying
5175680 theyre very archaic comments i dont think he realises the repercussions of labelling women based solely on their looks

5175695 we will also investigate internally how this incident took place and who was involved and make whatever decisions are necessary to ensure that this kind of situation never happens again
5175696 the expectations we set for everyone at joe gibbs racing begins with me and i personally apologize to nascar our partners and our fans for the negative light this situation has cast upon all of us
5175697 i know theyre probably frustrated from the standpoint that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and we want to make it look like were handicapped more than ever before i understand that but thats not an excuse
5175698 we show up fast but we cant put a whole race together so weve got to do some homework weve got to science it out and figure out what the heck is going on because we are sure fast when that race starts but ive been like that my whole career

5175713 not only have the number of missed appointments increased every year in the last five years but also even given the qualifications in the information the waste of money to the trust is significant
5175714 if these costs were not being occurred it would mean extra money to be invested in patient care
5175715 to my mind there is no excuse for people failing to meet their appointments without giving reasonable notice to the trust
5175716 we always try to give patients as much notice as possible of an appointment but as waiting times come down this is more difficult as we want patients to be able to access our services as quickly as possible
5175717 we always give patients more than two weeks notice of an appointment unless there is a clinical reason to make it sooner or the patient is happy to accept it sooner
5175718 with more patients using the choose and book system they are able to choose the date and time of their appointment rather than it being allocated by the hospital so they can make it at their convenience suffolk homes

5175723 i had no self worth i had no time to reflect i was going out getting drunk relationships very difficult i was always running awards didnt sink in nothing was enough or good enough i was driven person life was like an express train everything was going so fast that i couldnt even enjoy the scenery
5175724 light just came on it was extraordinary it was something where i could channel all my feelings
5175725 it is something i continue to be passionate about your whole day is centred around that two and half hours on stage
5175726 it always make me laugh id sort of say im going to my boyfriends tonight nobody knew who he was
5175727 it was very exciting but i genuinely fell in love with him
5175728 i think i had hopes that we could walk on in our relationship but really and truthfully i think i was very aware that i wouldnt be able to do what i do for a living if id have stayed with him
5175729 if you think about it i would be in the theatre doing eight shows a week theyd have to check out the theatre every night check everyones bags it would be just impossible and there was nothing at that stage that was more important than what i did
5175730 its full on and its constant but i wouldnt change it it keeps you down to earth i am much more comfortable in own skin at 41 than i was before and i finally have a sense of peace

5175767 yep thats a lump looks like a lymph node to me

5175770 if by chance there becomes any way to move up the surgery date
5175771 you know this feels like its right under the surface
5175772 not a problem when im in there i can check them out and if necessary take them out too but what has me concerned is that he also found a spot on the back of your tongue back where it connects just above your voice box now this could be a tonsil that has gone nuts in turn sending enough junk into your lymph system to freak out the nodules but id like to change the scope of the surgery to include that spot
5175773 as he kind of frantically flips through the paper work

5175778 a belief in free will contradicts the known fact that the universe is governed by lawful principles of science
5175779 one might also be tempted to use these results to argue that belief in free will is important from a moral perspective whether or not it actually exists
5175780 morality is a dependant concept of free will if there is no objective existance of free will then morality is a null concept meaning that it in turn describes something that also has no objective existance
5175781 reading statements about determinism and the possibility of the lack of existence of free will increases awareness of the true nature of situations
5175782 if the experimenter doesnt believe in free will the experimenter cant blame me for taking money
5175783 lets be really clear here there is no evidence that the concept of free will has any objective existance what so ever
5175784 there had better be somebody who is in charge and by god it had better be me

5175788 the patient must utilise the technology usefully in the correct perspective instead of dissection discussion and hair splitting
5175789 the internet which is very useful to most of us can supply ideas to the patient to gain knowledge to pose intelligent questions to the urologist and forget the actual purpose of the visit to the doctor

5175793 being promoted to bbc one and gaining a wider audience
5175794 it obviously came as quite a shock we had a pretty close school group were all pretty close
5175795 its going to rock us pretty hard he was just a good bloke
5175796 he was top notch he was a real genuine bloke
5175797 his funeral is going to be absolutely enormous because youd be hard pressed to finding someone who didnt get along well with tom
5175798 tom had been talking about me joining him on this trip for about the last two months
5175799 then he left a message on my facebook telling me he was going down saying sorry about the late notice but im heading down to the snow are you still keen
5175800 i dont check my facebook that regularly and i checked it on saturday and i was like damn i missed out and then this happened
5175801 never shy of a fun time old tommy he was a good social lad
5175802 he was an adventurous one he came up to newcastle not that long ago to do a scuba diving course with his bro and he was big on his skiing
5175803 he was always doing something adventurous he was into rock climbing and any sort of adventure sport
5175804 i know a lot of the boys at the schools were pretty fond of him because he was a young guy that was into rugby and whatnot i think he really got on well with the students that didnt get along with other teachers
5175805 this tragic loss comes at a time when mr carr boyd was just starting out on a promising teaching career
5175806 the school offers its sincere sympathy to mr family and friends
5175807 his place in sydney was a social hub for everyone his doors were always open for guests passing through or staying the night
5175808 they were the closest to us before the war and now they are the most frightening enemy
5175809 it feels like your own brother has cut off your head
5175810 after what happened it should be clear that they should have self determination
5175811 the reality is that for 15 years at least south ossetia and abkhazia have been independent in fact
5175812 its not true the goal of russia is peace in the caucasus
5175813 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5175814 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
5175815 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment
5175816 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5175817 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5175818 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5175819 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5175820 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5175821 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5175822 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5175823 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5175824 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5175825 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5175826 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5175827 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5175828 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5175829 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5175830 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5175831 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5175832 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
5175833 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile
5175834 so badly that he died in hungary in november 1944 the perth magistrates court has been told

5175839 they spent thursday night and friday morning without their medication
5175840 these children could run the risk of developing drug resistance and that could get worse and mean they are shortening their lives

5175848 it is really a miracle for zhang ning to retain the olympic gold her entrance to the beijing olympic games was even in doubt two months ago
5175849 there was a period when badminton in korea was very disappointing and it felt like the world had stopped i feel elated about this achievement
5175850 chong wei will still be considered a hero because he has contributed a silver to the country and at the same time ended a 12 year wait as malaysia had not won a single medal since the 1996 edition
5175851 it was extremely hard it was hot i think it was a great course for a triathlon it was a really tough course
5175852 i feel very proud and honoured to be an australian with a gold medal around my neck at the olympic games
5175853 i believe we came so close in sydney and athens that this makes up for those very close defeats
5175854 i dont feel any regret about not going to athens you move on and you deal with it but to come from a nation thats so strong in terms of triathlon its a fantastic feeling to finally bring home a gold medal

5175866 especially in recent weeks he talked about it suicide on occasion he just felt he had come up against a giant wall that he couldnt get over i think he just saw no way out the money was gone as he used it to support himself when he started writing a couple of years ago
5175867 in looking back there were signs that he had it all planned out
5175868 he really changed a few years ago he suddenly wanted to become a writer and he was a good one
5175869 i remember one evening he called my house on his cell phone and said let me in or ill kill myself my wife lisa and i did and i stayed up into the early morning hours drinking with kevin no doubt he had become quite frustrated with the way things were going
5175870 ill never forget the time he had flown in from phoenix to john wayne airport and was toting around an ice cooler filled with beer and champagne
5175871 i yelled out to him dr russell did you bring the heart and kevin not skipping a beat looked at the cooler grimly and said no i brought the liver instead there were a lot of people around listening to the conversation and they suddenly had horrified looks on their faces
5175872 i remember once when were playing golf at big rec and we reached the 12th tee with a shortage of alcohol
5175873 kevin jumps into a golf cart and says to me cmon lets go and he drives down santiago and then across pch to hody lane liquor where he tools through the front door buys a bottle of myers rum and goes out the back door it was a pretty hilarious scene

5175951 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

5175955 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5175956 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5175957 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5175958 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5175959 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5175960 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5175961 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5175962 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5175963 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5175964 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5175965 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5175966 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5175967 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5175968 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5175969 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5175970 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5175971 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5175972 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5175973 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5175974 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5175975 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5175976 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5175977 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5175978 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5175979 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5175980 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5175981 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5175982 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5175983 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5175984 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5175985 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5175986 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5175987 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5175988 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5175989 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5175990 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5175991 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5175992 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5175993 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5175994 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5175995 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5175996 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5175997 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5175998 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5175999 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5176000 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5176001 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5176002 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5176003 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5176004 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5176005 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5176006 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5176007 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5176008 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5176009 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5176010 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5176011 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5176012 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5176013 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5176014 even death bitches say hi to me she tell her blind friends and she say i gotta see

5176020 sudah pihak kejati sudah lakukan koordinasi menyangkut permintaan regu tembak bagi pelaksaan eksekusi namun demikian kecil kemungkinan polisi bali yang akan melakukan itu
5176021 bisa saja sih dari bali namun nampaknya lebih besar kemungkinannya dari polda jateng
5176022 lokasinya di jatang kan alangkah lebih efektif dan efisiennya bila dilakukan oleh polda jateng
5176023 bila sewaktu waktu diminta untuk melaksanakan eksekusi kita sudah siap
5176024 kita sudah koordinasikan dengan polisi agar sewaktu waktu bila diminta segalanya sudah siap
5176025 bila regu tembak telah siap kan kapan saja diminta tinggal jalan
5176026 teman saya meninggal waktu zaman revolusi tahun 1945 terkena granat
5176027 saat itu kami tidak punya alat alat perang yang cukup setiap anggota kompi bisa pegang tiga granat saja itu sudah tergolong bagus dan beliau temannya red meninggal terkena pecahan granat saat bertugas mengambil logistik bagi keperluan perjuangan
5176028 tadinya saya ingin menghabiskan waktu pensiun di sukabumi tapi anak anak saya lahir dan besar di sini akhirnya saya putuskan tetap di sini saja

5176030 pemikiran pemikiran dalam rangka peringatan 100 tahun kebangkitan bangsa dan 10 tahun era reformasi
5176031 walaupun mereka sudah menjadi warga negara amerika mereka terlihat antusias ketika meneriakkan kata merdeka tentu dengan lidah yang sudah amerika ketimbang indonesia
5176032 kita harus menghadapinya dengan tenang tetapi harus ada penindakan hukum secara tegas sambil mempercepat keadilan politik ekonomi dan sosial budaya di beberapa daerah yang kerap muncul aksi anti nkri
5176033 dengan pemerataan tersebut maka aksi anti nkri dapat dikurangi baik secara kualitas maupun kuantitas
5176034 itu jelas perbuatan yang tidak dapat dibenarkan merupakan penghinaan terhadap kedaulatan negara karena itu harus ditindak tegas karena ini masalah hukum maka biarlah pihak kepolisian yang mengusut dan menuntaskannya kami hanya membantu
5176035 people really do appear more attractive when our perceptions are changed by drinking alcohol
5176036 we must wait for the repaired tracks to settle down
5176037 if the czech republic had proceeded in a similar way the risks related to stationing the radar on czech soil could be more acceptable for the czech public
5176038 building a significant portfolio of certificates from co2 emissions savings abroad is one of a set of strategic measures by which we react to the planned energy and climate change package of the eu
5176039 china offers a lot of promising possibilities in this respect
5176040 we wanted anyone to appear and to tell us what they think about the developments in georgia
5176041 we are ready to say that this is an unauthorised event but we respect the czech police who have recommended to us not to escalate the situation
5176042 i think i would have been ashamed and reluctant to go to the doctor but it always helps to have somebody around you who has had some experience
5176043 i think people will think twice or more times before they actually think maybe i should go to a doctor
5176044 under communism many dissidents were sent to psychiatric hospitals without having any mental illness
5176045 for example now my employer knows that i am taking medicine i wasnt afraid to tell him about it because i am on very good terms with him but if i were applying for another job and they were asking about my health i would never tell them
5176046 people do not talk about mental health especially something like depression that hasnt changed much since 20 years ago
5176047 they come with depression or anxiety and this type of medication is the treatment of choice if i feel that their problem is treatable solely with psychotherapy then i refer them to psychologists or psychotherapists
5176048 its not uncommon to dole out medication instead of sending the patient for a psychiatric referral or therapy
5176049 medication can be really worthwhile to help certain people lead normal lives
5176050 but its really important to know each specific patient you cant just use a cookie cutter recipe for everyone
5176051 for the first time i realized therapy is just as important a part of treating bipolar disorder as the medicine
5176052 you have to think it will pass sooner or later but at that moment i thought well i dont know i dont know how long it will be and i dont want to wait that long
5176053 i found it quite disturbing you are in a room and all the patients stand up and they talk to the doctor about how they are feeling in front of all the other patients i found it very embarrassing
5176054 now with the baby born i think everything will quiet down
5176055 well it wont be quiet obviously well be very busy
5176056 they examined whether i am not holding something in the rectum
5176057 it knees bending is a common practice but for me who lived in civilised conditions it was unacceptable
5176058 they read my correspondence even though this was not admissible in my type of custody it was cold in the cell because there it was not heated up
5176059 the warders take care of the convicts they try to re educate them custody is a service for the police the people are discarded there and they are bored
5176060 in england in the 1970s and 1980s i saw televison reports which showed recruits to the neo nazi movement when i arrived back in australia in 1986 i saw that we had an australian neo nazi movement the leader was jailed and the movement banned
5176061 the funny thing is that the australian leader looked similar in physical appearance to the british recruits they mostly seemed to be of milky complexion inclined to be flabby had very short haircuts and were ignorant and fearful to me they all looked like butchers apprentices
5176062 rapid and decisive action is needed rather than permitting the movement to spread but something has to be put in its place to divert the energies of these disenfranchised youths
5176063 effort and imagination are required to move these aimless ignorant and destructive youths towards the pursuit of constructive goals they will get more out of life if they are shown how to achieve and meet meaningful challenges recognition of their personal abilities building their skills showing appreciation and offering rewards for good effort team work team building ethics and showing them how they could plan their lives towards success and self reliance could be part of the plan
5176064 tourism in our country is by no means on the downside just the opposite there is some development
5176065 hotels with which we cooperate mostly ascribe the fall in the number of foreign clients to the strong crown hotel owners are currently looking for ways to address czech clients who have to a certain extent been neglected thus far
5176066 i knew that the shots may be of importance only if they were released abroad this was also because the russians prepared two versions of the events in one czechs welcome their arrival like in 1945 while in the other czechs shoot at them like people did in hungary in 1956
5176067 our camera showed shooting burning people yet women with handbags were passing by which was absurd and made it look like an attack by martians
5176068 we see the half yearly results given the situation on the markets as clearly positive
5176069 threatened one arbitrator with the removal of the arbitration file and with the imposing of a fine up to 50 000 crowns
5176070 mija you can be the first woman president if you want to be

5176072 the containership market has eased this year particularly on the asia us and asia europe routes although eastern hemisphere trading has remained robust
5176073 the major focus is either sale leasebacks with top quality liner operators taking over distressed newbuild construction slots or acquiring smaller companies with cash flow and or credit shortfalls
5176074 the proposed sale of our retail fuels marketing operations in brazil is consistent with our ongoing effort to concentrate downstream resources and capital on strategic global assets
5176075 by restructuring our worldwide portfolio we intend to reduce capital employed deliver stronger returns and achieve more profitable growth

5176084 if someone forces you to go one mile go with him two miles
5176085 this goes hand in hand with my goal of changing swimming
5176086 i think its probably one of the greatest things sport in general has ever seen
5176087 the shame of it is other athletes arent going to realize how hard it is the world is fast in swimming right now the world was not fast when mark
5176088 i just feel very privileged that i got to watch michael phelps win eight gold medals thats been the highlight of my olympics
5176089 when you come out and swim fast times people realize that it can be done
5176090 you set that bar a bit high and people are going to come with you
5176091 and it kind of makes the rest of us look like if we dont win a gold medal
5176092 i was absolutely to the point of where i was like oh my gosh
5176093 doing all best times winning every race everything was accomplished that i wanted to do its been one fun week thats for sure

5176104 i was actually in love once trouble was well i dont rightly know it just was we never talked about it being in love i mean we just were each day better than the one previous each caress more tender kiss more passionate each thrust deeper than the one before i had never felt that way before nor since perhaps never again forever stuck in my childishness
5176105 though never in love without a doubt in something so real but only in those breif instances when together alone or alone together his blood on me i hardly knew him then though time proved us worthy my blood on him the worth the reason for forgiveness drunken poetry during very early hours of the morning i miss him

5176116 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5176117 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5176118 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5176136 the mawson lakes centre continues the australian governments commitment to sa and would link companies to resources in the regions and nationally forming networks to build a permanent and readily accessible national knowledge bank
5176137 government has a responsibility to help businesses grow and prosper
5176138 this centre will support companies by providing prototyping and testing facilities so the path between concept and application is shortened
5176139 it also will help companies cut through red tape to get to other government programs and act as a gateway to australias integration infrastructure in universities public research organisations and the rest of the private sector

5176144 back in the reagan years the national endowment for democracy was created as a cold war tool today the ned is a neocon controlled agent for us world hegemony its main function is to pour us money and election rigging into former constituent parts of the soviet union in order to ring russia with american puppet states
5176145 the neoconservative bush regime used the ned to intervene in ukrainian and georgian internal affairs in keeping with the neoconservative plan to establish us friendly and russia hostile political regimes in these two former constituent parts of russia and the soviet union
5176146 during the late 1970s there was new thinking at the highest levels of the u s foreign policymakers and they reconsidered whether these ugly murderous military dictatorships of the 1970s were really the best way to preserve u s interests in these countries
5176147 this new thinking led to the establishment in 1983 of the national endowment for democracy
5176148 a lot of what we ned do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the cia

5176162 outflows of foreign currency from russia were 6 billion on friday august 8 and 1 billion on monday august 11
5176163 i think the inflows will be a bit less than the official central bank forecast because of continued turbulence on global financial markets and some political risks which have appeared in recent days and have influenced foreigners views on capital input or withdrawal
5176164 fresh weakness in the european economic data and the easing inflation threat given the sharp fall in oil prices had the market shifting its focus to growth from inflation in recent weeks
5176165 this has helped the us dollar not due to any strong us macroeconomic data but more due to the incremental weakness in the other major economies
5176166 markets are sensing that global demand is weakening and that economies outside the us are bearing the brunt of this weakness even emerging markets growth which showed remarkable resilience in the h1 is at risk of falling below trend
5176167 we continue to position for the intensification of growth weakness outside the us through the currency markets

5176184 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5176185 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5176186 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5176187 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5176188 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5176189 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5176190 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5176191 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5176192 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5176193 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5176194 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5176195 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5176196 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5176197 the most thoroughly naturalistic that can be imagined and far more atheistic than that of his predecessor lamarck
5176198 it has been planned by the creator like the design of a watch evinces a watchmaker
5176199 the denial of design in nature is actually the denial of god
5176200 we grant the principle of evolution but we regard it as only the method of divine intelligence
5176201 the wine in the miracle was not water because water had been used in the making of it nor is man a brute because the brute has made some contributions to its creation
5176202 biblical scholars and theological schools find that the scientific theory of evolution does not conflict with their interpretation of the origins of life found in biblical literature
5176203 evolutions assumptions are as much around us as the air we breathe and no more escapable at the same time theologys affirmations are being made as responsibly as ever in this sense both science and religion are here to stay and need to remain in a healthful tension of respect toward one another
5176204 whereas the principles and concepts of biological evolution are basic to understanding science we call upon science teachers and local school authorities in all states to demand quality textbooks that are based on modern scientific knowledge and that exclude scientific creationism
5176205 professional organization of trained scientists and interested laypersons who are firmly committed to scientific special creation
5176206 in the matter of the shape of heaven the sacred writers did not wish to teach men facts that could be of no avail for their salvation
5176207 wir hoffen sehr dass daniel reinhard dem die v gele gruppe viel zu verdanken hat den gesundheitlichen r ckschlag rasch berwinden wird
5176208 what do you care you have that ugly 80s looking recliner this is my couch
5176209 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5176210 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5176211 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5176212 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5176213 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5176214 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5176215 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5176216 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5176217 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5176218 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5176219 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5176220 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5176221 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5176222 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5176223 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5176224 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5176225 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
5176226 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5176227 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5176228 well i said beauty disadvantaged now beauty is in the eye of the beholder beauty can be a good set of teeth beauty is nice wavy hair beauty can be blue eyes or green eyes beauty is in the eye of the beholder and beauty is only skin deep
5176229 there is such a thing as disposition temperament manners general attractiveness attitude and demeanour all those things tend to make a person attractive
5176230 when i came here it was only a small town and ive seen it grow and people come and go and the old timers have passed
5176231 the people that are coming into town now are coming here to work and find a house and live and bring up their families but with these sort of comments id say humph fancy going up to that place
5176232 the fact that he is actually returning us to the dark ages and making the guys that live in this town seem like sex hungry starved men that will pounce upon the first girl that they see walking down the street
5176233 anyone who moves to mount isa beautiful or not so beautiful they have a great chance to make a great life here it is a fantastic town there is certainly no problem
5176234 if guys have the right attitude then you know any type of girl will be happy to be with them so maybe the guys need to fix their attitudes a little bit
5176235 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5176236 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5176237 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5176238 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5176239 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5176240 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5176241 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5176242 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5176243 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5176244 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5176245 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5176246 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5176247 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5176248 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5176249 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5176250 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5176251 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5176252 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5176253 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5176254 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5176255 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5176256 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5176257 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5176258 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5176259 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5176260 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

5176263 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

5176273 it was a very tough encounter and it was great to be there and to witness it live because there were some good lessons for us both teams had huge intensity and being there in that arena and observing it made it very evident that any side that enters a tri nations fixture without being at full throttle will get hammered
5176274 that first half especially was extremely physical and when you are sitting in the stands it looks very tough out there but you would expect that level of physicality from the springboks and when our guys get out there on saturday they will enjoy the physical exchanges if they didnt like that side of the game they would not be here
5176275 there were times when the all blacks survived on defence and i dont think there is another team in the world that could absorb that amount of pressure there were occasions when it seemed inevitable that the boks would score but the all blacks hung in
5176276 that was the difference really those three tries were well taken
5176277 the idea of video conference and other remotely powered events proffer sustainability advantages such as reducing travel and time out of the office for delegates however the greatest fear has been that events of this style would lose the benefits of sharing ideas opinions and feedback this can now be successfully overcome with specialist engagement software
5176278 delegates can ask questions at any time via the software and participate in interactive sessions in just the same way they would on site this has been an exciting and pioneering development for the industry
5176279 this conference broke new ground for the national school and we were delighted at the success of the event
5176280 apparently the group in nottingham enjoyed it so much they carried on even after everyone in london had left
5176281 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5176282 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5176283 ele estava treinando muito bem at o ltimo s bado mas quando chegou vila ol mpica come ou a sentir fortes dores no calcanhar direito ele foi avaliado pelos m dicos e sab amos que o problema era s rio n o quer amos falar que ele n o iria competir n o pod amos falar sobre isso se n o tiv ssemos certeza t nhamos a esperan a que ele conseguisse
5176284 algumas not cias em chin s foram publicadas dando conta da les o desde maio muitos sabem que ele teve problemas musculares mas se recuperou em menos de dois meses estava treinando normalmente estava em sua melhor forma mas no ltimo s bado infelizmente ele sentiu dores muito fortes foi examinado e tratado pelos m dicos mas n o t nhamos certeza se ele realmente n o poderia competir
5176285 claro que todos esperavam que ele repetisse o que fez em atenas e conquistasse o ouro esse era o desejo de todo os chineses mas sei que sites da internet fizeram pesquisas sobre qual seria a rea o dos chineses se ele n o fosse campe o ol mpico e mais de 60 disseram que entenderiam
5176286 eu tenho certeza de que ele s iria desistir das olimp adas caso realmente n o conseguisse pisar no ch o
5176287 n o sabemos onde foi que ele se contundiu mas um problema que enfrentamos h seis ou sete anos foi algo que o incomodou antes de 2004 e que tem ido e vindo desde ent o chegamos vila ol mpica ele sentiu a les o novamente e fez todos os exames necess rios inclusive uma resson ncia magn tica
5176288 sign in one of the stores there i just shook my head and smiled comments rss
5176289 our quarterly economic forecast highlights a significant worsening in uk economic prospects there is now a distinct possibility of technical recession the level of uk unemployment is likely to increase to nearly 300 000 over the next few years reaching almost two million an increase above two million cannot be ruled out
5176290 our view is that the threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation
5176291 the uk economy urgently needs an interest rate cut to counter threats of recession
5176292 whilst a marked slowdown in activity is likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut when inflation peaks the correct policy decisions are still needed to ward off the threats of a serious and prolonged recession the longer the mpc waits before cutting rates the bigger the danger that the economic situation would deteriorate
5176293 londoners have so far been largely insulated from the price falls taking place elsewhere in the country
5176294 however sellers who choose to come to the market during the peak holiday season generally have a greater need to sell and as a result properties coming onto the market in july were on average 21 000 cheaper than last month
5176295 areas that are about to benefit from improved transport links appear to be avoiding the worst of the storm that is setting in elsewhere in the capital
5176296 when looking at trends in the market it is important to remember that uk house prices are significantly higher than five years ago

5176319 this is an issue that is not on the table
5176320 we want stability in the country we want political stability
5176321 i want to say what a fantastic day this is for me today
5176322 after the injury in barcelona i have not had the opportunity to go quick due to my condition but all the people around me including the whole team and suzuki stayed really close to me and gave me great support so i am really happy to pay them back with this podium it actually feels more like a win for me because it means so much
5176323 after the break following laguna i was able to get some rest and start training again to get myself back in the best condition and although i am still not 100 i am nearly there and i was able to challenge all weekend
5176324 my dream this weekend was to fight for a podium after friday i felt i could do that and today i started with a good focus to do my best this result is for all the team and everybody working with me because when we make a great result i am really happy and today i am certainly really happy
5176325 since germany we have improved a lot also thanks to the new technical material received by ducati i also thought i could have done a podium in laguna seca but i committed a mistake and i couldnt make it today everything went in the right direction i am sure that we can maintain the same level for the rest of the season
5176326 today we recognise the service of lance corporal john gillespie a husband a father a grandfather a mate

5176329 im just feeling that its not closure i dont use that word closure
5176330 i feel an end of a journey and i feel that for the gillespie family for johns sisters and brothers that its just most important that we have finally come to this stage to say that weve finally got him home
5176331 we worked together and look what it achieved weve got him home as the words on the plaque say home at last
5176332 a lot of the ceremonies are very difficult for us but when we have time to reflect and actually come back when its quiet weve got special places to go and remember him
5176333 why do you keep asking me the same question again and again although i have told you so many times it is a crow are you not able to understand this
5176334 today my little son aged three was sitting with me on the sofa when a crow was sitting on the window my son asked me 23 times what it was and i replied to him all 23 times that it was a crow i hugged him lovingly each time h e asked me the same question again and again for 23 times i did not at all feel irritated i rather felt affection for my innocent child
5176335 i want to see my parents happy forever they have cared for me ever since i was a little child they have always showered their selfless love on me they crossed all mountains and valleys without seeing the storm and heat to make me a person presentable in the society today
5176336 as christians i challenge you have a great aim have a great standard make jesus your ideal make him an ideal not merely to be admired but also to be followed
5176337 try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value
5176338 one desire has been the ruling passion of my life one high motive has acted like a spur upon my mind and soul and sooner should i seek escape from the sacred necessity that is laid upon me let the breath of life fail me it is this that in spite of all worldly opposition gods holy ordinances shall be established again in the home in the school and in the state for the good of the people to carve as it were into the conscience of the nation the ordinances of the lord to which the bible and creation bear witness until the nation pays homage again to god

5176589 it appears that several milf sub commanders are not controlled by the milf leadership but just using the peace process as the blanket to launch violent attacks against the people of mindanao
5176590 the recent milf perpetuated incidents in mindanao starting with the ambush of army troops of the 5th infantry battalion by the milf troops in lanao del sur yesterday is virtual declaration of war against the duly constituted authority
5176591 these developments are clear manifestation of insincerity to the peace process of the significant portion of the milf we have launched military operations in mindanao and this will go on until perpetrators are punished and normalcy is established in the area
5176592 we are confident that our troops in the ground will continue their mandate particularly protecting the people and making sure that the rule of law prevails
5176593 these are some of the incidents that happened immediately prior to the lanao attacks these are clear indications of the hostile acts they have committed against our troops it only shows some of the insincerity on the part of these milf commanders
5176594 but if there is a need if there are blatant violations or incursions in other areas then much as we would like to preserve the peace process your armed forces will have to take appropriate actions justifiable actions and the use of proportionate force
5176595 we are trying to reach him since morning but we failed to reach him apparently the two numbers are not working since this monday morning
5176596 our leadership has not sanctioned these attacks this has to stop if we can confirm the involvement of our forces
5176597 we cannot make any commitment right now until such time that we were able to determine the real cause of the situation
5176598 hopefully this does not mean that the younger people have given up on negotiations being done by the elders and have chosen to take things in their own hands because of this temporary restraining order on the memorandum of agreement issued by the supreme court

5176605 after the workshop with andrea i had a great proposal that was ready to present to agents she found ways to bring out the best in my own ideas even when i didnt see them clearly myself and to show me how to turn them into a well packaged proposal the first publisher who received it immediately expressed interest
5176606 i took andrea campbells on line course in fall 2005 because book proposals were so mystifying to me having worked as a freelance magazine writer for almost 20 years i certainly knew how to write a magazine query but the book proposal seemed like a whole other art form and it is andrea explained the different elements clearly part business plan part summary part writing showcase part voodoo and helped me master this strange concoction she was tough and demanding because she said agents and editors would be she was right the proposal i crafted with andreas help and insight earned me a top agent and a nice book contract with broadway books a doubleday imprint she also told us that if we crafted a good proposal writing the book would be so much easier she was right there too after i got my contract i wrote my memoir in only five months since i had a very specific and well thought out guideline my book the unlikely lavender queen a memoir of surprise blossoming i even came up with the title in her class will be out in may 2008
5176607 although id written and edited several books i really didnt understand what it takes to create a killer book proposal until i took andrea campbells course she manages to make a thoroughly intimidating process almost easy with an engaging style and tireless commitment to her students
5176608 no amount of time spent reading books and magazine articles about writing will duplicate what you can learn from andreas one on one personal feedback she offers candid professional and truthful advice about your work if your writing doesnt improve youre not paying attention

5176668 did you in any way say anything vulgar rude or offensive
5176669 you know of all the people here youve got the biggest mouth among all of us but you didnt curse or call her names nothing everything you said was complimentary right
5176670 uh i did equate her to a fat ugly radio show personality and a 1 900 sex operator
5176671 you only said she could look like that but you said there is no way that she actually does look like that

5176674 oh good sarah i need to ask you a favor i need you to delete the last voicemail i left for you it will probably be the most recent one in your mailbox
5176675 sarah this is extremely difficult to say my friend alex and i just called a few minutes ago to set up travel plans to canada you werent there so we left you a voicemail i thought i hung up the receiver we used the speaker phone when i finished
5176676 sarah i assure you that i said nothing rude or obnoxious
5176677 well sarah weve never met but ive spoken to you on the phone 3 or 4 times a year for the past 5 years anyway all of the folks that i work with have agreed that you have a beautiful voice
5176678 so after i thought i hung up the phone my coworkers and i proceeded to have a discussion about your voice not only that but based on your voice we speculated on what you looked like
5176679 listen sarah we both know youre not going to delete that voicemail if i were in your position there is no way i would delete it without listening to it first i just want you to know that i meant nothing but respect and admiration for you

5176697 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5176698 we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward and again that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5176699 russia currently is not in compliance with that cease fire
5176700 i dont have an explanation because i would think that when the russian president says that a signed cease fire accord will mean the withdrawal of russian forces that russian forces would then withdraw they did not however yet again the russian president has given his word and this time i hope hell honor it
5176701 clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
5176702 i think we had seen them more as partners and there had been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to flow to stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward the steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister in recent weeks and now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion bespeak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else
5176703 this looks frankly to me more like decisions made by the prime minister than by the president
5176704 if russia thought it was going to be able to bring down the georgia state bring down the democratic institutions it has failed
5176705 what theyve done instead is to bring down russias reputation as a potential and i want to emphasize potential partner in the international system
5176706 no one should try and force them back into a full relationship with georgia
5176707 if the russians intended this as intimidation they have done nothing but harden the attitudes of the small states around them
5176708 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5176709 it strikes me as pretty strident rhetoric and probably fairly empty rhetoric

5176726 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission

5176729 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5176730 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5176731 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

5176733 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5176734 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5176735 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5176736 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5176737 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5176738 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5176739 who are open to doing something on the production side
5176740 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5176741 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5176742 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5176743 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5176744 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5176745 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5176746 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5176747 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5176748 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5176749 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5176750 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5176751 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5176752 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5176753 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

5176756 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5176757 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5176758 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5176759 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5176760 no words can express my feelings today all i can say is that i will keep my rakhi promise and do whatever i can for these little ones and smitaji i cherish this rakhi very much
5176761 i make it a point to spend my free time with the children but today i felt they should enjoy festivities as well and i am happy a veteran like bappida and shweta pandit gave some of their valuable time for this cause

5176774 its not the best time to be putting ipos on the market these days
5176775 i think the whole focus on water and the environment thats going to offer we think big opportunities for us as time goes on
5176776 it impacts us but i think weve kind of managed our way through it pretty well we havent had any big write offs
5176777 some of the best opportunities weve seen in the last 10 years were seeing right now assets are cheap
5176778 in financial services sometimes bad news is good news youll see some great deals done in this cycle and well do some of them

5176780 ge has 12 100 employees in china and one of its four global research and development centers is in shanghai the others are in the united states germany and india
5176781 this is a great way to expand into the united states our base case is to do a spin to investors but i think the appliance business makes sense to a lot of people out there
5176782 but ge has no plans sell its nbc universal media unit immelt said despite pressure from some investors to jettison a business that they say has little connection to the industrial and financial conglomerates other activities
5176783 i always say look its a good business we run it well
5176784 if a show is good and gets good ratings i dont mind if they poke fun at their parent every now and then
5176785 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5176786 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5176787 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5176788 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5176789 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5176790 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5176791 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5176792 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5176793 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5176794 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5176795 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5176796 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5176797 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5176798 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5176799 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5176800 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5176801 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5176802 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5176803 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5176804 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5176805 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5176806 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5176807 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5176808 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5176809 dazu kommen noch ber 13 000 wienerinnen die landespflegegeld beziehen

5176811 gerade f r diese gruppen war die erh hung des pflegegeldes und die bessere einstufung unbedingt notwendig

5176814 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5176815 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5176816 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5176817 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5176818 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5176819 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5176820 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5176821 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5176822 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5176823 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5176824 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5176825 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5176826 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5176827 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5176828 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5176829 i found out about it halfway through the day session last night when i went over there to see what was going on
5176830 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5176831 but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5176832 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5176833 you look at the no 32 car of brian vickers and red bull racing the 32 and the 18 and the 20 made about the same power the first run on the dyno when they took the magnet or whatever this device was out of the 18 and the 20 they both came up
5176834 what i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on because a lot of whats been done by nascar has been based on the chassis dyno results
5176835 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that
5176836 if theyre going to make decisions based on parity after theyve given toyota what theyve given them with regard to parameters on their engine based on flawed data that a team or the manufacturer one of the other had kited or shaved that certainly is detrimental to my interests

5176880 thats not surprising since benjamin black is really john banville the irish writer who won the 2005 man booker prize

5176885 they will be reminded throughout this week it will be in the news about this defeat their critics will be onto them relentlessly
5176886 but i have no doubt they will be up for it next week in durban after durban it will be johannesburg and thats been a happy hunting ground for them
5176887 you must not forget that australia also have great pressure of their own
5176888 they have not won in south africa for some time so they also want to get that monkey off their back i have no doubt that the boks will be up and ready next week when they come up against australia
5176889 it was hard for us watching knowing that there is no way thats going to happen again next week
5176890 south africa are world champions and theyre an extremely proud rugby nation and to not score a point will just reinforce their resolve in durban this saturday
5176891 south africa get tremendous support and usually grow an extra leg at home and more often than not rise to the occasion ive been involved in some narrow losses here which has been very frustrating
5176892 i dont think the boks performed that badly against the all blacks
5176893 i think he may have wanted to win too much and could have caved under the pressure

5176900 we worked hard every day but the result was as you see and its really hard to take
5176901 in watching warmups we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5176902 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5176903 a 110 meter hurdles race without liu is such a pity
5176904 but they will understand when somebody has an accident you cant help it
5176905 without a doubt the springboks wont want to suffer again at home
5176906 its hard for the springboks now to win the tournament but hence their likely response as a result of saturday
5176907 they are world champions and there is no way they will be excited about contemplating another loss you cant hide it will be a great opportunity coming at the end of the week it will only be what we make of it
5176908 it was great to be there it was great to be able to witness it live the score appears to be one sided but the contest itself was very much anything but that
5176909 and the first half was probably the biggest indicator of that there was an awful amount of rugby played in that first half but there was very little to show for it it was 5 0 on the scoreboard at half time
5176910 the all blacks got home and they played well they absorbed the pressure and there was a significant amount of pressure from the boks
5176911 they absorbed that and took the points not always by the boot but they were able to score three tries and that was the difference
5176912 there were times they survived on defence when there was probably no other side in the world that would have because the boks did bring a lot of pressure to bear and it looked on occasions like scoring was inevitable but they hung in there and they defended very well

5176928 helmets do save lives and theyre known to reduce head injuries

5176930 just like any other helmet a snow helmet spreads the force over a greater area of the head
5176931 some are quite high tech and comfortable and theyre convenient because theyre warm

5176940 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5176941 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5176942 this is a planning took where all things are going
5176943 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5176944 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5176945 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5176946 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5176947 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5176948 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5176949 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5176950 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5176951 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5176952 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5176953 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5176954 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5176955 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5176956 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5176957 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5176958 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5176959 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5176960 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5176961 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5176962 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5176963 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5176964 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5176965 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5176966 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5176967 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it

5176970 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5176971 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5176972 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5176973 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5176974 president musharraf has made up his mind to resign before the impeachment motion is tabled in the assembly
5176975 president musharraf has agreed to resign on the condition that he would be given indemnity and would not be tried sources said and added that musharrafs address to the nation was a part of that understanding
5176976 afghanistan has to try to have good relations with you but if your government continues a reversed policy the afghans will be obliged to kill your nationals in revenge for their brothers their sisters and their children events such as logar will happen again because occupied afghanistan looks at all actors that are established in the interest of america with an eye of hostility
5176977 therefore you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans
5176978 we know that the taliban will use any means to further their terrorist goals i expect the government of canada to do everything to protect the brave civilians who are doing all they can to help the afghan people
5176979 this letter is a disgusting attempt to justify the deliberate killings of innocent civilians there is no justification for these killings by the taliban

5176999 la presentaci n de cellvivance es el segundo acontecimiento m s importante para la corporaci n despu s del cambio del nombre de ebel a lbel y con l se pretende reforzar la filosof a de marca a trav s de su eslogan el poder de ser mujer las iniciativas de comunicaci n comercial para posicionar el producto tendr n una duraci n de dos meses y puede ser que se prolongue uno m s
5177000 monterrey es una regi n en la cual vamos a invertir tres millones de pesos en activaciones como la impartici n de talleres de imagen y spas boutique dirigidos a diversas instituciones y oficinas el otro aspecto que se pretende explotar m s es el uso de internet como punto de contacto con nuestras consumidoras
5177001 el porcentaje de la compa a respecto a las otras empresas del mismo segmento es de seis por ciento pero hay que considerar que lbel es la marca con mayor prestigio de este sector la cual corresponde a un target de mujeres de 30 a 50 a os de un nivel socioecon mico nse b y c el objetivo consiste en que existan m s consultoras y del tal forma se pueda llegar a un mayor rango de consumidoras
5177002 actualmente la tv no se lleva m s del 50 por ciento de la inversi n publicitaria puede decirse mucho en internet pero en el caso de cellvivance las revistas son el medio id neo para posicionar el producto porque la comunicaci n se enfoca en los beneficios y calidad del mismo
5177003 a lo largo de 15 a os la principal t ctica de comunicaci n son las relaciones p blicas adem s del contacto directo con las consumidoras que su vez compartir n su experiencias con otras personas
5177004 en estados unidos curves cuenta con un presupuesto de 20 millones de d lares destinados para las actividades publicitarias que han sido desarrolladas por publicis por otra parte mantenemos alianzas con compa as como general mills y avon por su relaci n con el target de la franquicia
5177005 por el momento curves no existe un monto espec fico para publicidad pero se han realizado acuerdos e intercambios con empresas como splenda nutrissa gatorade por ser marcas que se interesan en el mercado de la compa a y as crear una relaci n ganar ganar entre las diversas entidades sin embargo la comunicaci n empleada de forma interna en los centros de entrenamiento proviene de estados unidos por lo que se lleva acabo un proceso de adaptaci n tropicalizaci n debido a las diferencias culturales

5177007 i just cant enjoy the muppets anymore because after i saw toy story i realized the only thing wanted to see again was cgi
5177008 if mere words could from a book could move you why cant 8 bit pixels
5177009 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5177010 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5177011 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5177012 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5177013 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5177014 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5177015 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5177016 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5177017 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5177018 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5177019 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5177020 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5177021 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5177022 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5177023 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5177024 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5177025 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5177026 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5177027 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5177028 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5177029 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5177030 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5177031 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5177032 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5177033 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5177034 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5177035 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5177036 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5177037 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5177038 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5177039 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5177040 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5177041 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5177042 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5177043 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5177044 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5177045 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5177046 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5177047 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5177048 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5177049 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5177050 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5177051 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5177052 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5177053 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5177054 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5177055 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5177056 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5177057 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5177058 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5177059 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5177060 healing hands of god have mercy on our unclean souls once again jesus christ light of the world burning bright within our hearts forever freedom means love without condition without a beginning or an end heres my heart let it be forever yours only you can make every new day seem so new
5177061 what can i possibly do with 4 month of time off from school
5177062 we discovered that it was ok to have a little high brow as long you have a lot of low brow thats entertainment value the one thing you want to avoid is the middle brow because the whole world is frigging middle brow at the moment
5177063 i was very aggressive throwing the first pitch for strikes
5177064 that allowed me to go out there for the ninth i was just doing my job
5177065 he was adamant about going back out there which is always a good thing
5177066 were executing for the most part in different facets of the game those are still things you must do no matter who youre playing these are games you would like to win but its baseball so you never know
5177067 hitting in front of johan i didnt think i would get too many chances
5177068 were going to try to work through it with him

5177071 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5177072 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5177073 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5177074 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5177075 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5177076 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5177077 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5177078 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5177079 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5177080 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5177081 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5177082 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5177083 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5177084 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5177085 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5177086 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5177087 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5177088 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5177089 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5177090 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5177091 did they repeat the order back to you after you ordered
5177092 well you really need to pay attention when they read it back to you to make sure it is accurate
5177093 you just really have to pay attention and make sure it sounds right
5177094 we have copied nature taking the elements and mechanisms found in plant life that have evolved over 3 billion years and recreated one of those processes in the laboratory
5177095 the breakthrough came when we coated a proton conductor called nafion onto an anode to form a polymer membrane just a few micrometres thick which acts as a host for the manganese clusters
5177096 normally insoluble in water when we bound the catalyst within the pores of the nafion membrane it was stabilised against decomposition and importantly water could reach the catalyst where it was oxidized on exposure to light
5177097 whilst man has been able to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for years we have been able to do the same thing for the first time using just sunlight an electrical potential of 1 2 volts and the very chemical that nature has selected for this purpose
5177098 we need to continue to learn from nature so that we can better master this process
5177099 the two new cyber shot phones that we have announced today share certain characteristics both phones place ease of use and best in class picture quality at the heart of their designs
5177100 yet both appeal to different audiences one is engineered to let you take more pictures in more places and the other is designed to look as stunning as the pictures it takes
5177101 it will change it will it did with every girl you ever loved before my existence in your life and there is another girl out there who when you find her will erase me from your memory thats how it works and youll swear that you lover her more then any other girl youve ever been with that shes the only one youve ever loved that you thought you were in love before but you didnt know what love really was until you met her thats what happens with everybody nobody knows what love really is we only know what we feel in a moment and how that moment compares to past moments that at that particular time have faded slightly and dont seem to hold a flame to how you presently feel that is why the past is history the futures a mystery but now is a gift thats why thy call it the present
5177102 there were no footprints where we were going and i only saw the slightest evidence of human use
5177103 much to my surprise as we moved about halfway through this passage my foot completely sunk into the soil
5177104 it was mud there was a lot of it it was all contained within the salt stream flow that meandered through this passage
5177105 in arguably the driest desert in the world weve found water in a cave far away from any known water source
5177106 essentially we found water in a barren area below the earths surface why was water there what are the mechanisms for the presence of water in these hyper arid caves is this merely a phenomenon related to these caves in particular is there some sort of moisture sink that results in the water concentrating in certain caves and not others in the atacama desert
5177107 we found hundreds of thousands of bones and skulls eroding out of the cave walls
5177108 so weve renamed this small cave cuevita de huesos or small cave of the bones
5177109 this is where we found all the bones mixed in with tree branches
5177110 whatever the mechanism for their deposition this find was incredibly cool and rather exhilarating
5177111 our overall goal is to define mission and instrumentation requirements for detecting caves on mars using thermal infrared imagery
5177112 martian caves have already been detected through techniques developed by this project and are significant as a potential habitat for microorganisms and other extremophiles that might exist or have existed on mars
5177113 they may also serve as future habitats for astronaut explorers to the red planet as they offer protection from radiation and the harsh environment of the surface
5177114 ive seen what may be the best futuristic anthology series since the glory days of the twilight zone and the outer limits
5177115 aliens controlling the fbi was willing to let him rot despite every indication during seasons 8 and 9 that this was not their position
5177116 do you believe man or me do you believe i am going to be with her every step of the way have i ever turned my back on you or your family
5177117 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5177118 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5177119 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5177120 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional

5177157 you are dealing with a fundamental constitutional change to the way we deal with fraud in new zealand at a time when finance companies are falling over at an alarming rate its just irresponsible of the government to try to force legislation like this through the house right before an election
5177158 there are grounds to suspect a culture of political cowardice at very senior police levels if there is not cowardice there is certainly political correctness that is a soft form of corruption or favouritism ask the woman whose court order was ignored by the police who watched her husbands stolen body being buried in breach of the order among other more sinister examples is the never explained police failure to pursue labours electoral frauds i do not trust police hq they unapologetically gave recklessly or deliberately untrue written answers to some of my parliamentary questions parliament will find it much harder in future after subordination of the sfo to the police to demand accountability for pursuing white collar crime police are rarely called upon to report to the opposition in parliament on the conduct of individual cases the way the sfo has had to account statutory independence allows the nz police immunity from pursuit of decisions to prosecute or not to prosecute even if there is widespread anxiety about corruption we should not be concentrating all the nations investigative resources and expertise in one organisation it would be insurance to keep an alternative centre that could be beefed up if a septic element in the police culture can not be eradicated there is a constitutional problem too the sfo has been given extraordinary powers and exemptions from normal rules that protect liberties from abuse of police powers e g search and seizure the power to compel evidence from people with no culpability some more offensive powers are in the criminal proceeds bill when the sfo is rolled into the police it will be impossible to sequester those exceptions no one will want to vote to remove them anti fraud laws have been misused overseas the us rico racketeering and corrupt organisations law has been used now in areas remote from what the legislators would have expected

5177216 president medvedev kondigde aan dat de troepen vanaf morgen maandag 18 augustus overdag zouden beginnen met terugtrekken
5177217 it is without question the best weekend britain has had at an olympics
5177218 and it is testament to how far we have come in improving our levels of performance perhaps the key to it is the support we can give our athletes now and 1996 played a key part in that change
5177219 for the last three years all anybody has been talking about has been london london london
5177220 that has focussed minds the boa has stepped up the government has increased its support and the many of the sports have raised their games too
5177221 it is not just a case of home advantage its what theyve been doing in preparation for the last seven years in their case longer as they thought they were going to get the 2000 games
5177222 show that stretch wont be quite so uncomfortable and moynihan is adamant the good times arent quite over yet in china sailing regatta has a long way to go there are still medals to be won in the cycling and were confident of success in lots of other sports too its by no means over
5177223 our athletes coaches and support staff should be proud of their achievements
5177224 at the start of the games one of our ambitions was to achieve around
5177225 we still have another week of great sport to look forward to then we can start to think about how we can build on beijing towards london 2012 and beyond

5177245 we made a bit of a mistake at the beginning

5177257 he would not have withdrawn unless the pain was intolerable
5177258 i am extremely disappointed and i think he may have wanted to win too much and could have caved under the pressure
5177259 its part of the natural ability of jamaicans i dont know maybe its in the water
5177260 luckily i was in the stairway when the explosion hit but they didnt make it
5177261 if there are any georgians here come out and we will take you to safety
5177262 my family doesnt even know if i am dead or alive
5177263 i was watching my house burn and a russian soldier put his gun on me and said dont look just go away my dog barked and an ossetian shot him so i got on the bus
5177264 sure we dont have much and some are very hungry but its not so bad that people should act like this
5177265 i am exhausted but this is my profession i have no right to be soft
5177266 i never thought i would have to ask russians whether or not i could enter or leave my city now i ask them every day when they will leave and every day they go nowhere
5177267 the historical data tell us clearly dont get too used to commodity export booms as any third world country will tell you they tend to go away pretty quickly
5177268 is that we have been able to greatly increase corn exports while also using it for ethanol only by increasing the acreage devoted to corn have we been able to do this and by squeezing down the use of corn for domestic livestock feed
5177269 we have achieved a worldwide manufacturing base and we are not going to shut down our factories overseas
5177270 but on the margin we will shift a little bit of manufacturing back to the united states
5177271 which means we are looking to set up shop there
5177272 we were in a situation where there wasnt enough corn in the world to go around
5177273 it is my fondest hope that exports will stay strong
5177274 although i dont think it is realistic to expect a percentage increase equal to what we are seeing this year
5177275 we have a supply chain that facilitates entry into new markets
5177276 locating abroad puts us on an equal footing with domestic suppliers
5177277 our customers just love for us to make our stuff near their new operations
5177278 and if we do they reward us with a lot of business
5177279 most of the money we make overseas we keep there
5177280 and then plow it back into growing the business overseas
5177281 we have a tremendous capacity to grow corn and other crops in this country
5177282 if you dont have gas you cant get to work
5177283 and if you cant get to work you dont get paid and if you dont get paid you cant buy food were at their mercy
5177284 i dont know if its the gas prices and i dont know if its the grocery prices but its been through the summer
5177285 we cover 17 000 square miles in south central idaho its a lot of ground to cover
5177286 without that i wouldnt have been able to afford to go to school
5177287 it doesnt matter what the economists say all the people i chat with at the grocery store the gas station shopping for school clothes all are feeling very depressed because of the beating their budgets are taking
5177288 the marketplace works people can figure out if they should drive more or less its a little presumptuous on my part to dictate how consumers live their own lives
5177289 t he issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should

5177306 die polizisten stellten immer wieder fest dass die autofahrer zum schuljahresbeginn zu wenig r cksicht zeigen

5177319 its like asking an audience what album they want to hear they dont know until they hear it
5177320 we need to collect evidence before we go to court and were not saying were going to court tomorrow but at least with the new law microsoft has to be more careful
5177321 the uptake of office is at the lowest its been in the last couple of years so while nothings put a dent in the armor at this point perhaps there is some crumbling and the opportunity for a lower priced offering to make some inroads
5177322 given its capabilities theres no indication why it wouldnt be seen as an alternative to microsoft
5177323 this is the equivalent to forcing china to pirate the product
5177324 to try and level the playing filed between western products and native products
5177325 they are understandably not happy about foreign companies owning the bulk of the software sales in their own market
5177326 local software products of any kind pay off for microsoft
5177327 once a country has its own software businesses that countrys political leaders will start to get serious about stopping piracy so microsoft might well root for evermore
5177328 the asian market represents a wealth of opportunities but i guess the bigger issue is are people going to pay for software
5177329 microsoft of course still has the lions share of the market
5177330 we dont want to compete with that for media coverage
5177331 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5177332 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5177333 oh my this is very confusing no wonder the government says its too early to take action
5177334 to ensure our national security economic prosperity and clean environment by breaking our dependence on foreign oil
5177335 the hands that install roofs can also install solar panels the hands that build todays cars can also build the next generation of fuel efficient vehicles barack obama will create 5 million jobs developing homegrown energy technologies
5177336 one of the most important ways of positioning on global warming is to emphasize the jobs issue since it appeals to people who you might not otherwise reach with your message
5177337 on the big issues that our nation faces some sacrifice will be required not only from you individually but from the nation as a whole there is no magic bullet to our energy problems for example no perfect energy source
5177338 the call to sacrifice for the nations greater good remains an imperative of citizenship sadly in recent years in the midst of a war on two fronts this call to service never came after 9 11 we were asked to shop
5177339 plenty of recent media polls demonstrate that drilling for more american oil particularly offshore drilling has the potential to be a very effective wedge issue for republicans as a way to reduce the price of gas
5177340 for the immediate short term right now forcing house democrats to vote on drilling offshore and in wilderness areas or exposing their refusal to hold this vote would be a potentially strong wedge issue that would split the democrats win among independents and excite the republicans
5177341 the republican echo chamber has done a great job on this
5177342 this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very future of our nation
5177343 the energy crisis is real it is worldwide it is a clear and present danger to our nation these are the facts and we must face them
5177344 thou shalt not talk honestly to the american people about sacrifice
5177345 the snows of africas mount kilimanjaro inspired the title of an iconic american short story but now its dwindling icecap is being cited as proof for human induced global warming
5177346 however two researchers writing in the july august edition of american scientist magazine say global warming has nothing to do with the decline of kilimanjaros ice and using the mountain in northern tanzania as a poster child for climate change is simply inaccurate
5177347 there are dozens if not hundreds of photos of midlatitude glaciers you could show where there is absolutely no question that they are declining in response to the warming atmosphere said climatologist philip mote a university of washington research scientist
5177348 but in the tropics particularly on kilimanjaro processes are at work that are far different from those that have diminished glacial ice in temperate regions closer to the poles he said
5177349 mote and georg kaser a glaciologist at the university of innsbruck in austria write in american scientist that the decline in kilimanjaros ice has been going on for more than a century and that most of it occurred before 1953 while evidence of atmospheric warming there before 1970 is inconclusive
5177350 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
5177351 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
5177352 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
5177353 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
5177354 my knowledge and my background told me that a few hundred marines in a situation like that could not successfully carry out any kind of peacekeeping mission and i thought they were going into harms way
5177355 the same old folks that brought you george w bush
5177356 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5177357 respectfully im going to disagree with you on mccain and his service
5177358 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5177359 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5177360 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment and they do have profound differences of opinion on the best way to reduce our dependence on mideast oil bring jobs back to america and keep our nation safe
5177361 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5177362 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5177363 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5177364 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5177365 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5177366 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5177367 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5177368 l felicit pe sichitiu pentru c l a dat afar pe mircea rednic
5177369 of course it is impossible to precisely predict when solar radiance will drop and global temperatures will begin falling but one thing is certain there is little evidence that mankind is responsible for global warming there is considerable evidence that the sun causes warming and will most likely stimulate cooling in the not so distant future
5177370 izrael was chairman of the state committee on hydrometeorology goskomgidromet at the time of the chernobyl nuclear accident following the accident he was widely criticized for slow and inaccurate monitoring he was also criticized for allowing air pollution throughout the ussr to reach unprecedented levels
5177371 all the scientific evidence seems to support the same general conclusions that the kyoto protocol is overly expensive ineffective and based on bad science
5177372 so many people have a vested interest in this global warming thing
5177373 how many times are you going to post this pointless nonsense i suppose as many times as is necessary to cover up the fact that you have no evidence
5177374 i realized i had become a sort of a guru about what one needs to do to make a house into a healthy home so i started allergybuyers com to sell helpful products to people like me
5177375 i have always been most interested in the green aspects of what we were doing at allergy buyers and that really goes back a very long way in my history
5177376 forty five years ago i had solar panels on my house in england my family were environmentalists before anybody ever really used the term
5177377 we have products that if people use them can actually make an impact on the world in a positive way its very exciting to conceive of a business where youre making a profit and a difference at the same time
5177378 we still focus on home products but the impact on the greater community is enormous
5177379 its amazing how something so simple can make such a difference and save so much money too
5177380 the kinds of things that ive been living my life around in my home environment suddenly became more interesting to the outside world
5177381 but its like wow its taken everyone 35 years to get it thats like half a lifetime
5177382 they are the biggest marketing ploy that has ever been hoisted on the american public they should be banned
5177383 they take a thousand years to degrade in a landfill buy a reusable water bottle its so simple to put a water filter on your tap if the water tastes bad
5177384 we like to choose products that make life better but also dont ask the consumer to do anything special or unique to help conserve electricity or water or you name it
5177385 most of our products if youre a lazy person are a no brainer
5177386 so if youre going to paint a room for 20 you could save a whole lot of money
5177387 a lot of companies turn to youtube to raise awareness of global concerns like renewable energy climate change or poverty now socially conscious businesses are following suit by leveraging their brands to showcase important issues and encourage people to get involved
5177388 its the companys opportunity to get into pretty personal communication and interaction with its own customers
5177389 they strengthen their brand by putting a face to things customers can hear and see them talk
5177390 the earthkeeper channel on youtube is one of several vehicles by which we seek to engage consumers in a dialogue around the environment and climate change
5177391 the reason we chose to sponsor a contest on youtube is because video is such a popular and powerful medium that allows consumers to explore very creative stimulating methods of communicating their messages
5177392 companies have an interest to be perceived as socially responsible but they want to sell their products at the same time
5177393 youtube is a new vehicle and companies are offering these types of media therefore the spots are not completely altruistic theres an element of both selling and doing good
5177394 he not only indicated the problem of climate change but he also set a new form of demonstration short clips brief presentations
5177395 no company can ignore the whole climate problem i have no doubt that the pr department of every company is telling their bosses we have to have a presence because its part of being in business today
5177396 she put him out like the burnin end of a midnight cigarette she broke his heart he spent his whole life tryin to forget we watched him drink his pain away a little at a time but he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind until the night 1st chorus he put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger and finally drank away her memory life is short but this time it was bigger than the strength he had to get up off his knees we found him with his face down in the pillow with a note that said ill love her till i die and when we buried him beneath the willow the angels sang a whiskey lullaby
5177397 when a bull whale comes at you with an erect penis its nine feet long
5177398 its like a torpedo and youd better get out of the way fast
5177399 he weighs between 15 and 18 tons youre basically the size of a piece of sushi to him the worst thing you can do is panic hell see your chest moving up and down and think to himself hey this guys afraid of me that means he must be lunch
5177400 every four years you usually get to look at these guys try to go native think of president bush in his brush clearing outfit
5177401 but if youre president the day job does involve a suit and it can be awkward when youre not in work clothes
5177402 everyone knows how fast a picture can go from local novelty to worldwide laughingstock
5177403 it shows hes not trying to be like everyone else its part of the visual message that hes crafting in an odd little way it adds to the not pandering in a conservative middle america suit like a 50 year old tax lawyer wears
5177404 it would be inappropriate if mccain looked as stylish as obama he has a different physique hes a different age and hes much more conservative
5177405 he does have occasional fun with a wider flashy tie
5177406 not all senators can wear that but it looks right on him
5177407 you could put baracks head on johns body and say hes gained a little weight but you wouldnt notice he was in different clothes
5177408 im not interested in a vice president who i send off to go to funerals
5177409 i want somebody who is going to roll up their sleeves and be willing to work
5177410 i am aware of the enhanced importance of this issue given my age
5177411 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5177412 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs

5177421 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
5177422 the democrats talk of tolerance but in reality the only tolerance they ever exhibit is for their own intellectual arrogance and they dont have tolerance for my culture
5177423 they think were a bunch of hillbilly heathens who go out and burn crosses and do crazy bullshit
5177424 they dont give a f if were with them or not because it doesnt matter the f ing republicans have stolen the individual liberties thing and thats why the gun thing is such a big deal

5177428 instead of all the high falutin exhortation about listening to the better angels mr obama has gotta come out here and time is short and emphasise social justice
5177429 he should say im a black guy im not gonna take the michael jackson treatment but the problems of south side chicago are the same problems of the appalachian mountains big sonsofabitches are kicking the little sonsofabitches in the ass now im one of the little sonsofabitches so im pissed off inside every rural republican is a rural democrat begging to get out but we always trip over our johnsons
5177430 think this election will be won on the internet but here at 5 30 in the afternoon they dont go on the goddamn internet they go watch the andy griffith show a 1960s sitcom
5177431 white people in the south and throughout the appalachians love black culture i mean southern style cooking is black food everything i eat is fried your swing vote in the appalachians comes down to common sense thinking people who have strong faith and what barack obama needs to do is embrace his culture because we like his culture but nobody knows anything about him over 10 per cent of the rednecks out here and im a redneck think hes a muslim cause nobodys ever told em any different

5177446 in a couple of hours we can turn something around its the ideas behind them not the money
5177447 what makes this such a fun election is that there is so much awareness its like when youre at the water cooler and everybody watched the same television show the night before people are just really ready to be engaged

5177460 obamas camp initially agreed that the cartoon was quote tasteless and offensive really you know what your response should have been its very easy here let me put the statement out for you barack obama is in no way upset about the cartoon that depicts him as a muslim extremist because you know who gets upset about cartoons muslim extremists

5177466 ralph nader in the news this week ralph nader announced that he is certified to be on the presidential ballot in 12 states however doctors say that nader is certifiable in all 50 states
5177467 barack obama still continuing to dominate media coverage the new york times just did a big piece they say that barack obama has been successful in politics because hes a black man who doesnt make white people feel threatened yeah yeah which explains obamas secret service code name al roker
5177468 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
5177469 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
5177470 reporters are grumbling more and more that the campaign is acting like the prom queen they gripe that it is arrogant and control ling and the campaigns own belief that obama is poised to make history isnt endearing either the press certainly helped obama get so far so fast the question is how far can he get if his campaign alienates them
5177471 end of the affair barack obama and the press break up
5177472 the problem is not that democrats are monolithically pro choice or anti school prayer its that by dropping the class language that once distinguished them sharply from republicans they have left themselves vulnerable to cultural wedge issues like guns and abortion and the rest whose hallucinatory appeal would ordinarily be overshadowed by material concerns we are in an environment where republicans talks constantly about class in a coded way to be sure but where democrats are afraid to bring it up

5177476 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5177477 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5177478 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5177479 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5177480 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5177481 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5177482 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5177483 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5177484 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5177485 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5177486 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5177487 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5177488 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5177489 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5177490 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify

5177509 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
5177510 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
5177511 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
5177512 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
5177513 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent

5177517 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
5177518 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
5177519 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower

5177523 the further down the street you went the badder it got
5177524 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5177525 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5177526 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5177527 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5177528 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5177529 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes

5177533 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5177534 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5177535 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5177536 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5177537 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5177538 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5177539 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5177540 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5177541 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5177542 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5177543 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5177544 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5177545 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5177546 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5177547 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5177548 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

5177551 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5177552 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5177553 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5177554 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5177555 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5177556 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5177557 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5177558 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5177559 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5177560 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5177561 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5177562 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
5177563 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
5177564 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
5177565 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
5177566 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
5177567 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5177568 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
5177569 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
5177570 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
5177571 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
5177572 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
5177573 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5177574 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5177575 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5177576 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5177577 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5177578 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5177579 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
5177580 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
5177581 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
5177582 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence

5177612 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5177613 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis

5177621 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
5177622 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
5177623 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
5177624 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
5177625 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
5177626 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
5177627 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5177628 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5177629 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5177630 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5177631 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5177632 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
5177633 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
5177634 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
5177635 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
5177636 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
5177637 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
5177638 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
5177639 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
5177640 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
5177641 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
5177642 what do we have to give up to reach the cost of a trillion and a half to three trillion dollars theres going to have to be some pain some sacrifice on the part of the american taxpayer isnt there
5177643 the real way to bring gasoline prices down is not by going back to try more of the same things that have not worked in the past but to say wait a minute now is the time for a really dramatic shift over to renewable energy
5177644 he did not force gore to debate a crackpot from cloud cuckoo land who is still waiting for the evidence to arrive about human sources of radical climate change
5177645 the unsupported assumption catastrophic global warming follows burning fossil fuels requires immediate action
5177646 the unsupported assumption that the world is more than 6000 years old
5177647 he did not force gore to debate a crackpot from cloud cuckoo land who is still waiting for the evidence to arrive about human sources of radical climate change
5177648 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5177649 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5177650 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5177651 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5177652 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5177653 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5177654 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5177655 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5177656 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5177657 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5177658 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5177659 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5177660 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5177661 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

5177665 i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
5177666 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5177667 we have in this country an overabundance of supply of health care services
5177668 so as we look to find ways to help stem the increase in cost associated with medical benefits we have to realize thats money coming out of revenue for a provider of care
5177669 the economic cost estimate to central new york for smoking is 763 million
5177670 individuals and society we can act on what we see in the mirror
5177671 you folks cant sustain that we cant as a community sustain that
5177672 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
5177673 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
5177674 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
5177675 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
5177676 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5177677 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
5177678 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
5177679 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5177680 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5177681 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5177682 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5177683 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5177684 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5177685 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5177686 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5177687 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5177688 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5177689 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5177690 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5177691 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5177692 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5177693 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5177694 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5177695 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5177696 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5177697 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5177698 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5177699 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5177700 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5177701 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5177702 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5177703 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5177704 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5177705 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5177706 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5177707 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5177708 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5177709 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5177710 tim wore his catholicism proudly he talked about it all the time
5177711 in fact russerts faith was not an elephant in the room it was the room it was the room he was raised in it was one of his great charms as was how he dealt with it in life and in our public discourse
5177712 catholicism was his base it was never his bias i think thats absolutely crucial and i will debate anyone who contends to the contrary
5177713 learnings from the political process for common ground in the catholic church
5177714 understood that the stakes were high he knew that better than most of us
5177715 he knew that the civility of our dialogue was under attack he knew that diversity in the public square takes work every day and he knew that our standards of journalism were being attacked
5177716 he understood what it meant to be called to be catholic and i think thats very important he took the call
5177717 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5177718 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5177719 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5177720 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5177721 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5177722 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5177723 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5177724 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5177725 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
5177726 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
5177727 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
5177728 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5177729 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5177730 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5177731 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5177732 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5177733 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5177734 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5177735 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5177736 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5177737 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5177738 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5177739 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5177740 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5177741 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
5177742 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5177743 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
5177744 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal

5177753 opposes the present us policy in iraq not on the basis of any principled opposition to neo colonialism or aggressive war but rather on the grounds that the iraq war is a mistaken deployment of power that fails to advance the global strategic interests of american imperialism
5177754 theres not that much difference between my position and george bushs position at this stage
5177755 nazis soviets in their gulags or some mad regime pol pot or others that had no concern for human beings
5177756 he would return the country to the more traditional foreign policy efforts of past presidents such as george h
5177757 these days an appreciable number of obama supporters are starting to use words like disillusionment but thats a consequence of projecting their political outlooks onto the candidate in the first place the best way to avoid becoming disillusioned is to not have illusions in the first place

5177760 not only a requirement of law it is a requirement of justice to the victims and of deterrence to powerful countries such as those in nato who in their military might and in their control over the media are lacking in any other natural restraint such as might deter less powerful countries
5177761 by holding individuals accountable regardless of their position the ictys work has dismantled the tradition of impunity for war crimes and other serious violations of international law particularly by individuals who held the most senior positions

5177841 esto puede estorbar mucho para ir a la divina uni n porque aparta mucho al alma si hace caso de ello del abismo de la fe en que el entendimiento ha de estar oscuro y oscuro ha de ir por amor en fe y no por mucha raz n

5177870 its a lot harder winning the mens open title this is the biggest tournament in town by far and i really just wanted to play in it
5177871 i just did everything well i putted real well and only made one double on no 7 i didnt know what anybody else had but i figured somebody else would have to shoot really low to beat me because cole was the only one close going into sunday
5177872 i hit a good drive down the middle and then hit a seven iron probably four feet away
5177873 ive made an eagle on that hole before but it was never that close
5177874 its easy playing on your home course and i didnt really hold back i pretty much went at every hole and tried to hit every par 5 in two
5177875 if i had to lose to anybody i thought it would be blair hes been playing good and it would be nice to see him get a scholarship somewhere
5177876 hes the top junior and i think its good to see the junior tournament qualifies you for the mens it just goes to show that no matter what age you are you can play with the men

5177880 we came out really crisp and were running hard and we got a few lucky breaks on them in the first but they got into the game and started making it interesting
5177881 its good to see such a good rivalry it was a good battle
5177882 it was too late before we came up with a plan to stop their transition game
5177883 our first period has been our downfall all year against these guys we came back a little too late and ran out of gas after a long weekend of late night beveraging with the boys theyre a tough team to beat and you cant have an off day
5177884 weve played them seven times in the prince george senior lacrosse association final series and they seem to come back every time they dont give up
5177885 were just a bunch of guys who love lacrosse and we had some fun this weekend this is an awesome group of guys and i think we would have won if wed gone down to kelowna
5177886 i think we expected it of her we thought if she ever would go to the olympics shed end up on top of the heap somehow and she did
5177887 she never puts on any airs when shes going to do something she just goes in and does it shes never forgotten the community or her parents she has lots of respect for all of the people who have helped her shes just a lovely person and an excellent wrestler
5177888 carol started with a number of other girls and she and two or three of her friends had a gracefulness about them they walked with balance and power and they had those things that you dont coach and there was no question if i could get her to like the sport she would do well
5177889 right from the start i had no doubt that she would be a champion to whatever level she chose to go to im thrilled for carol but im also so happy for the community which has put so much into these kids they do it so willingly not because they think theyll win gold its just because they want to support the young people its nice to see they got a payoff and a big one
5177890 its a tough job in a small community holding a program together when the school system has no funds to support it
5177891 you have to do it all by local fundraising the community of hazelton is one of the hardest hit economically in the province and theyve been wonderful theyve never failed in supporting their young people in these sports
5177892 for myself i feel a sense of relief as much as anything ive been at this a lot of years and its really nice to know the long hours on the road in blizzards and the months of cutting and delivering firewood was really worth it this verifies that
5177893 kate is as good of a training partner as carol could get she knows her intimately and is good enough to push her too
5177894 i dont remember exactly how it came up but her mother told me when i was in high school they snuck in the back door a couple of times and had a look i never knew
5177895 it was so moving watching the medal presentation and im sure i was thinking the same thing as carol was when she said how happy she was to be a canadian

5177898 im going to miss all my friends who go to barlow vincent and i wont know a lot of people at my new school
5177899 i think it is great we were able to get the kids together like this i know it is going to be hard for some of them and some of the parents
5177900 i hope we can do this every year im going to miss seeing these kids and i would enjoy seeing them every year and seeing how they change and grow
5177901 you can say youll keep in touch but with all the activities and everything it is really hard
5177902 school is like church we all gather and join in the activities and it is going to be different for a while
5177903 im kinda excited to meet some new friends and besides well all meet up again in high school
5177904 most everyone is looking forward to getting the school year started and moving on
5177905 we can always step away from it if its crap
5177906 while theyre in the pose we talk about the fact that if youre balanced in your physical body then you can bring balance to your mind
5177907 for a doctor to recommend meditation and hes never tried it
5177908 thats going to be kind of hard first weve got to know what works and then we have to let people experience that it works
5177909 you just have to focus on one object in front of you
5177910 theres more of a connection with them and more of a desire to bring about that state of calmness and let go of anger
5177911 you feel that kind of openness when you walk into the room people are just wanting more tools and more alternatives to medication
5177912 to the extent there have been some more stresses in the economy yes were looking at those things more

5177919 hey man want to buy the rest of those condoms from me
5177920 i think we have an ethical responsibility a moral responsibility and were shirking it
5177921 sometimes physicians dont know what theyre looking at because historically there has not been education on elder abuse provided in medical training
5177922 dependent on an abuser to meet needs that otherwise would be unmet
5177923 if the caregiver suspects the patient is talking to the doctor
5177924 dont want to get involved with the legal system or the social service system
5177925 tend to minimize the role of physicians in addressing elder abuse
5177926 women start adult life happier than men but end up less happy
5177927 women are more likely than men to be in long term relationships and this makes for greater fulfillment of both family life and material
5177928 most of these developments are approaching 20 years in age and most of these are long term residents they are members of the community and neighborhood stability affects everything we do
5177929 if we dont do anything then were definitely going to lose those units
5177930 a lot of these buildings are in gentrifying communities they are important in that they provide affordable housing and they keep these communities diverse
5177931 otherwise were looking at neighborhoods only for the rich and wealthy
5177932 when you lose project based housing that results in a net loss of affordable housing for the community
5177933 that subsidy ends at a cliff and theres nothing for the tenants

5177937 weve released a number of videos to show off the game
5177938 when we started spore we were thinking about how wed make an engine that had the possibility of expansion so yes well add to the experience
5177939 i think however we have a very cool opportunity to take spore in a few different directions too the editors are so cool and fun that we want to advance those as well as the gameplay that we put into the core game
5177940 we are not shipping with the flora editor sorry its something we eventually want to get out there as it is fun to work with

5177944 the deployment of new missile defense elements in europe has the russian federation as its aim
5177945 events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
5177946 led the fight for lower taxes and spending in the state legislature and joined gov sarah palin in pushing for reform in the state
5177947 we have been working in association with ngos in the country to reach out to those elements who are deprived of basic education health facilities and so on rather than starting an organisation right from the grass root level our idea of working with the ngos is that they have already established themselves in their fields while tying up with them we get an opportunity to reach out to their people there is value addition to their work by taking up programmes that we have developed
5177948 it is a booming sector and has an impact on the economy of this country we believe that bringing that management to help the socially challenged sectors would certainly help them progress we have therefore introduced a programme under which the corporates undertake the responsibility of one center but at the same time help us in establishing a twin center away from the first one
5177949 our teachers and faculty members are the ones who train the students on these programmes the teachers resource programme has been developed by azeem premji foundation and not only that we have tied up with unicef to provide medical care for these people
5177950 the nasscom knowledge network is a unique approach towards public private partnerships and we are glad to be one the first it companies to sponsor a knowledge centre we plan to expand our own efforts to support nasscom foundation to reach out to centres in other states to enable education at the grass root levels across the country through technology reach out programmes

5177953 war is not healthy for children and other living things
5177954 i think it is wholly inappropriate that people should display any kind of weaponry whether it is replica or not
5177955 symbolism like this should not be used particularly from our partys perspective
5177956 families of the victims who were killed through collusion would have decided to have the replica in the display
5177957 any criticism is typical of unionist denial around collusion and death squads

5177962 those grey skies and the terrain ireland is one of the few places that lives up to the hype
5177963 it is as beautiful as everybody tells you it is so it is a very good place to make a film
5177964 sharing in the universal mission is the sign of maturity in faith and of a christian life that bears fruit in this way individual believers extend the reach of their charity and show concern for those both far and near they pray for the missions and missionary vocations they help missionaries and follow their work with interest and when missionaries return they welcome them with the same joy with which the first christian communities heard from the apostles the marvelous things which god had wrought through their preaching cf acts 14 27
5177965 should accompany the journey of missionaries so that the proclamation of the word will be effective through gods grace
5177966 i am convinced that without the power of prayer without that intimate union with the lord our human endeavors would achieve very little
5177967 the missions ask not only for a contribution but for a sharing in the work of preaching and charity toward the poor
5177968 christ has no body now on earth but yours no hands but yours no feet but yours yours are the eyes through which christs compassion is to look out to the earth yours are the feet by which he is to go about doing good and yours are the hands by which he is to bless us now

5178022 are there parallels that can be drawn to derive some actionable insights to help transform discoms to profit making world class organizations
5178023 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5178024 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5178025 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5178026 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5178027 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5178028 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5178029 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5178038 what weve produced with the online component is not a marketing line in the budget its part of the delivery of scorched
5178039 perhaps what you can do is start to regard television as the advertisement for whats online rather than whats online as the advertisement for whats on television
5178040 its not like we end up with a frozen site theres still weeks and weeks of content that is set to roll out after the telemovie goes to air which continues to reveal the story and the aftermath of what happens after sydney burns down

5178043 the next minute timon knocked on our room screaming that the fire was coming and that we had to get our luggage and go to the tour bus
5178044 as soon as i saw the flames and felt the tremendous heat i was terrified
5178045 we could not wait any longer as we feared the flames would cause the bus to explode so we left
5178046 i had to run through the fire with my daughter to get to safety i thought we were going to die
5178047 in other instances we will impress upon schools and clubs involved to take strong action against their own supporters and parents who misbehave or otherwise the unions will consider action against them

5178050 when we arrived on the scene the driver was dead
5178051 he was killed instantly when the truck landed on its roof
5178052 we attempted to load the trucks container onto a flatbed truck
5178053 with permission from the insurance company we were allowed to give the oranges away to the public
5178054 we must warn all drivers taking the albany road off ramp to use caution as a large portion of the barriers has been destroyed

5178057 it is so good that we now have access to electric power water and proper sanitation some people here have been waiting 10 years for this and at last it is happening
5178058 the water supply may be communal but it is better than no water
5178059 not only are the logistics of moving people out of and then back to their places of residence complex but much of the area lies on an outcrop of sandstone which necessitates working through rocky ground to install the services
5178060 but we are enjoying the challenge of the work and it is a project that is eminently worthwhile

5178070 then out of the blue two days before the christmas long weekend last year we were informed that finances for an arv facility had been made available from the fancourt foundation and construction began in january
5178071 now we can go ahead with housing as the urgent arv treatment need has been met at the last board meeting the question of housing provision was discussed in detail again and a decision reached that housing would not be for high and middle income groups but that the planned 80 to 90 units would sell for about r400000

5178074 i think i just lost a few seconds of concentration
5178075 i was already racing for five hours adrenaline was pumping and i wanted to win that stage i saw the side approaching and i knew i should slow down but it was too late
5178076 im pretty happy with my olympics results although i wouldve liked to do better
5178077 i spent my 21st birthday in a hotel room but this year i was in beijing where i spent time shopping that was fun
5178078 we are the only government in the world that gives people free houses it is not because we are crazy but because we believe that shelter is the integral part of restoring a persons dignity i hope people will treasure and know that these houses ares given to them with sincerity
5178079 people have been patient with us because as this was a pilot project it meant that it was a trial and error exercise
5178080 thanks to the councillors as well for mobilising people because in other areas we have not received this kind of support

5178083 homicidal african dictator who stays in power against all odds
5178084 he listens a lot he just blinks and listens he lets you talk he leans back with his head cocked to one side resting on his hands
5178085 you can never ever convince an englishman that you are equal to him never
5178086 he was the star and then the sun came up
5178087 it was my job to apply to the police for clearance to hold party meetings
5178088 bright flames my brick and thatch house already on fire
5178089 i see you i know who you are and you are the ones who have burned down my house
5178090 i decided better for me to come out or they will kill my family
5178091 im going to go out and when they come after me you must all run away as fast as you can and hide
5178092 i heard the bones in my arms crack and i cried out oh jesus im dying here what have i done wrong
5178093 lets leave him come back and finish him off tonight
5178094 i was in such terrible pain and i thought i was dying and i decided better to kill myself than just wait for them to come
5178095 one hears these things generally but one is not sure if they are true of the details
5178096 i was politically conscious yes but never in my wildest dreams did i expect to be in this position
5178097 in africa they usually use the gun we have resisted that
5178098 a long time ago in a beautiful land far from here
5178099 and the only sound to be heard in that beautiful land was the drone of the kings voice
5178100 but in that time there were songs that the king could not reach these were the peoples most precious songs the songs they sang in their dreams in the dry valleys of dreamland the silent choirs sang their songs the battered men in forgotten jails the broken women on foreign soils families resting in unmarked graves the hungry the lost the landless and their songs rose like thunderclouds over the land
5178101 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5178102 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5178103 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
5178104 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5178105 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
5178106 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them
5178107 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart
5178108 but i dont want to weaken myself with these thoughts
5178109 the peace of mind i have now i never had before i suffered much more mental anguish in my married life
5178110 i feel that her hands call me again and again
5178111 when i see them i want to be like them strong girls
5178112 i want to make a name for myself in this profession
5178113 im independent now i stand on my own two feet
5178114 i have a job i work i earn in fact im living on my own which isnt an easy thing to do for a woman in pakistan for a lone woman to survive
5178115 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted i think its really very much time for them to do what they say theyre going to do
5178116 the signings occurred yesterday and in this respect i expect a quick withdrawal of the russian troops which unfortunately according to my information has until now still not been implemented as we expected it
5178117 it is really a place where you can feel in a very strong way to what extent displaced people are uprooted they are vulnerable and dependent
5178118 im getting a little worried this is my first storm weve been down here about a year and we are getting a little apprehensive we were out on the water looking at the clouds a little earlier boy we came back in fast though

5178137 while we lost to australia as they are among the best in the world in hockey we gave them a good game and they didnt win easily
5178138 my sister and i have a mutual understanding of the game we are very competitive and yet the competition helps us push harder and harder
5178139 i play the left link and we love hockey we are planning to play for the u 21 sa team the next tour will be inter provincial then they will chose the u 21 team
5178140 the sport is not that strong in this province and when you play in bigger provinces like gauteng and western cape the competition becomes tougher
5178141 teams have 16 players and you must always shine and come to the top the game needs someone who is self motivated
5178142 you must be in top form if you want to play this sport the sad thing about this game is you never know when your career will end one must accept failures that will come before success

5178226 were going to give the americans a good shake and hopefully keep phelpsy from getting his eighth gold
5178227 without the help of my teammates this wouldnt be possible
5178228 i think back to that 4x100 relay we came together from winning by one 100th to doing a best time in every event its been nothing but a roller coaster and its been nothing but fun

5178241 the longer manchester united battered against newcastle uniteds well blockaded backdoor the higher dimitar berbatovs value rose
5178242 im now in tottenham but no one can disagree with me wanting to follow my dream im not angry about the decision of juande ramos to name me as a sub im not crying i only show my emotions to my close friends and family if i had been laughing when i was on the bench people would say i was an idiot eric cantona never smiled but i dont know if anyone ever asked him why he didnt look happier
5178243 i dont think berbatovs head is there anymore it is not with spurs and i think he is looking for a move i think he is a very important player for the club you can see spurs without berbatov are a different team without keane as well they are a different team they are huge players it will be very difficult to replace berbatov he is a class player he is not affected by anything around him it was the same with keano he is one of the best players i have ever played with losing them i think will be difficult for spurs
5178244 have two international strikers but a midfield that seems to have no way of getting the ball to them
5178245 steven taylor was superb and fabricio coloccini recovered from a nervous start
5178246 mark hughes and hammers manager alan curbishleys post match drink being a sombre affair
5178247 without michael owen who is there to fear in englands front line nobody really
5178248 with a population of about 3 000 this borough of sinsheim in southwestern germany is the smallest town in the top tier of any leading league
5178249 scolari began his reign here by integrating all four of his attacking midfielders anchored by the young man mountain mikel john obi mikel was crucial to this performance striding easily and unchallenged to provide the base from which the creative talents flourished he looked the perfect successor to claude makelele
5178250 scolaris chelsea play fast overlapping full backs a high creative midfield line and have in john obi mikel a holding midfield player who doubles as a centre half in the style of gilberto silva it puts them quickly on the offensive but always with the padlock secure at the back and portsmouth found them unplayable the role of mikel who drops in as a third centre half when the backs operate as wingers is a masterstroke and brought out the best from the nigeria player this was his finest game in a chelsea shirt and michael essiens return to the first team cannot be regarded as a formality
5178251 bosingwa was a constant threat while deco was the star of the show although he escaped punishment for a shocking challenge on lassana diarra in the opening minute deco set most of the charges for chelsea to fire and he deserved his late goal although it was waved in by a shocking attempt at a save from david james he looked built for the role of injecting some fantasy into chelseas style but judgement must be reserved for sterner battles ahead few teams will give deco or chelsea as much room as they were afforded by portsmouth their passing and creation was outstanding but they were aided and abetted by a total absence of tackling and urgency from portsmouth
5178252 unscrambled for a sporting context this suggests a team that they should only engage in battle on terms favourable to themselves chelsea followed this concept to the letter yesterday controlling the game with an exhibition of creative movement that portsmouth could never hope to emulate a lack of width in midfield meant nothing with bosingwa called to act less as a right back than as a winger joe cole was similarly menacing on the right flank and his fleetness of foot seizing upon a quick exchange between michael ballack and nicolas anelka helped propel chelsea into a 12th minute lead
5178253 early days yet for portsmouth but yesterdays performance was insipid harry redknapp bemoaned defending that was like a and cited an injury crisis that forced him to play younes kaboul in the centre of midfield it is safe to say that the former tottenham central defender is no paul scholes but it is the lack of width that makes portsmouth so predictable with papa bouba dioup and nico kranjcar anonymous on the flanks pompey scarcely put one decent cross in for jermain defoe and peter crouch what is evident is that without sulley muntari and to a lesser extent pedro mendes both of whom redknapp said he did want to sell the fa cup winners are not quite the same force they have two international strikers but a midfield that seems to have no way of getting the ball to them
5178254 the credit should go to a newcastle defence in which steven taylor was superb and fabricio coloccini recovered from a nervous start to demonstrate why newcastle had thought him worthy of paying deportivo de la coru a 10 3m another new recruit jonas gutierrez was equally impressive when newcastle attacked combining pace and drive on the left wing whereas danny guthrie looks an extremely shrewd signing from liverpool keegan later described him as the games outstanding performer
5178255 this was not the game in which they would have expected to drop points in a tough start to the season but with ronaldo sidelined carlos t vez absent because of a family bereavement and dimitar berbatov yet to complete his protracted move from tottenham hotspur they lacked the wit and the penetration to break down a surprisingly spirited newcastle not a great start for the champions for whom a game of catchup beckons but reassuringly the cavalry berbatov included is on its way
5178256 the longer manchester united battered against newcastle uniteds well blockaded backdoor the higher dimitar berbatovs value rose with chelsea finding their stride so quickly the double winners know they may have to stump up 30 million to bring in the striker from tottenham hotspur on this evidence they cannot wait berbatov certainly cannot wait
5178257 there was an ill ease about citys performance that suggested that there was more to the defeat than a lack of player conditioning the game with west ham united next weekend takes on an even greater significance and its hard to imagine hughes and hammers manager alan curbishleys post match drink will be anything other than a sombre affair as both take heed of their respective positions a loss for city would send them into the second leg of their uefa cup tie as well as domestic games away to sunderland and at home to luiz felipe scolaris chelsea on minus confidence
5178258 it is in the peripheral areas of the pitch liverpool struggle for all his endeavour dirk kuyt is not a right winger with all due respect to the skilful yossi benayoun one would struggle to see him holding down a place in the manchester united or chelsea side benayoun is certainly good enough to be part of a squad but not to start every game if ryan babel returns from the olympics to play on the left wing then liverpool will have two forwards playing as wide men why benitez has not strengthened in these wide areas is inexplicable fans are left to wonder how much more balanced liverpool could look if david silva had been pursued with the same vigour as gareth barry this summer
5178259 some people say that the situation at anfield has reached a point of no return i predict something else football is a results based business after all and if liverpool can manage to get four or five early season victories under their belt then the tensions will be swept under the carpet everybody can then focus their energies upon what can become a very good season at anfield with the realistic aim of achieving a top two premiership finish
5178260 on the evidence of this first home game of the new premier league campaign the fatal flaws that haunted them in the final two months of last term have not been solved as their brilliant passing and silky movement were undermined by an inability to kill off an opponent when they have them at their mercy
5178261 without michael owen who is there to fear in englands front line nobody really gabriel agbonlahor scored a seven minute hat trick for aston villa yesterday but he has been demoted to the under21s and has not played in any of capellos build up games so it is fair to assume the manager was not impressed with what he witnessed in training dean ashton is injured but anybody who saw his match against trinidad amp tobago is incredulous that he was to get a second chance so soon wayne rooney perhaps but he is the second striker the villa to englands missing link their absent torres against the czech republic on wednesday capello will choose a partner for rooney from jermain defoe emile heskey and theo walcott and which of that trio is going to take two men out of the game as torres did at euro 2008

5178274 if it is your intention to license and operate the new whittier pavilion as a psychiatric mental health facility it is my opinion that you will need a special permit from the city council for this change or modification of existing use
5178275 they have given us affidavits from staff psychiatrists that they did provide care and services to psychiatric patients in the building
5178276 they also had a contract at one time with danvers state hospital to treat psychiatric patients

5178331 ich kann es nicht fassen und bin bergl cklich die meisterschaft schon beim vorletzten rennen gewonnen zu haben m glich war dieser erfolg durch ein auto das mit seiner balance nicht nur fantastisch zu fahren ist sondern zudem technisch ohne jegliche probleme durch die saison fuhr und nat rlich durch unser team das ebenso fehlerfrei gearbeitet hat dass wir auch den teamtitel gewonnen haben unterstreicht die leistung der crew der heutige erfolg und der meistertitel sind nach meinem sieg bei den 24 stunden von le mans im juni ein weiteres highlight meiner rennfahrerkarriere

5178343 this is not a childrens picture although it touches on the imaginative powers and emotional resilience of children its another slice of hous distinctly poetic realism and as such also a kind of tribute to paris the paris of both today and of the older film
5178344 a gem made by a filmmaker who loves life and knows how to capture its ebb and flow and sweet complication
5178345 because its one of the most beautiful films ever because its a work of art on the order of a poem by yeats or a painting by rothko

5178475 the gothic idea that we are to look backwards instead of forwards for the improvement of the human mind and to recur to the annals of our ancestors for what is most perfect in government in religion and in learning is worthy of those bigots in religion amp government by whom it has been recommended amp whose purposes it would answer
5178476 what an effort my dear sir of bigotry in politics amp religion have we gone through the barbarians really flattered themselves that they should be able to bring back the times of power amp priestcraft all advances in sciences were proscribed as innovations they pretended to praise and encourage education but it was to be the education of our ancestors we were to look backwards not forwards for improvement

5178493 highly complex yet i am determined to try to preserve this relationship and to cool the rhetoric i take this relationship very personally and i want to handle it that way
5178494 i think i would have been less convinced that we should keep relations with them going after tiananmen square
5178495 i am absolutely convinced that american public opinion will turn against this rhetoric at some point in a relationship which is very important to china will be damaged

5178500 a blunt fact about mr dewey should be faced it is that many people do not like him he is unfortunately one of the least seductive personalities in public life that he has made an excellent record as governor is indisputable even so people resent what they call his vindictiveness the metallic and two dimensional nature of his efficiency his cockiness which actually conceals a nature basically shy and his suspiciousness that mr dewey is crammed with ego is well known his voice is baritone but he can sound terror notes people say that his sense of humor is vestigial and that he is as devoid of charm as a rivet or a lump of stone
5178501 i had some ideas of my own and in order to carry them out i had to run for reelection and be reelected and that is exactly what happened
5178502 the name of a town we travelers on the truman campaign train have been in doesnt stand for a plot of earth or a group of buildings it stands for a particular audience or a particular incident
5178503 i am certain that no matter what the fate of the truman administration millions of americans will for the rest of their lives have framed in their minds eye a vivid image of the three traveling trumans the president his wife bess and their daughter margaret highballing off into the black nights of colorado or arizona blending with the tall pines of the sierras or being slowly enveloped by the dust of the midwestern plains it will be a picture to cherish and it will stand harry truman in good stead for the rest of his life traveling with him you get the feeling that the american people who have seen him and heard him at his best would be willing to give him just about anything he wants except the presidency
5178504 candidates notoriously promise better than they ever perform but if governor dewey manages the presidency half as well as he is managing his campaign for it we are about to have four eight twelve sixteen years of cool sleek efficiency in government everything ive seen of the dewey campaign is slick and snappy this is in strong contrast to the general dowdiness and good natured slovenliness of the truman campaign at least when and where i observed it
5178505 i will do the greatest pruning and weeding operation in american history

5178514 kneeling has always been my weakest position as i told you the other day too
5178515 i knew that if i do well in this position i would make it to the final unfortunately i didnt
5178516 yes i could have done better in the prone and standing too then i could have made up for my failing in kneeling so it was basically a combination of all three also by the time i reached the kneeling i was beginning to get tired
5178517 first my right shoe lace was tight then my balance was a bit tilted towards the front by the time everything was settled it was too late

5178533 he is a wise man he is a very experienced man and he has seen the writing on the wall
5178534 he has seen the sentiments of not just the elected representatives but various institutions who all asked him to move in a particular way and do not destabilise things here
5178535 his political fate has been sealed whatever he says doesnt matter

5178541 faced with little agreement among previous studies searching for the genomic hot spots in bipolar disorder these researchers pooled their data for maximal statistical power and unearthed surprising results improved understanding of these abnormalities could lead to new hope for the millions of americans affected by bipolar disorder
5178542 we have copied nature taking the elements and mechanisms found in plant life that have evolved over 3 billion years and recreated one of those processes in the laboratory
5178543 the breakthrough came when we coated a proton conductor called nafion onto an anode to form a polymer membrane just a few micrometres thick which acts as a host for the manganese clusters
5178544 normally insoluble in water when we bound the catalyst within the pores of the nafion membrane it was stabilised against decomposition and importantly water could reach the catalyst where it was oxidized on exposure to light
5178545 whilst man has been able to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for years we have been able to do the same thing for the first time using just sunlight an electrical potential of 1 2 volts and the very chemical that nature has selected for this purpose
5178546 we need to continue to learn from nature so that we can better master this process
5178547 the production of hydrogen using nothing but water and sunlight offers the possibility of an abundant renewable green source of energy for the future for communities across the world

5178593 there was some interest in converting syngas into ethanol during the first oil crisis back in the 70s
5178594 the problem was that catalysis technology at that time didnt allow selectivity in the byproducts they could produce ethanol but youd also get methane aldehydes and a number of other undesirable products
5178595 if we can increase this activated co adsorption on the surface of the catalyst it improves the opportunity for the formation of ethanol molecules
5178596 and if we can increase the amount of surface area for the catalyst we can increase the amount of ethanol produced
5178597 gasification to ethanol has received increasing attention as an attractive approach to reaching the federal renewable fuel standard of 36 billion gallons of biofuel
5178598 the great thing about using syngas to produce ethanol is that it expands the kinds of materials that can be converted into fuels
5178599 you can use the waste product from the distilling process or any number of other sources of biomass such as switchgrass or wood pulp basically any carbon based material can be converted into syngas and once we have syngas we can turn that into ethanol

5178603 pg and es announcement represents the largest single photovoltaic commitment from an electric utility anywhere in the world
5178604 it represents the pinnacle in a series of large and innovative u s electric utility solar projects that have been announced in the last six months
5178605 these two solar project configurations represent competing technology advancements we have seen in the photovoltaic industry recently
5178606 each is aiming for the lowest cost per kilowatt hour but have diverging techniques for getting there optisolars thin film technology is lower efficiency but the panels and installation configuration are designed to minimize costs sunpowers technology is the highest commercial efficiency in the industry which commands a premium price but with the tracking technology they are aiming to produce more kilowatt hours per solar panel
5178607 pg and es solar portfolio has continued to grow year after year
5178608 they continually raise the bar for other utilities and send a clear message that solar electricity is an option to be taken seriously by all those in the energy business
5178609 these landmark agreements signal the arrival of utility scale pv solar power that may be cost competitive with solar thermal and wind energy
5178610 we will continue to explore such innovative technologies as we aggressively work to increase the amount of renewable energy we provide our customers
5178611 we are very happy to be working with pg and e to help meet californias requirements for clean renewable energy and are committed to working closely with the local community as this project moves forward
5178612 our solar farms are quiet and emission free with solar panels mounted near ground level to minimize visual impact implementing cost competitive solar power on this scale establishes thin film photovoltaic generation as an important contributor to global sustainability
5178613 today high efficiency photovoltaic technology is a competitively priced component of utility scale peak power generation
5178614 our experience constructing more than 350 megawatts of solar systems on three continents allows us to deliver utility scale systems quickly and at a scale of hundreds of kilowatts to hundreds of megawatts we design our solar systems to maximize energy harvest while adapting to the natural topography of the site and serving the needs of the community

5178628 there are excellent benchmarking tools around investors in people and the people capability maturity model are two prime examples however being hr tools these are too generic to be of much practical use to training and learning managers our training management maturity model fills this gap by being very specific to assessing the learning capability of an organization also by taking a phased approach in which improvement is achieved in stages organizations can better plan their improvement efforts and budgets
5178629 what is most important in any assessment is uncovering actionable tasks that the organization can do to take it forward the training management maturity model is practical through and through leading the organization to examine its key practices and identify deficiencies the assessment can then be conducted again at a later date to check on progress

5178648 i started nursery know it all to give new and expectant parents the support and confidence they need so that they can concentrate on a more important role parenting
5178649 with everything online these days parents spend a lot more time than theyd like just researching ideas products and things to be aware of
5178650 but nursery know it all has already tried these products sifted through information and spent the countless hours doing this legwork for them
5178651 with more dual income households families being spread out and our lives getting busier parents are finding themselves stressed out by the to do list for parenthood
5178652 a service like nursery know it all means that busy parents get to spend more quality time with each other enjoying pregnancy rather than spending countless hours researching and searching for products services and childcare
5178653 my husband and i found all the new baby things a parent needs to buy so overwhelming nursery know it all provided us with helpful advice and guidance and it was an unbelievable time saver it was a more personalized experience unlike just reading a book
5178654 as a first time mom i spent hours pouring over all of the books that recommend the best baby products but once i walked into the store i was so overwhelmed and confused kim took me through everything she helped me choose products based on what i needed now and what id need six months from now ive since had my second child and again used the services of nursery know it all to better understand what i need and dont need for two young children
5178655 as a mother of three young children i know how stressful having a baby can be not only are you adapting to your new role of motherhood and the changing family dynamic whether its your first or your fifth child but the little things like thank you cards researching childcare options and buying things like cribs and strollers can take hours of time to research and can get really overwhelming
5178656 i feel like ive won the business lottery being featured by ken as one of his regular people experts is a dream come true for a mom working from home in the suburbs trying to make a real difference in the world
5178657 however it is important for taxpayers to be educated on the irs and their collection agencies when dealing with owed back taxes
5178658 for many individuals who owe back taxes to the irs the culprit behind the tax debt is the estimated tax payment
5178659 have you ever dealt with an irs representative who is less than helpful this is a frustrating predicament for taxpayers that just want to put their irs tax debt behind them so they can move on with their lives however it is easy to forget that the irs is staffed by human beings with all the common foibles of ordinary people even though they may not always demonstrate them openly irs representatives often allow their own emotions and personal problems to creep into their work furthermore irs employees have varying levels of competency and skill if you have been working with the irs to settle your tax liabilities and feel that you have been treated unfairly or incompetently you may want to request the assistance of the taxpayer advocate service
5178660 nfl schedules were a source of difficulty using the web for nfl schedule prints out for easy display in office cube or home

5178678 rich lowry historically 30 years ago it meant a former liberal who became a conservative
5178679 they were associated with irving kristols journal the public interest that had a lot of social science pieces poking empirical holes in liberal theory
5178680 in fact one of the foremost neoconservatives norman podhoretz wrote an obituary for this distinction several years ago because it just seemed to no longer matter
5178681 and with the war on terror you saw neoconservatives emerging as a distinct tendency within conservatism mostly on foreign policy its hallmarks being extreme interventionism extremely idealistic foreign policy and emphasis on democracy building and spreading human rights and freedom and an overestimation in my view of how easy it is to spread democracy and liberty to spots in the world where it doesnt exist currently

5178697 sexb cher beschreiben in der regel die mechanik des physischen aktes in unserem buch geht es darum was im kopf passiert
5178698 selbst wenn es probleme in der partnerschaft gibt kann ein mann noch immer sex haben w hrend eine frau dann nicht mehr will jedoch machen beide den mangel an sex f r das ende der beziehung verantwortlich tats chlich gibt es aber immer einen grund warum der sex pl tzlich aufgeh rt hat man muss nur den emotionalen ausl ser finden
5178699 m nner k nnen stress und konflikte sehr gut durch sex abbauen bei frauen f hrt stress aber eher zu lustlosigkeit und letztendlich zur totalverweigerung
5178700 sie werden sehen sobald sie sich von diesem idealbild gel st haben nimmt der stress enorm ab und sie haben wieder die lust sich beim sex hinzugeben
5178701 ist man auch nur auf einem level mit den gedanken woanders gibts beim sex automatisch probleme viele schaffen es nicht sich v llig gehen zu lassen und abzuschalten man muss sich darauf konditionieren beim akt v llig pr sent zu sein
5178702 im stadium der ersten verliebtheit stellen wir uns den sex mit dieser person vor lassen uns gedanklich von ihr verf hren sex explosion inszenieren wir im kopf ein einzigartiges liebesfeuerwerk wenn man sich nicht selbst mit eigenen gedanken verf hren kann hat jemand anderer einen wirklich harten job zu erledigen
5178703 der punkt ist die meis te zeit hetzen wir durchs leben ohne die kleinen sensationen zu beachten die auf uns tagt glich warten wir sind einfach zu abgestumpft um den partner genie en zu k nnen
5178704 steigen sie gleich in den erotischen bereich ein und ver suchen sich selbst positiv wahrzunehmen z b in reizw sche vor dem spiegel zu posieren und diese selbstliebe auf den partner zu bertragen
5178705 das wichtigste ist dass man seinen partner auch nach vielen jahren noch riechen und schmecken kann sonst hilft leider die beste dusche nichts
5178706 are we doing enough to make the world a better place
5178707 well i dont feel it would be good to do im doing ceremony with janica on saturday a lie and with my daughter on wednesday
5178708 right now i cant believe i got out of gaza it is an unbelievable situation trying to travel from there it might take about 14 hours to get halfway across the world but just to get out of the gaza strip i need weeks
5178709 it is very beautiful to be here in beijing the facilities are just unimaginably great the situation is awful in gaza for everyone of course and it is also very bad for sports the israelis are constantly launching attacks on gaza there is a siege all our facilities have been damaged or destroyed we dont have a proper athletics stadium we all have to do our training on the street
5178710 all the athletes in gaza dream of taking part in the olympic games one day but the opportunities are few
5178711 it is incredibly important for palestinian athletes to compete at the olympics palestinians should be present at all the worlds major sporting events our participation brings the palestinian cause to everyones attention
5178712 i got a call a few months ago from two people who said they were from michelin and would like to see our facilities i showed them around the hotel
5178713 we are really excited to have a michelin guide for hong kong will help us measure the quality of our culinary experience and keep us up to the standard with international gourmet cities such as new york and paris
5178714 its good to have a guide like that but we cant take it too seriously
5178715 chinese cuisines have so many varieties and even a guide like michelin cant represent everybodys tastes in food
5178716 sie sind solche attraktiven jungen frauen interessieren sie sich eigentlich f r mode
5178717 ich m chte ihnen recht herzlich zu ihrem erfolg gratulieren und w rde gerne wissen wie lange sie glauben china auf ihrem weiteren weg noch dienen zu k nnen

5178719 we were going down the second fairway and my caddie mark long said lets say you are four behind
5178720 we were trying to make it as if we were behind all day dont protect anything and fire at all the flags
5178721 he got to 6 up after 15 and i just took my foot off the gas
5178722 weve kind of thrown the same type of game out again very little offence and the pitching was absolutely great
5178723 you have to tip your cap to the pitcher sometime but it gets to a point where youve got to make things happen
5178724 it was a game we had to have it was a must game for us and again we just couldnt generate the offence when it was needed
5178725 i was giving him a fastball that i wanted him to either swing at and put in play or take for a strike
5178726 i didnt want to fall behind 3 0 so i gave him one to hit it was a little bit higher than id like and he put a pretty good swing on it
5178727 some big situations came up and i couldnt get the job done
5178728 for many years catholics were denied public office by voters who feared that they would take direction from the pope
5178729 i thought what it would be like to bring people together who do the same thing but from different perspectives
5178730 im thinking of the young person sitting at home who has to know that theres a world outside of the arts outside of the athletes you always hear our people say that the only way out of the hood is to be the artist or the athlete youve got to show them neurosurgeon dr ben carson youve got to show them entertainment executive sylvia rhone thats our doing
5178731 i think we live in a time when people are afraid to struggle they think you stand in a line sing one song people actually think that you go from that line to simon paula and randy

5178733 maar doordat accell dreigde met een rechtszaak vanwege patentbreuk zijn ze afgehaakt
5178734 bovendien zijn chinese producenten heel angstig voor inbreuk op patenten zodra iemand hier met een papiertje komt zwaaien stoppen ze de productie door de intimidatie is ook dit jaar voor de derde keer ons seizoen naar de knoppen we blijven nu met 15 000 fietsen zitten
5178735 bij het ontwerpen van de fiets zijn we erg consci ntieus geweest om niet de sparta ion na te maken
5178736 maar we willen ook compensatie van accell en de toezegging dat ze mijn klanten niet meer intimideren
5178737 in het sparta patent gaat het bijvoorbeeld over de planetaire werking van de fiets hoe dat werkt wordt niet uiteengezet daarnaast wordt omschreven dat de hulpmotor op de as van het wiel hub motor in vaktermen red allang bestaat dat klopt die is in 1902 uitgevonden vervolgens claimen zij die motor onder hun patent
5178738 en als iemand het er niet mee eens is dan zijn daar offici le wegen voor een partij kan oppositie instellen en dan kunnen wij ons verdedigen vervolgens beslist de octrooiraad of het patent deugt maar we hebben het nagezocht en prime tech heeft geen offici le klacht ingediend
5178739 de commerci le waarde van een patent valt niet te onderschatten en er zijn langdurige juridische procedures voor nodig om een dergelijk patent ongedaan te maken we vragen de europese gemeenschap om een diepgaand onderzoek in te stellen naar dit patent van accell dat naar onze mening ten onrechte is verstrekt onze vraag is waarom is dit patent ondertekend wetende dat het handelde over allang bestaande onderdelen

5178799 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5178800 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5178801 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5178802 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5178803 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5178809 the web is changing daily and i am amazed at how quickly this development team responds to new challenges and opportunities impresscms will certainly become one of the major players in the next generation of content management systems
5178810 the most dramatic was how the abercrombie employees treated sarah in comparison to how they treated me
5178811 as soon as she walked in the cashier started talking to her and told her she could meet with the manager
5178812 the manager talked to me for a long time and told me that it really didnt matter that i didnt have any experience in retail
5178813 he asked what school i went to and things like that then he asked for my phone number so he could call me about the interview
5178814 he called me three times before that friday to remind me about the interview
5178815 i waited in line to ask the cashier if i could fill out an application and she tried to not even acknowledge i was there
5178816 when it was my turn she actually turned to the man behind me and asked if she could help him he told her that i was first
5178817 she literally shoved the toddler behind her and rushed away like i was a dangerous person
5178818 she was hesitant but then she said well actually we are hiring
5178819 she asked if i had any experience and told me that i needed at least two job references but you could tell it was a joke they had no interest in hiring me
5178820 i understand the importance of portraying a certain image but the abercrombie employees didnt even know if i was the worst employee ever they just knew i looked a certain way
5178821 its sad that the idea of marketing and strategy is so focused on an image that they dont even take the time to see which potential employee might be better for the job
5178822 i think this proved that you have to know what an employer expects if you want to get a job there

5178847 he should tender his resignation pack up his bags and go
5178848 whatever little moral authority was left has now been completely eroded
5178849 this thing must be clear to everyone that president musharraf is not going to resign period
5178850 this is an issue that is not on the table
5178851 we want stability in the country we want political stability
5178852 i think we take for granted the fact weve been on top of the game for i dont know how many olympics before i know it was really hard for us that nobody got a medal
5178853 whos better than jamaica mon i need to go there mon
5178854 im excited oh my god i cant believe i actually won
5178855 nobody expected me to win so there was no pressure all i had to do was execute i was dreaming of it honestly
5178856 only myth only narrative can capture the mystery of human goodness and evil
5178857 they were not taken hostage they remained unharmed but could not leave the place
5178858 that is why we cannot enter the area they milf are using the civilians as human shields
5178859 the rebels also shot a power transmission facility that caused a brownout
5178860 the recent milf perpetrated incidents in mindanao is a virtual declaration of war against the duly constituted authority
5178861 the afp shall not allow this to go on we are now taking military action to stop these atrocities these developments are clear manifestation of the insincerity to the peace process of a significant portion of the milf
5178862 we are actually conducting an offensive operation now against the groups
5178863 we just had a few hours into the fighting but let me just report to you that there is intense fighting in those local areas it has not escalated into a widespread scale outside lanao del norte but fighting is intense in those mentioned areas
5178864 i thought they were military men manning the checkpoint so i stopped
5178865 but as the bus was about to stop they started firing at us with automatic rifles as they chanted
5178866 my colleague sent me text messages saying they saw my bus with many dead
5178867 this is a problem that has to be dealt with whether or not there is a peace process
5178868 they acted on their own and we are doing our best to pacify him and restore normalcy
5178869 we have sent emissary to inform him his action was in violation of the ceasefire agreement
5178870 commander bravo would not launch attacks unless he is provoked
5178871 weve talked a few times since shes been in china

5178875 she said people had put pressure on her to use the property for the supply of drugs she said that she had in fact left the premises and had only returned to collect some personal items but when police called at the premises she was in the bath so detectives believed she had more of a connection to the house than she was letting on
5178876 she then went on and moved from cannabis to heroin and she was on bail for the previous heroin offence when caught she was clearly somebody who moved in those circles
5178877 she says the time she has spent in prison already has been useful she is 65 and she is now clean of drugs and has the offer of a property in peterborough when she leaves jail this is close enough for her to see her grandchildren and she hopes to make a fresh start
5178878 he suddenly raised one hand and whacked her round the face then did the same with the other
5178879 for people who commit offences of domestic violence causing these type of injuries only prison can be justified
5178880 im the boy you wanted to throw a lifeline to two nights ago remember
5178881 people say things at night they wouldnt necessarily say in daylight

5178883 we hope it will be a habit to start using the rails at these times
5178884 there was an iraq where kurdish entrepreneurs opened a knockoff version of mcdonalds and an iraq where jihadists slayed policemen beneath the kurdish golden arches
5178885 it will be a landmark by election it will be a deciding factor for anwar
5178886 i am touched by the overwhelming support it is no longer just a by election it is a lot more than that
5178887 it is a historic moment for malaysians especially the silent majority to convey how they want the nation to move ahead
5178888 and then i pretty much went back to my room and slept again for like two hours then i went back got some more nuggets
5178889 the shops will be shut down people will be partying in the streets

5178891 for one thing youll be able to come out to the bush and not hear generators humming and it will be clean power
5178892 the climate debate has focused an awful lot of interest on the commercial development of these resources
5178893 we have the hottest rocks in the world of this type
5178894 a business like this might even stand to make a profit
5178895 we set out with that the regular season title being a goal in the beginning of the year and to see it come to fruition today is a good feeling
5178896 water comes into play on 14 of the 18 holes on the course
5178897 liu xiang would never have pulled out unless the pain was intolerable and he had no other option
5178898 that is the thing when you see the crowd you realise why he had to come out
5178899 we worked hard every day but the result was as you see and its really hard to take
5178900 the situation is grave and calls for urgent and critical engagement of all parties
5178901 we must step up our efforts to ensure that all emergency funds and supplies made available are utilized immediately and effectively to save human lives and put a stop to the epidemic
5178902 nigerian contractors have continued to play key roles in bonga since the field commenced operations in november 2005 as nigerias first deepwater production they have provided support in subsea engineering as well as operations and maintenance the bonga fpsos mooring buoy was fabricated by nigerdock a nigerian company in lagos measuring 23 metres in diameter and 12 metres in height and weighing approximately 870 tonnes bongas buoy was at the time of completion the largest most sophisticated facility of its kind in the world the expectation is that more nigerian companies will gain invaluable offshore experience and serve the deepwater industry for many years to come

5178904 for clarification no memo emanated from the leadership on the matter because there was no need to interfere unnecessarily with an issue that had already been settled at the executive session of the house

5178906 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5178907 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5178908 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5178909 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5178910 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5178911 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5178912 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5178913 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5178914 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5178915 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5178916 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5178917 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5178918 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5178919 bei uns gibt es noch vieles zu verbessern aber es war ganz wichtig mit den drei punkten in die saison zu starten
5178920 many people still assume that parenting ends when a child turns 18 but in our culture today there is a longer extension of adolescence
5178921 everything is not lost if you are the parent of a college student and trying to do a better job
5178922 if you are open and ready to listen to what they have to say that will help you build a stronger relationship
5178923 liu xiang has two injuries one in his foot and one in his leg one of the injuries is an accumulated injury
5178924 according to our information 35 people have died from both sides and more than three dozens were injured
5178925 we are facing a serious humanitarian crisis here people are running out of food and hospitals of the medicines because of the fighting which seems spreading to more villages
5178926 72 hours deadline to the warring tribesmen to stop the violence or face action
5178927 these people were killed when the helicopter gunships pounded the insurgents positions in the afternoon
5178928 we are here against the atrocities being committed over the people of kashmir for the last three days we are also here with the demand of the people that the srinagar muzaffarabad route should be opened and i very respectfully appeal to the people that they should act patiently
5178929 there have been lot of atrocities over people of kashmir for the last two days more than 40 kashmiri youths have been killed it was a general perception in the kashmir valley that double standards have been adopted police and army were quite patient in dealing with the violent protests of jammu
5178930 right now the temper needs to be cooled down and mutual trust needs to built in it because neither in the valley nor anywhere else in the country people even expected that jammu will have so much reaction
5178931 era una din acele seri in care purtam o rochie foarte str mta pe sub care nu puteai sa porti lenjerie intima din moment ce s ar fi vazut
5178932 im going to be as radical a social reformer as mrs thatcher was an economic reformer and radical social reform is what this country needs right now
5178933 margaret thatcher in her time realised that the big challenge was reviving britains economy and we should recognise that the challenge for the modern conservatives is reviving our society its dealing with the issues of family breakdown welfare dependency failing schools crime and the problems that we see in too many of our communities
5178934 im now at tottenham but no one can disagree with me wanting to follow my dream
5178935 if i had been laughing when i was on the bench people would say i was an idiot

5178940 they had tuberculosis scabies they needed surgery from prison fights
5178941 all the prisoners had full rights and lived peacefully it was like a city
5178942 outside this country people have much false information about our ways be careful what you write we can kill you
5178943 my boss would demand who was that girl you were talking to
5178944 saddam told me whenever he saw me if you want to marry a girl ill recommend some ladies you should marry three or four times if you marry three or four times you are a real man
5178945 they just disappeared all of a sudden we were ordered not to ask questions
5178946 id look at neighboring countries they lived quiet lives not what we were leading we were considered unwelcome all over the globe i wanted the situation to change i wanted iraq to be welcome in the world
5178947 there was something inside me when the americans were approaching i hoped the americans would make the situation better because i had in my mind that america was a civilized and progressive country americans were a people that did not allow injustice i thought america would change iraq into a country of dreams i thought it was true america would make iraq a model for the middle east i told myself let us bear the burden of these strikes
5178948 im sure the feelings i have now are what saddam has
5178949 they would arrest innocent people and torture them saddam didnt know about it no one would tell him what was going on when saddam knew he punished the wrongdoers saddam was only one man and iraqis are many
5178950 men will always stab you in the back but women will give you a beautiful life and make you happy
5178951 i told her i was a journalist and i started asking her questions for a story her age she answered twenty five married divorced with kids can you sneak out she answered i can say im on duty at the hospital
5178952 be accurate and precise because i like my sex precise and if you cant talk frank leave it keep in mind the story will not be published she answered my body sex temperature is 1000 percent fucked from front and behind
5178953 im a simple man but i am sure americans came to iraq without a plan they were just having a showdown with saddam they are not doing us any good they are hurting us
5178954 ill see you today probably this evening ill come to you my love my life my soul
5178955 i was sitting in my car she was walking with her mother she looked at me in a beautiful way she gazed at me she beckoned my attention i wrote my number on a piece of paper and dropped it by her she took it and i knew shed like to have an affair with me
5178956 i told her i was surprised because i didnt have affairs talking to her i warmed her up i could see she was responding after three phone calls i started talking to her in a sexy way i told her my problem is i like women and beautiful ladies i made clear to her im the sort of man who enjoys watching blue movies and satellite channels every day
5178957 terrorists are watching me i cant even trust my neighbors
5178958 they are on the street and sidewalk watching everyones movements
5178959 i ask them doesnt it bother you im so much older but they tell me i like a man of your age and personality who shows respect for ladies every day they wish to see me but the problem is i have no time
5178960 youre crazy maybe this is a plot and youre going to lose your life
5178961 i saw no future for myself under saddam life would have been tougher than it is now
5178962 if i have one day off in baghdad i feel myself lost i dont know where to go there are no places to have fun
5178963 i told her i loved her but she started saying my family wants this wants that and then i felt she wasnt in love with me i felt lost
5178964 iraqi girls want to marry for stability theyre not really in love they just want to get rid of problems
5178965 to this moment when i hear an american was shot or killed in a bombing i feel very sad i havent changed a bit about this i can say the americans are not that bad god gave us this gift people should not forget the situation under saddam then they could not speak out about anything there was no freedom they should remember how the baath were how they humiliated people
5178966 sometimes i feel my sunni friends are happy when americans are killed and they dont care a bit about the civilians who died in a bombing that a mother and father died they are happy about these things they dont really look at whats going on they admire how brave the resistance is i discuss this with my friends but then we reach a point and we dont go any further
5178967 after 20 years there has been a flood like this we have suffered a huge loss the government is doing nothing
5178968 the recent blasts in our embassy in kabul have cast a shadow over our efforts to normalize relations with pakistan and to bring a lasting and honourable peace in our region
5178969 the terrorists and those who support them are enemies of the people of india and pakistan of friendship between the two countries and of peace in the region and the world
5178970 the time for meaningful engagement with pakistan is perhaps over for this government because pakistan is unlikely to resolve its internal political consolidation in the short run
5178971 i dont think we have an option but to engage with the pakistani government
5178972 despite some recent violations along the line of control the ceasefire between our countries is still holding if we stop engaging with pakistan it could lead to the derailing the peace process and i dont think that would serve our purpose better
5178973 it was a very balanced and good speech it was reconciliatory not confrontationist and showed the respect he has for the government and people of pakistan
5178974 creo que la mayor a de los partidos est n de acuerdo en que esa cuesti n hay que solucionarla en que el problema lo cre el se or zapatero y por tanto creo que no va a haber ning n problema en que se le obligue a comparecer
5178975 lo que no puede hacer un presidente del gobierno es dar un cheque sin fondos y se es el l o que nos ha montado y ahora tenemos un l o importante que tiene que explicar proclam lo que no puede hacer es tirar la piedra y esconder la mano y en eso es experto el se or zapatero
5178976 tiene problemas con el psc que parece que ya no es partido y con el se or montilla
5178977 the president will address the nation at 1 00pm 0700 gmt
5178978 he is a wise man he is a very experienced man and he has seen the writing on the wall
5178979 he has seen the sentiments of not just the elected representatives but various institutions who all asked him to move in a particular way and do not destabilise things here
5178980 his political fate has been sealed whatever he says doesnt matter
5178981 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan

5178994 they came they did the work they allowed the movie to be finished they didnt take money the money goes to heaths daughter thats extraordinary
5178995 i am so glad these guys are so humble thats why they make a great addition to the film it will be bittersweet seeing this movie knowing he was filming it only days before he died this picture still hurts to see because as we all know he did die a couple of days after this picture was taken my thoughts will always be with heath
5178996 you have to swish it around with your spit or it just gets crazy

5178998 katy knows how i feel we are a very outspoken family and she knows how disappointed her father and i are i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
5178999 katy is our daughter and we love her but we strongly disagree with how she is conducting herself at the moment

5179012 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5179013 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5179014 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5179015 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5179016 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5179017 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5179018 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5179019 but they understand when somebody has an accident you cannot help it

5179021 we worked hard every day but the result was as you see and it is really hard to take
5179022 it is the end of the achilles tendon in his right foot
5179023 im afraid he wont be able to compete before the end of the year he can barely walk he was in tears and he is very depressed
5179024 even though he felt pain he decided to compete in the first heat
5179025 liu would not withdraw unless the pain was intolerable and there was no other way out
5179026 when you see the crowd you realize why he had to come out
5179027 we have taken an mri and the problem is in his tendon
5179028 lius bone in his foot is different from ordinary people it is larger and it has developed into a hard bump
5179029 we dont know when he was hurt but it has been a problem for six or seven years
5179030 it was a problem before the athens games and the injury has been back and forth since it was the main problem with todays performance
5179031 the track is perfect anything is possible in the final
5179032 it would get the bad news out of the way quickly and gordon could use his conference speech to rally support whats the point of a relaunch in september if the impact is completely snuffed out in october
5179033 you know ive heard from an army captain who was the head of a rifle platoon supposed to have 39 men in a rifle platoon
5179034 ended up being sent to afghanistan with 24 because 15 of those soldiers had been sent to iraq and as a consequence they didnt have enough ammunition they didnt have enough humvees they were actually capturing taliban weapons because it was easier to get taliban weapons than it was for them to get properly equipped by our current commander in chief
5179035 the purpose of going after the taliban was not to get their weapons
5179036 they were actually capturing taliban weapons because it was easier to get taliban weapons than it was for them to get properly equipped by our current commander in chief

5179040 dino gave me a big book of the italian version of flash gordon the comic book a nice coffee table book all in italian thats what he liked you know the italian comic book and it started like that but its impossible to exaggerate the importance of danilo donati the designer he was the one who really set the whole movie the tone of it and everything and dino had great reverence for him hes a wonderful designer and worked with fellini and others
5179041 for me it was an adventure i knew little about flash gordon being brought up in the uk and even less about special effects i was going in a learning curve as steep as the films hero
5179042 dino is very adamant about casting the inherent characteristics or being loyal to the actual physical look of the originals in other words if you look at a picture of me at the age of 25 and you look at a picture of buster crabbe at the age of 25 i mean we look like brothers we really look like brothers so i had that going for me as well im not sure how many but there were a few other actors that he had flown to the screen test i dont know how many times they put me on film tested me i tested and then i found out a couple of days later that they were going to hire me as the lead
5179043 i flew from new york immediately out to london and to be casted the moment i arrived no sleep time at all and as soon as i arrived they whisked me off dyed my hair black and for some reason decided to shave the front of my head so my hair would look like a wig and i thought why dont you just get a wig and it was all fast and tiring and i remember i was in tears by the end of the day
5179044 well when i was a kid we used to go to saturday morning pictures in the cinemas
5179045 many years ago when i was a child in yorkshire england in south yorkshire near sheffield there were two cinemas
5179046 the problems were never artistic problems i was there the whole time but there were constant production problems and thats what most of the problems were dino wanted things cut down or this and that and it was unlike the stuff that mike had ever done it was a huge really out of control production and the thing had to be made to fit the set thats really what happened when we were shooting and dino especially had no idea what he wanted he wanted something flash gordon and i adored dino but he didnt have much idea about the difference between sort of camp and star wars people expected a much more realistic movie obviously
5179047 what i like about timothy is that he has doubts
5179048 and it the set was full of dwarfs and all kinds of people i love dwarfs theyre the happiest people in the world and i loved to chase them around the set and stuff like that so the whole thing was colossal fun i mean everything i did took one take and so forth i remember one particular point because when i landed on my rocket i had a great bazooka of course its made of cardboard and they got all the dynamite ready for that scene for three days they got all the special effects ready my 2 000 hawkmen flew in and i said come on flash follow me and i started firing all over the place pow pow pow and doing that with my mouth pow pow pow pow pow and they said cut cut cut brian we put in the special effects
5179049 well we were aware that this hadnt been done before
5179050 he will come round i dont think we had much hope but whatever mike said to mr de laurentiis later on a couple of days later we heard that it was all okayed
5179051 when flash and dale are unconscious in the rocket at the beginning the music thats quiet where theyre both sweating in the sea of fire inside the rocket is so romantic and nostalgic and ethereal and when hes about to die flash and be gassed that tableaux that whole scene with the drums beating and the lovely green and red and purple sky in the background its the most wonderful tableaux the music again is sensational
5179052 so for the title track i wanted to portray the cartoon like quality that i saw in it but the soaring guitars were just the normal vocabulary of my dreams of course as soon as any one of us presented an idea the other members of queen would rush in and help build it a lot of the style of it is due to the way roger taylor and john deacon played it and the way freddie mercury interpreted the vocal
5179053 the director and the writer and the producer didnt know how to end that scene sam looked up and said oh i know run the camera and this machine came forward and you think its going to kill him look out flash and it says hail flash gordon savior of the universe and sam just jumped up in the air and went yeah and that was it it was so simple and so pure and its very very difficult i think sam is the definitive flash gordon because he is so pure
5179054 dino didnt quite get the irony piece of it he got upset when some people would watch the dailies and would be laughing hed say this is flash gordon this is a serious movie why are you laughing and it was written to be exactly what it was which was high camp and it was very very big among the whole warhol group and downtown and actually we were a huge hit throughout europe and asia it was for whatever reasons political reasons between dino and universal they really didnt promote it in america that much but they had cardboard figures of us up and down the shelves every day in paris in europe it was very successful i dont know what happened but they did not promote it in the u s as they did overseas and in asia where it was just a huge hit
5179055 im not surprised its become a cult movie it had all the ingredients when we made it besides ming the merciless being more prominent on the poster much of sams dialogue on screen was dubbed by an unknown actor since he wasnt allowed
5179056 dino and i talked about two years ago and i had to do it i had to call him i felt like there was this weight on my shoulders and i decided to call him and say hey dino first of all i just want to tell you it was a major blessing working for you all those years ago and i feel like theres been this weight on my shoulders all this time that we had some rift between us and i just wanted to set things straight that i wanted to thank you for bringing me in i had a great time if theres anything thats still pending between us i just want to tell you that im sorry for any problems on my part or my team of attorneys and he was cool he said imitating dinos thick italian accent oh okay saaam its oookayyy saaammm he has that voice anyway i just felt that there was a freedom and a peace with that because when youre young and you have sometimes seconds or minutes to make a major decision if you dont have advisors with you who you trust who you know are really looking out for your best interests sometimes youll go with your best instinct and even though your best instinct may be correct wisdom and history repeats itself where you need to seek counsel on certain things and at that time i wish i had certain counsel and its always good especially now because im 52 years old now its always good to have a humble spirit even though you may be 100 right and everybody else wrong if you go into it with a spirit of arrogance and attitude youre still wrong for making that decision without seeking the rights and without walking with humility and i think at that time i assessed everything weeded out and if i had to it do over again yes i would seek counsel not from maybe a team of attorneys that wanted to get a piece of dino but from somebody who was wise
5179057 we rent space on scotts database to showcase images and provide images to clients

5179061 it was brand new and in the box worth 100 000
5179062 i paid 10 cents on the dollar it had 300 gigabytes worth of storage back then that was gargantuan
5179063 earlier this year i moved 12 gigabytes of images to sports illustrated in just over 2 hours

5179079 with no suggestion that this has imposed an excessive strain on the assemblys more limited resources and certainly no claim that the system is being swamped
5179080 it is very hard to draw conclusions from a one month number especially in these uncertain times but the numbers in the pacific east and west north central divisions may be good signs

5179095 there is absolutely no excuse for banks not to pass an official rate cut from the reserve bank in full should that occur absolutely no excuse
5179096 it may be interesting to see whether there was any discussion about the size of rate cuts and their relationship to bank lending rates which seem to have become the interest rates that the rba has become most interested in for policy purposes
5179097 in recent times the cost of borrowing money short term has come down and that is a considerable benefit to the banks

5179134 the spouses union achieves the twofold end of marriage the good of the spouses themselves and the transmission of life

5179138 who decides to have a baby out of wedlock by means of a sperm donation is unbelievably cruel

5179140 a woman who does this is not fit to be a mother for any human creature
5179141 there is no such thing as a single parent family just like there is no square that is a circle a family consists of a father mother and children
5179142 the two fundamental criteria for moral discernment in this field are unconditional respect for the human being as a person from conception to natural death and respect for the origin of the transmission of human life through the acts of the spouses

5179145 everyone save for mum thought i should have an abortion
5179146 my dad even made an appointment at the clinic and they showed me the little blob on the scan i presume to convince me that it was just a mass of cells and the whole thing would be over quickly
5179147 anyone my age would want to have a baby rather than an abortion
5179148 i did and i dont regret it for a moment
5179149 having her in my life is such a joy from the first time i held her in my arms i have had this fierce bond with her a connection which started even before she was born she looks like me when i was her age and i feel strongly that she was meant to be a part of our family

5179151 pro life 101 a step by step guide to making your case persuasively
5179152 how should a civil society treat innocent human beings that remind us of a painful event may we kill them so that we can feel better put differently can you think of any other case where having been victimized yourself you can justly turn around and victimize another completely innocent person
5179153 if the unborn is a human being she should not be killed to benefit her mother hardship does not justify homicide hence we are back to the one question that trumps all others in the abortion debate what is the unborn
5179154 it was as if i could hear the echoes of all those people who with the most sympathetic of tones would say well except in cases of rape or who would rather fervently exclaim in disgust especially is cases of rape all these people are out there who dont even know me but are standing in judgment of my life so quick to dismiss it just because of how i was conceived i felt like i was now going to have to justify my own existence

5179229 when we found the contamination it was another sign that the way we currently manufacture heparin is simply unsafe unlike the current heparin that is harvested from possibly disease carrying animals in often very poor conditions our fully synthetic heparin will be created in a pharmaceutical manufacturing environment from fermentation to packaging this will give drug manufacturers extreme control over the safety and purity of the product

5179244 but if ive learned anything over the last two years its that life with cancer is tough

5179298 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
5179299 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5179300 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
5179301 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
5179302 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
5179303 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
5179304 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
5179305 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
5179306 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
5179307 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
5179308 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
5179309 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
5179310 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention

5179327 some of the greatest memories from meets like this are the times spent with teammates
5179328 there were a lot of rookies on the mens team some of them i didnt really know as well as others playing spades playing risk relaxing and getting to know everyone on the team being part of team usa and the olympic team is one of the greatest memories i will take from this
5179329 i was really nervous i wanted to take it out strong and come home as strong as i could

5179342 we are concerned about the phenomena of burn out among experienced investigators who have left the office since 2005
5179343 there are simply not enough to handle the rigorous demands of these investigations and there is the perception that their efforts are not sufficiently valued
5179344 i have a strong case that is why i am appealing the judgement
5179345 i came out of the press conference in a state of shock
5179346 he painted a picture no scholar would recognise he was basically calling for regime change making a political statement which is surprising coming from the chief prosecutor of the icc
5179347 by presenting his case in such stark terms the prosecutor has made it easy for his critics to dismiss him as ill informed and driven by a desire for publicity and has made it harder for the advocates of justice in darfur to pursue the challenge of calling to account those responsible for crimes no less heinous than genocide

5179350 no doubt there is a feeling in the country in favor of democrats in general

5179352 the pace of dollar appreciation versus the euro is too fast

5179375 there is absolutely no excuse for banks not to pass an official rate cut from the reserve bank in full should that occur absolutely no excuse
5179376 it may be interesting to see whether there was any discussion about the size of rate cuts and their relationship to bank lending rates which seem to have become the interest rates that the rba has become most interested in for policy purposes
5179377 in recent times the cost of borrowing money short term has come down and that is a considerable benefit to the banks

5179410 if we had been as inventive as we were today we could have beaten birmingham last week
5179411 that team deserved to keep playing though and i wasnt going to change it not a lot of teams will be able to handle us if we play like that
5179412 ive got a job on to get back into that side
5179413 he will do a weeks hard running and if everything goes to plan he will start football work on monday week i thought we wouldnt see him on the training pitch until the end of september but he could be back in contention by the end of august
5179414 strikers are at a premium and as long as he realises what hes about hard work getting in the box and finishing chances billy sharp can be whatever he wants to be
5179415 things were not going great last season when the new manager arrived but the fact that hes shown faith in me has made me have more faith in myself just to get a place in this team with so many other top class strikers here is an achievement so if i want to stay in the team the goals will have to keep coming
5179416 his all round play apart from in the box was the best i have seen from him
5179417 they showed in the second half the quality they have on the ball now they just have to settle down and get used to the system
5179418 we were 2 0 down after 13 minutes and had a mountain to climb
5179419 it will take time for some of our foreign players to settle everyone was on cristiano ronaldos back when he first came to this country it takes time to adjust
5179420 it could have been even worse for the london side the shaky cerny did well to hold stephen quinns volley and was fortunate to see sub danny webber fire wide from hendersons lay off
5179421 lets not overreact to one defeat we had a mad 20 minutes where we didnt defend set pieces properly but i felt we came into it more in the second half
5179422 ive always said we may need a goalscorer but apart from that i dont see the need to go and panic buy before the end of the transfer window we have the ability to make the dream come true
5179423 after people were already dead they came back again and started shooting again at them

5179431 it is within our ministers south african home affairs minister mapisa nqakula powers to declare groups of people as refugees for a period of time
5179432 this would assist us in processing the large numbers of southern africans who are mostly zimbabweans approaching our centre
5179433 we have to take each case one by one that is why we are unable to keep up with demand we can process between 300 and 400 people a day but this is not enough in the face of the large numbers
5179434 what is needed is a regional solution in which people are given some sort of sadc status it has been talked about but repeatedly blocked by countries like south africa more bilateral agreements on movement from one country to another are definitely needed
5179435 the six month status under that initiative is fairly clear and it only applies to people in the safety camps set up to house victims of the recent xenophobia while i think there is a need for some sort of protection for these people in the case of this id scheme we would be back in the same situation in six months and i dont see them home affairs developing a longer term strategy
5179436 two and a half years since the start of the refugee backlog project we see the same chaos we the assessment team first experienced when joining home affairs in september 2005 with a new backlog larger than the one that has just been effectively cleared
5179437 when i arrived in may 2008 we were only taking in 50 applicants a day and now we have brought that up to between 300 and 400 so progress is being made but the whole process is in transition and it is not helped by the fact that on thursdays and fridays we are quite literally swamped by between 2 500 and 3 500 zimbabweans who are seeking asylum
5179438 while i am impatient to see changes happening faster than they are you cant skip stages for the sake of expediency it is important to bring everyone along as we move forward and as we move forward we need to cement in place what is behind us so that others can use it as a template

5179447 we are calling on minister wong to accept a real climate change solution and end logging of mature old growth and high conservation value forests we are extremely concerned that minister wong who is charged with the important task of steering australia down a low carbon path is pandering to wood chipping and old growth logging interests whose activities have been shown to pose a major climate impact
5179448 a recent report by australias national university has highlighted the immense carbon storage potential of undisturbed native forests and the vital role forest protection can play in our climate change solution
5179449 the old growth logging industry has buried its heads in the sand rejected this scientific research and denied that logging natural forests exacerbates climate change yet forestry tasmanias own data shows that their management will lead to a loss of 28 percent of the carbon stored in commercial forests between 2007 and 2030 a crucial window of opportunity to stop climate change

5179491 we chose evts open architecture approach as it offers most flexibility and scalability when it comes to providing customers with one platform that consolidates all of their video surveillance solutions
5179492 evts advanced integration tools provide a wide range of surveillance solutions when it comes to ip cameras video encoders and especially video analytics like the securator ix
5179493 the video surveillance market in western europe offers a huge commercial potential for flexible video management platforms that provide endless scalability and adjustability to diverse market needs
5179494 intronics unique mix of know how logistic excellence and added value makes it a valuable partner for evt as it grows in this market
5179495 endace interface cards and monitoring platforms are particularly well suited to government agencies because they run a wide range of custom and open source security and performance monitoring applications
5179496 endace offers the only open platforms capable of making every packet on a 10 gigabit link available for simultaneous analysis by multiple monitoring applications as a result endace technology is increasingly part of agency rfps for managed network services provided by telecommunications carriers and for network infrastructure installed by systems integrators our expanded sales and systems engineering support capabilities will also ensure that our federal solutions are well designed for trouble free installation and operation
5179497 operators of government networks are eager to gain the same visibility and control over their networks as their counterparts who manage the physical security of agency facilities just as video cameras continuously monitor location entrances and exits endace technology makes it practical to apply the same principle to an agencys data network we can capture and monitor all traffic coming and going across the network edge and to every critical network resource
5179498 the successful completion of our first three year plan has put us in a good position for the future we have eight promising partner companies and we believe each has the potential to meet our minimum goal of a company valuation in excess of us 100 million
5179499 during the reporting period amphion continued to generate strong nav and revenue growth and to raise money for its partner companies despite the current turmoil in the financial and credit markets
5179500 we believe that all eight partner companies could be revenue generating by the early part of next year which together with the potential for further licensing income from datatern will mean that a larger part of the groups future funding needs can be generated internally
5179501 although we anticipate along with the wider market a challenging business environment for the coming year we remain focused on creating substantial value for our shareholders by a systematic application of a tried and tested methodology for building great companies from promising and proprietary intellectual property

5179503 twiki is a leading edge web based collaboration tool specialized for corporate intranet use twiki fosters information flow within a company and eliminates the one webmaster syndrome of outdated intranet content
5179504 we wont get our hands dirty with it we cant let you tweak it on the network because it could hurt the rest of the system
5179505 someone just mentioned theyd like to turn over their twiki installation to their network management group but the group wouldnt take it on until it could be shown that twiki could be completely administrated from the web
5179506 currently our it guys wouldnt support this with a bargepole since it requires too much hands on administration
5179507 the style of weblogs is very linear it lends itself well to news diaries and interesting findings on the web but it is less suitable for long term goal oriented discussion of a subject or collaborative content creation
5179508 going oo requires another rewrite of twiki however it should be possible to do the change into oo gradually reusing most of the available libraries using a
5179509 refactoring is one way of moving the code base towards a more structured basis i think though that this will be extremely tricky as given the current interdependances between certain code units in the code any change to say the storage system requires multiple changes to various other aspects of the search and rendering units

5179515 this is my body if you dont eat it you have no life in you
5179516 drink from it all of you for this is my blood of the covenant which will be shed on behalf of many for the forgiveness of sins
5179517 this is my blood of the covenant which will be shed for many
5179518 i have eagerly desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer for i tell you i shall not eat it again until there is fulfillment in the kingdom of god
5179519 take this and share it among yourselves for i tell you that from this time on i shall not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god comes
5179520 this is my body which will be given for you do this in memory of me
5179521 this cup is the new covenant in my blood which will be shed for you
5179522 are you the only visitor to jerusalem who does not know of the things that have taken place there in these days
5179523 the things that happened to jesus the nazarene who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people how our chief priests and rulers both handed him over to a sentence of death and crucified him but we were hoping that he would be the one to redeem israel and besides all this it is now the third day since this took place some women from our group however have astounded us they were at the tomb early in the morning and did not find his body they came back and reported that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who announced that he was alive then some of those with us went to the tomb and found things just as the women had described but him they did not see
5179524 oh how foolish you are how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets spoke was it not necessary that the messiah should suffer these things and enter into his glory
5179525 stay with us for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over
5179526 were not our hearts burning within us while he spoke to us on the way and opened the scriptures to us
5179527 the lord has truly been raised and has appeared to simon
5179528 how can this man give us his flesh to eat
5179529 amen amen i say to you unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you do not have life within you
5179530 this is my body that is for you do this in remembrance of me
5179531 this cup is the new covenant in my blood do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me
5179532 let no one eat and drink of your eucharist but those baptized in the name of the lord to this too the saying of the lord is applicable do not give to dogs what is sacred
5179533 since then these things are manifest to us and we have looked into the depths of the divine knowledge we ought to do in order all things which the master commanded us to perform at appointed times he commanded us to celebrate sacrifices and services and that it should not be thoughtlessly or disorderly but at fixed times and hours he has himself fixed by his supreme will the places and persons whom he desires for these celebrations in order that all things may be done piously according to his good pleasure and be acceptable to his will so then those who offer their oblations at the appointed seasons are acceptable and blessed but they follow the laws of the master and do not sin for to the high priest his proper ministrations are allotted and to the priests the proper place has been appointed and on levites their proper services have been imposed the layman is bound by the ordinances for the laity
5179534 take care then who belong to god and to jesus christ they are with the bishop and those who repent and come to the unity of the church they too shall be of god and will be living according to jesus christ do not err my brethren if anyone follow a schismatic he will not inherit the kingdom of god if any man walk about with strange doctrine he cannot lie down with the passion take care then to use one eucharist so that whatever you do you do according to god for there is one flesh of our lord jesus christ and one cup in the union of his blood one altar as there is one bishop with the presbytery and my fellow servants the deacons
5179535 god has therefore announced in advance that all the sacrifices offered in his name which jesus christ offered that is in the eucharist of the bread and of the chalice which are offered by us christians in every part of the world are pleasing to him
5179536 you ought to know what you have received what you are going to receive and what you ought to receive daily that bread which you see on the altar having been sanctified by the word of god is the body of christ the chalice or rather what is in that chalice having been sanctified by the word of god is the blood of christ

5179538 finding statistically robust associations linked to two proteins that may be involved in regulating such ion channels and that are also thought to be targets of drugs used to clinically to treat bipolar disorder is astonishing
5179539 faced with little agreement among previous studies searching for the genomic hot spots in bipolar disorder these researchers pooled their data for maximal statistical power and unearthed surprising results improved understanding of these abnormalities could lead to new hope for the millions of americans affected by bipolar disorder
5179540 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimise for those properties
5179541 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5179542 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modelling can do
5179543 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution

5179546 the scene was very tragic the aircraft had come down in the woods there was a clearing where it crashed through
5179547 it was upside down and the top of the roof was crushed one of the engines was some distance away
5179548 it was really very difficult to get into the aircraft we were having to rip off the skin with our hands
5179549 the twin engined aircraft was on quite a low approach to coventry on the normal land path when a smaller aircraft came from the right and the twin engined aircraft struck it side on
5179550 the smaller plane disintegrated immediately and the right engine of the twin aircraft blew up
5179551 whilst we watched the twin engined aircraft bank steeply to the left with smoke coming from its right engine it seemed to level off and climb slightly before dropping steeply down to the left
5179552 i immediately thought it looked like something was wrong then at the last minute just 50 feet up the pilot managed to pull up the nose of the plane
5179553 it looked like he was trying to save the plane from the trees
5179554 but then i realised that the plane was going down and it disappeared into the woods
5179555 it was weird because there was no bang i couldnt believe what i had seen
5179556 two of them were not only commercial pilots but they were also fully qualified instructors they had many many thousands of hours of flying time between them
5179557 it is an absolute tragedy for us because we are a small company we are like a family we know everyone extremely well our thoughts and prayers are with the families
5179558 it had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry
5179559 it was approximately two miles from the runway we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft
5179560 it was a very very routine piece of work and the plane was about to land in a normal routine fashion

5179562 we will work on accomplishing it within the coming weeks
5179563 such a decision will be followed by some logistical measures which need to be taken by both countries in order to put the agreement into effect
5179564 the ones we know about have committed criminal offenses in syria
5179565 we inquired about other people and we are still waiting for a response from syrian officials
5179566 later the cabinet will issue a separate decree for an embassy in syria
5179567 then all that remains in front of us are procedural steps which the two foreign ministries will be tasked with taking
5179568 the syrians do not need an embassy to operate in lebanon they have their intelligence as well as their allies
5179569 referring the issue of lebanese prisoners in syrian jails to committees is equivalent to killing it we all know that forming committees will not help in resolving the issue
5179570 demarcating borders in the shebaa farms area will help liberate the occupied territory whereas excluding it aims at creating pretexts for hizbullah to hold on to its arms
5179571 we are not saying that to turn our back to discussing a defense strategy for lebanon but to say that there are other important issues which need to be discussed during national dialogue sessions
5179572 we need to address economic and social issues as well as ways to implement the decisions that were taken during earlier dialogue sessions

5179578 we want to withdraw all the troops from the areas near the preah vihear temple clear the mines there and finally plant border demarcation posts between the two countries
5179579 we will discuss step by step to withdraw the troops there and end the problem in the near future

5179591 you have to hear the responses inside the shin bet to the release they work day and night to capture and neutralize terrorists and all of it is gone in an instant
5179592 people in the shin bet end up asking why do we capture these people
5179593 a terrorist who plants an explosive device gets 10 years in prison but will end up being released after three or four years this hurts the motivation in the shin bet
5179594 the government realized it could not do a southern hostage deal so it went with the northern hostage deal to reduce public pressure on it
5179595 hamas is demanding 450 heavyweight prisoners who took part in recent terrorist attacks the memories of the victims families are still very raw i dont believe the government can go ahead with this
5179596 on the morning after the release we heard fatah blaming israel whatever happens they will blame israel and fault everyone except for themselves
5179597 the aim of the release is also to show the americans and europeans that we are open minded and that we are helping out the side that we are supposed to be helping
5179598 in the short term this is not a risk the aksa martyrs brigades have been neutralized by the pa for the time being
5179599 but what many in israel do not realize is that while these terrorists may not go back to fighting many will go back to indoctrinating others into terrorism and creating a terror supporting environment
5179600 some will recruit on campuses others will become so called journalists while others will be integrated into institutions or sent abroad these jobs are meant to compensate them for the alleged suffering they underwent in prisons in israel

5179604 im just feeling that its not closure i dont use that word closure
5179605 i feel an end of a journey and i feel that for the gillespie family for johns sisters and brothers that its just most important that we have finally come to this stage to say that weve finally got him home
5179606 we worked together and look what it achieved weve got him home as the words on the plaque say home at last

5179618 maybe we play him up the ground a little bit to try to take him out of that zone to make us a little bit less buddy conscious

5179628 gang affiliation is cultural in so much that young people involved with gangs often have family members involved with gangs
5179629 when families move you can assume that the gangs will follow
5179630 there was a big emphasis on stopping gang activity giving our young folks things to do like sports and education we banded together and had great success
5179631 i could support changing the program but it is important they have something in comin ups place
5179632 its not like opening a 7 eleven on the corner you have to find the right place
5179633 if gangs are becoming more of an issue its important we know about it
5179634 this is another example of the influence that rich special interests and their well connected lobbyists have on the political process and one more reason its time to change the way government works

5179638 i think the pacific island forum will see this is as a positive development building on the nz experience
5179639 very many of the pacific nation countries have indicated their own interest to me as they have to other of my colleagues
5179640 the nz experience has been that returning home has not been a problem
5179641 this is largely because the people involved regard it of considerable advantage to have that opportunity and they dont want to squander the opportunity in the future
5179642 but we are ensuring that very rigorous procedures and requirements will apply both in terms of the people that come and the conditions that both employers and employees must satisfy
5179643 gin adds flavor and a depth and complexity that isnt there with vodka
5179644 today we recognise the service of lance corporal john gillespie a husband a father a grandfather a mate
5179645 there is no higher calling in our land than to wear the uniform of australia
5179646 today as prime minister of australia i say a grateful nation thanks you the veterans of vietnam for your service to australia
5179647 im just feeling that its not closure i dont use that word closure
5179648 i feel an end of a journey and i feel that for the gillespie family for johns sisters and brothers that its just most important that we have finally come to this stage to say that weve finally got him home
5179649 we worked together and look what it achieved weve got him home as the words on the plaque say home at last
5179650 a lot of the ceremonies are very difficult for us but when we have time to reflect and actually come back when its quiet weve got special places to go and remember him
5179651 we try to have a bit more of an even balance and normally we do so hopefully we can keep that a little bit more even
5179652 we probably dont use mark williams anywhere near enough as well
5179653 were not going to win enough games of footy with stats like 17 and one
5179654 were a team orientated team and hes franklin doing the right thing
5179655 its not his fault were kicking it to him so much its our fault for making the wrong decisions going inside 50
5179656 maybe we play him up the ground a little bit to try to take him out of that zone to make us a little bit less buddy conscious
5179657 we had our best side out there and we just werent good enough to get the points
5179658 so were going to have to improve our form and individually were going to have to get better if were going to go all right in the finals
5179659 people drink when times are good and people drink when times are bad
5179660 id be liar if i said there hadnt been a softening theres no doubt retail is finding it harder than usual but that just means we have to work harder
5179661 the realism in the players movements in the wii format should be raising concerns about the impact of the game playing on the player

5179671 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5179672 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5179673 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5179674 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5179675 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5179676 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5179677 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5179684 was like he was saying i wish you hadnt told me that
5179685 they wouldnt hear us out theyd hear the first part of our answer and walk away
5179686 i cant go down there and help and i was really looking forward to gaining the experience
5179687 i can tell you theres tons of work to do there
5179688 thats what those two canadian women could have helped offer the border guards stopped that from happening stopped someones life from being changed down in the south
5179689 i knew nothing about male breast cancer even the fact that men could get breast cancer
5179690 if it is detected early you have a great chance of recovery the same as women wagner said
5179691 unfortunately men more often than not are not caught early
5179692 they wont go to a doctor men are notorious for not seeking out medical help let alone normal problems but they are not going to talk about a breast problem
5179693 i said the guy in cincinnati said its nothing to worry about in a matter of five minutes i was scheduled for a mammogram
5179694 i now know what hot flashes are mood swings depression is part of it too
5179695 any change anything that looks different any change in any area of the breast
5179696 get in to see a doctor right away have it looked at and get a second opinion
5179697 it is only a piece of flesh for men it is much more difficult for women
5179698 very few schools in the district will gain funds in fact the vast majority of schools in the area will lose funds
5179699 this model will hit small schools country schools and those with a high student turnover so schools in this area will be affected
5179700 under this new model a school would need the funding from about 15 extra students before a new class can be made
5179701 schools would therefore have to distribute 14 students among existing classes which would see class sizes increase dramatically
5179702 payment is an issue but we are concerned about the future state of schools in terms of class sizes the lack of funding and the possible loss of librarians
5179703 if the schools lose funding some brilliant programs could go to the wayside which would be quite sad

5179710 we can today confirm that we have advised the metropolitan police service that the actor christian bale should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
5179711 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
5179712 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
5179713 beyonces getting double teamed to give in and get pregnant

5179720 the coalition forces invaded afghanistan and we know that women are very important to the forces that invaded afghanistan
5179721 our women and common people are important to us too about one month ago the coalition forces attacked a wedding in jalalabad that killed 49 people women children men boys everyone that was present
5179722 to take revenge on the coalition forces and foreign people and to show the world that our people are just as important as yours
5179723 traditionally badal or revenge has been one of the mainstays of the pashtunwali code or the way of the pashtun
5179724 so its not at all surprising to me that the taliban would use revenge as justification for the killing of the aid workers
5179725 afghanistan has to try to have good relations with you but if your government continues a reversed policy the afghans will be obliged to kill your nationals in revenge for their brothers their sisters and their children
5179726 events such as logar will happen again because occupied afghanistan looks at all actors that are established in the interest of america with an eye of hostility
5179727 this letter is a disgusting attempt to justify the deliberate killings of innocent civilians there is no justification for these killings by the taliban
5179728 canada is in afghanistan at the request of the democratically elected government of that country canadians are part of a un sanctioned nato led coalition that is attempting to bring stability and security to the people of afghanistan we will continue to fight for these goals we will continue to protect the afghan people from these ruthless killers
5179729 the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans
5179730 they have to know that the canadian forces under american command handicap tens among the afghan people every day to this kind of condolence and they kill in addition to men numbers of women and children as well
5179731 rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghans to please the fascist regime of america your government did not take into account the national interests of canada and did not follow a neutral policy it sacrificed its national and international respect and standing in service of the interests of america
5179732 this is not a problem for us because this man is the same slave of the foreigners
5179733 we dont care about raufi we are not happy but we are not worried about this if the foreigners send more soldiers we dont care they have sent many brave commanders to fight us but we dont care
5179734 there should be no slot remedy i dont see how it could be justified
5179735 there is no rational basis for us to give up slots
5179736 we were keen to produce a type of video that was in sync with our market and wanted to shoot the properties as they were in a totally realistic fashion without staging any of the shots the videos form a major part of our ongoing quality assurance drive the aim of the exercise after all isnt to create a glossy sales video but to be totally transparent and allow our customers to see more of what a propertys actually like before they book it
5179737 hostelbookers videos on tripadvisor provide valuable content for our younger demographic by giving them a behind the scenes look at accommodations for budget travellers shot with a camera phone travellers benefit from a real view of the properties allowing them to select what best suits their needs
5179738 makes it the only place on the internet where the complete holiday travel experience from the customers home town to the hotel around resort and back home again can be booked
5179739 customers are now able to book the best priced rail deals available as part of their entire holiday experience on starting with the domestic train to international travel and then the car hire for the journey to the hotel

5179868 she met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing
5179869 but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out
5179870 both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5179871 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship
5179872 apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
5179873 by now lindsay was sending i love you notes to samantha and signing them lindsay ronson but telling courtenay she loved her too
5179874 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up
5179875 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha
5179876 every time she sees a picture of them together it kills her
