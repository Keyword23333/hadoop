7460049 to remember those who died in this bloodthirsty attack by a criminal georgian regime against our people
7460050 we are going to be an independent state inside russia its so logical
7460051 as we can see there has been extensive indiscriminate shelling of civilian targets in tskhinvali serious violations have been committed here by the georgian side
7460052 it was terrifying when the georgians came we hid for days in the shelter we lost family members and when we came out we found we had lost our roof too they are evil people to have done this done this to simple people like us
7460053 that happened to my head but look what they did to my house

7460183 earlier we were facing much hardship since we couldnt afford to buy the chemical fertilizers as they were too costly since the time we have been associated with chetna bharti basanti has taught us how to produce manure using earthworms since then we are rearing earthworms and using these as a catalyst in production of rich compost for our fields many villagers even buy the manure from us at rupees six per kilogram so much so we also sell a quintal or two to chetna bharti this way we make a decent earning for our daily bread as well as educate our kids

7460201 we started cultivating crops like brinjal and potato but we did not benefit much after getting information about the hybrid seeds we cultivated that when we used to cultivate brinjal and tomato the crop used to get damaged we have now started sowing chillies which does not get damaged

7460216 there is concern at the very highest level that kate middleton still does not have a job
7460217 the queen is keen that the monarchy should lead by example and that the princes and their girlfriends should all be seen to be hard workers
7460218 the queen has made it known that she feels kate should get involved with a charity possibly an animal charity where she can be seen to be doing something proactive and something entirely safe
7460219 it is important that kate isnt seen to be doing anything controversial and she needs to do something completely different from any of the charity work that diana did
7460220 the two were related by ancestry and united by destiny
7460221 i am georgiana i am not diana the film is not about diana
7460222 there is absolutely no reason to have done this trailer which is a bad joke
7460223 the marketing people probably thought the only way they could get young popcorn eating brigade to see this film was if they made some comparison with diana but they did not need to and should not have done it
7460224 i dont actually think that georgiana died in a carriage crash

7460247 we have approximately 300 burnt mounds on shetland but only four or five have been excavated and of those the cruester mound is the most fascinating and complex it looks as if it has been in use for anything between 500 to 1 000 years
7460248 one theory is that these structures may have been used for cooking meat or tanning hides
7460249 but it is possible they could have raised steam by heating the water and that these little cells could have been used as saunas

7460252 what i said to the team was to put it to the back of our minds because the most important thing for us is the one day series with south africa and that means standing up to be counted
7460253 there was unanimity to postpone the event until october next year unfortunately five of the participating nations found it impossible to send their teams to pakistan because of safety and security concerns

7460263 this is a new dawn for the people of this country and for all peruvians who wish to develop in freedom not in oppression
7460264 if that were to happen out of fear of protesters fear of unrest peru would some day remember it as the moment when change came to a halt and hundreds of thousands of people were condemned to poverty exclusion and marginalisation

7460270 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7460271 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7460272 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7460273 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7460274 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7460275 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7460276 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7460277 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7460278 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7460279 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7460280 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7460281 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7460282 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7460283 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7460284 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7460285 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7460286 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7460287 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7460288 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7460289 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7460290 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7460291 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7460292 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7460293 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7460294 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7460295 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7460296 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7460297 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7460298 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7460299 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7460300 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7460301 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7460302 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7460303 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7460304 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7460305 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

7460316 wenn man oben mitspielen will muss man mit der richtigen einstellung ins spiel gehen
7460317 es war nicht immer sch n anzusehen aber letzte saison haben wir solche spiele noch verloren oder nur unentschieden gespielt
7460318 angesichts der angespannten lage kommen wir nicht ohne eine verst rkung der friedenssoldaten aus
7460319 sie haben sich nicht vollst ndig aus den gegenden zur ckgezogen die als nicht umstritten gelten

7460325 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7460326 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7460327 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7460328 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7460329 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7460330 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7460331 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7460332 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7460333 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7460334 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7460335 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7460336 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7460337 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7460338 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7460339 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7460340 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7460341 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7460342 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7460343 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7460344 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7460345 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7460346 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7460347 wir stehen kurz davor eine weitere schl sseltechnologie zu kaufen mit der wir unseren anteil an der wertsch pfung bei der solarzellenproduktion deutlich erh hen werden

7460352 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7460353 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7460354 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7460355 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7460356 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7460357 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7460358 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7460359 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7460360 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7460361 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7460362 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7460363 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7460364 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7460365 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7460366 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7460367 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7460368 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7460369 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7460370 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7460371 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7460372 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7460373 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7460374 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7460375 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7460376 leul s a depreciat usor in deschiderea sedintei pana spre 3 53 lei euro dar a revenit la scurt timp spre 3 52 lei euro probabil ca dobanzile foarte mari din piata impiedica moneda nationala sa se deprecieze

7460379 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7460380 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7460381 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7460382 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7460383 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7460384 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7460385 its probably just a 3 shekel less than a dollar fuse ill fix it
7460386 this brings relief to those who are faced with distress and undue hardship we hope the measures will make a difference in the lives of poor people who are battling during these hard times where the cost of living has increased as a result of high food and petrol prices
7460387 the lack of adjustment of the means test to make it in line with inflation had diminished the value of the grants more especially in purchasing the basket of goods and services that is mostly consumed by the poor
7460388 i had a 107 average against keith on friday which is pretty heavy duty
7460389 even phil taylor might blink a little bit at that not that im looking to lock horns with phil taylor unless he wants to challenge me of course
7460390 that could be a good game and you make the right noises ill play dont worry
7460391 i feel very happy with the way i have played right the way through the league of legends
7460392 there were one or two dodgy moments but i managed to come through unscathed and i felt good going in to the finals
7460393 we were eight points up on them in the munster final and they beat us by five
7460394 after a game you are going to be disappointed when you throw away an eight point lead setanta readers comment of the day
7460395 new approach is fine today there was always the chance he would be a bit rusty and fresh after his layoff and thats what happened at newmarket
7460396 he wont be doing any fast work between now and leopardstown
7460397 i think in my head i convinced myself that im the best putter
7460398 i think through the past weeks and months and years with the media talking about my putting and writing about my putting and people talking about my putting and people want to help me i must have had hundreds of letters and phone calls and all saying that they can fix my putting
7460399 so i made a point after last week that going to change that attitude and i believed in myself that im the best putter and i came out here with a different attitude and i putted great this week
7460400 in order to achieve these objectives which are central to the success of the country as a non racial and non sexist democracy we need heroes and heroines whose sacrifices would communicate the message that what we seek to achieve is practically realisable provided that at all times and in all circumstances we will remain loyal to principle
7460401 we are meeting here today to celebrate raymond mhlaba because of what he did during six long decades to help the black oppressed of our country to sustain their sense of identity and continuity
7460402 raymond mhlaba was and is one of our outstanding national heroes his sacrifices constitute an integral part of the ethos which determines the sense and definition of the national identity
7460403 we must therefore project and actively market our national heroes and heroines such as raymond mhlaba
7460404 we must use the example set by our national heroes and heroines to establish a popularly accepted platform a uniting vision which the nation would use to propel the country towards the achievement of the humane goals spelt out in our national constitution and the constitutive act of the african union
7460405 out of that total number 14 were died on duty while 12 more died off duty this is because the province has the highest level of violent crime in the province such as cash in transit heists house robberies and car hijackings
7460406 as management we will continue to provide adequate training to our members and at the same time provide them with the necessary resources to maintain law and order
7460407 i am very happy to see the president and im hoping that he will help me to get a new house and maybe even a job
7460408 we need floodlights for the roads toilets general sanitation and decent housing
7460409 crime is not that much of a problem here but the community needs a police and fire station we recently received a clinic and our main road was tarred so things are coming along
7460410 the mozambique of today is much better than the mozambique of yesterday
7460411 and this is all proof that we are overcoming poverty that we are improving our lives that poverty is on the decline
7460412 its a fact that there are still many poor mozambicans
7460413 its a fact that we need more schools more hospitals and much more but its also a fact that todays mozambique is another mozambique much better than before the war ended
7460414 the best weapon in this fight for prosperity is knowledge which will ensure that each mozambican masters science and technology
7460415 and all of a sudden there were throngs of people walking down the street
7460416 we had the capacity to attract new voters people were skeptical of that but i think we proved it on caucus night here in iowa
7460417 that i think has become a hallmark for our campaign all across the country its part of the reason why we can campaign in so many states and why we are in very strong positions to compete in states that traditionally democrats have written off by now
7460418 said marygrace galston one of about five aides obama had in the state at the time of the first iowa trip
7460419 ultimately i am an imperfect vessel for your hopes and dreams
7460420 i was a little shy but i had to get up and start talking to people
7460421 youd have these old time pols say ive never seen three quarters of these people before
7460422 you dont like to tell people no but we had to be disciplined
7460423 i didnt care what a chattering head on cable had to say about why we hadnt moved ahead in national polls
7460424 it was that visual if you were at the top of the hill of these thousands of people
7460425 that was the first feeling that this could be real
7460426 we had obviously been kind of struggling up through then
7460427 we knew it was a good time to change the narrative and kind of boil down his final argument
7460428 i believe the american people are tired of fear and tired of distractions and tired of diversions
7460429 we can make this election not about fear but about the future and that wont just be a democratic victory that will be an american victory and that is a victory america needs right now
7460430 should he win the iowa caucuses saturdays dinner will be remembered as one of the turning points in his campaign in here
7460431 i saw that and decided its going to be ok
7460432 this was the moment when we tore down barriers that have divided us for too long when we rallied people of all parties and ages to a common cause when we finally gave americans who have never participated in politics a reason to stand up and do so
7460433 talk to me on nov 5 but if we win the presidency one of the major reasons will be that we will have replicated in enough states what we were able to do in iowa
7460434 at that stage turnbull handed over kennedys notes which detailed what packer was planning
7460435 this was done with some melodrama turnbull said to westerway i fear for myself my family for my career
7460436 as i watch whats happening in the liberal leadership he seems to be riding a very clever tour de france sort of race
7460437 hes sitting in behind sheltered from the wind ready to make his move whenever he chooses
7460438 now i can live with my children i can move and go anywhere
7460439 i havent got any plans to get married yet but i would like to
7460440 if it hadnt been someone i know i would have thought it was a joke
7460441 everything at this time points to it being mr miller
7460442 im baffled as to why the board would want to do this
7460443 it raises my antenna and makes me think something is going on
7460444 speaking very broadly you really cant come up with a strategy for negotiations if the other side is there listening
7460445 its representing the publics interest in a strategy session not a business deal that is the difference
7460446 it was very clearly defined to me that we were well within the code to do that
7460447 after speaking with several lawyers i felt it was appropriate
7460448 this is a district that has lost a great deal of trust because of the way it handled the local option sales tax
7460449 we dont re instill that by operating in the dark or in secrecy
7460450 i dont see a downside for them to let people know theyre having a meeting
7460451 its symbolic of the fact that at our caucus we had double the turnout from 04 and that thousands of new people were brought into the process
7460452 they told us their two friends were underwater and that they were drowning
7460453 a forceful response to the governors guilty verdict even before trial
7460454 i think its out of the ordinary but then again i think agriprocessors is a little out of the ordinary too
7460455 there will be no industrial jungles in iowa on my watch
7460456 if a governor feels an employer is not acting responsibly then he has every right to speak up
7460457 all he said was they were going to keep an eye on them and require compliance with the law
7460458 if youre a defense attorney you can make any argument you want
7460459 i think the governor is fairly reading the sense of people in the state on this
7460460 but at the end of the day they must obey each and every law that protects workers and keeps our food supply safe
7460461 we need to be able to say the students who arent interested in learning shouldnt be there
7460462 i know it can happen because it did for my kids
7460463 you just have to do what you have to do it takes a certain kind of woman to do but thats what i signed up for
7460464 were just going to take the plunge and try to make a life of our own and try to have our first year of marriage
7460465 he used to play army when he was a little boy
7460466 there are highs and lows sometimes its nerve wracking and sometimes you have peace that hes doing what he was trained to do
7460467 its obviously great because i havent seen anyone in seven months
7460468 they tell me to name the day i can show up and they will make it work thats hard to turn down
7460469 he can pretty much put his mind to something and do it well
7460470 as long as i have known him he has seemed to be the type of student who really had a lot of things figured out at a young age
7460471 i was either 16 or 17 my friends and i had taken it out for the fourth of july we watched the fireworks go off down by the statehouse and listened to the symphony and all that by the river then we pulled up the anchor and went to turn the engine on and the motor didnt work
7460472 the pontoon boat is going toward the dam were all freaking out drifting toward the dam about ready to go over everybody was just beside themselves
7460473 and all the sudden from the shore my dad had just driven up
7460474 my dad just always made me feel that i could try anything because i had this awesome backup it makes you probably a little overconfident when you have parents like that
7460475 i just met this girl that im going to spend the rest of my life with
7460476 im always motivated by things that could be really bad if you dont do the proper preparation
7460477 youre motivated to train to be able to climb everest well because you know for every five people that make it to the summit one person is going to die trying so its just this kind of obsession all you think about is failure thats what fuels it
7460478 its such a tall mountain that the elevation itself will kill you
7460479 itll do it one of two ways the first is called a pulmonary edema your lungs fill up with your own bodily fluids and you literally drown to death the second is where those same fluids will go up into your skull and crush your brain
7460480 they gave us this yellow brick road to the top of the world
7460481 its like being a good law student or a good lawyer or a good spouse or a good father or a good adventurer
7460482 you have to decide youre going to do something and then you have to do it every day its like fatherhood you have to be there every day
7460483 i only participate in sports where the odds are severely against me
7460484 doesnt approach the level of polish complexity or overall experience of the original
7460485 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget
7460486 if the departments can cut their budgets a minimum of 5 percent maybe we can use reserves to stem the tide a while until we get a handle of whats going on
7460487 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget
7460488 were also looking at water and garbage rates park rentals and other fees
7460489 la muerte es un t rmino muy relativo en esta serie
7460490 its too bad we have to pray from day one to the last day morris doesnt look like someone who can play the game quite well he could fall way too soon
7460491 sanford bernstein put out a fabulous report today may 15 about alternative energy that waxed wonderfully about wind and a little less wonderfully about solar the latter isnt as loved because the average selling price of solar is too high vs the dirty competition
7460492 i think that whats most interesting is theyre schneider electric buying xantrex for the wind exchangers
7460493 wind and solar stocks are transcending the weakness in oil
7460494 emission regulations growing global energy demands and newer projects such as coal gasification all should provide opportunities for woodward
7460495 to tell you the truth i had no idea how it is supposed to be spelled
7460496 it is troubling we have young people that are dying and being murdered
7460497 we cant deny weve got 19 homicides we dont have all the answers as to why
7460498 were growing as a community when these things happen we need to react and solve them
7460499 we dont know if theres an increase in crime unless weve looked at this over a period of time
7460500 i told him to leave i told him it was stupid dont go to the fight
7460501 were still asking those questions and its slowly being pieced together however we need to have all the information brought forward
7460502 its time for a change i may be old but i am an old person who believes in young ideas
7460503 i was probably the most visible hillary supporter there was
7460504 she didnt win i can accept that and i think most people are accepting that
7460505 bottom line we as a party cant afford another bush kind of term
7460506 i liked hillary i saw what she went through with the republicans and she didnt cave in
7460507 but i am not about to vote republican because she isnt the nominee
7460508 we took the bacon down to one day a week
7460509 its just something everyone loves you walk in schools and smell that bacon frying and the kids go crazy
7460510 tilleys departure was a shock a change in personnel can be good for the situation
7460511 this could be a small stumbling block for bhp because they wont be able to get a 100 per cent stake
7460512 they have arrested one of our mps here in the chamber we hear that they are also looking for a total of 15 of our members of parliament as part of an evil ploy to rig the elections for parliamentary speaker
7460513 at that stage turnbull handed over kennedys notes which detailed what packer was planning
7460514 this was done with some melodrama turnbull said to westerway i fear for myself my family for my career

7460517 unfortunate events took place the first time that a jury was empanelled to try the accused mr wood
7460518 i had to discharge the jury because some jurors disobeyed my instructions and misconducted themselves
7460519 at some considerable public expense and inconvenience to a lot of people i had to stop the trial
7460520 its possible that every member of this jury panel will have heard about read about or seen some report or comment about this case over the past few years
7460521 the court is anxious to ensure that every juror who tries this case can be completely impartial
7460522 you are absolutely forbidden to make your own inquiries about this trial

7460571 it may perhaps allow them to express their views on the proposed takeover a little bit more loudly given that they are a major shareholder
7460572 but as it stands their stake isnt big enough to influence the outcome and i dont think the government is going to allow them to raise their stake from here
7460573 we suspect the government is probably not that keen on it either
7460574 so in essence by allowing chinalco to lift their stake to round about 11 percent of the combined group its basically providing the opportunity that tom albanese of rio can defend any hostile bid

7460646 so i made a point after last week that going to change that attitude and i believed in myself that im the best putter and i came out here with a different attitude and i putted great this week

7460669 imponer a un hombre una grave pena como es la privaci n de la libertad una mancha en su honra como es la de haber estado en la c rcel y esto sin haberle probado que es culpable y con la probabilidad de que sea inocente es cosa que dista mucho de la justicia

7460671 consideraciones cr ticas sobre el actualmente denominado derecho penal del enemigo
7460672 todo malhechor al atacar al derecho social resulta por sus fechor as rebelde y traidor a la patria deja de ser miembro de ella al violar sus leyes y hasta le hace la guerra entonces la conservaci n del estado es incompatible con la suya es preciso que uno de los dos perezca y cuando se ejecuta al culpable es m s como enemigo que como ciudadano el procedimiento y la sentencia son la prueba y la declaraci n de que ha roto el contrato social y por consiguiente de que no es ya miembro del estado
7460673 no hay hombre malo del que no se pudiera hacer un hombre bueno para algo no hay derecho a hacer morir ni siquiera por ejemplariedad m s que a aqu l al que no se puede conservar sin peligro
7460674 un estado no puede tener por enemigo sino a otro estado y no a hombres pues no pueden fijarse verdaderas relaciones entre cosas de diversa naturaleza
7460675 sin declaraci n de guerra no hay enemigos sino bandoleros
7460676 no pueden ser consideradas penas los da os infligidos a quien es un enemigo declarado puesto que ese enemigo nunca estuvo sujeto a la ley no puede transgredirla o bien estuvo sujeto a ella y declara no estarlo m s negando en consecuencia la posibilidad de transgredirla por tanto todos los da os que puedan serle causados deben entenderse como actos de hostilidad en una situaci n de hostilidad declarada es leg timo infligir cualquier clase de da os cabe concluir pues que si por actos o palabras a sabiendas y deliberadamente un s bdito negase la autoridad del representante del estado sea cual fuere la penalidad prevista para la traici n el representante puede leg timamente hacerle sufrir lo que considere correcto al negar la sujeci n neg las penas previstas por la ley debe en consecuencia sufrir como enemigo del estado o sea conforme a la voluntad del representante las penas est n establecidas en la ley para los s bditos no para los enemigos como es el caso de quienes habi ndose tornado s bditos por sus propios actos se rebelen y nieguen el poder del soberano por propia voluntad
7460677 unfortunate events took place the first time that a jury was empanelled to try the accused mr wood
7460678 i had to discharge the jury because some jurors disobeyed my instructions and misconducted themselves
7460679 at some considerable public expense and inconvenience to a lot of people i had to stop the trial
7460680 its possible that every member of this jury panel will have heard about read about or seen some report or comment about this case over the past few years
7460681 the court is anxious to ensure that every juror who tries this case can be completely impartial
7460682 you are absolutely forbidden to make your own inquiries about this trial

7460689 well my main source of income is my web development business i do technical design and build web apps for businesses small and large for some reason family and friends always seemed to think this implied that i would be more than willing to build a nice website for them maybe in return for a cake or a hug other freelancers might nod in recognition at this point enticing as these offers where fact of the matter was that i never really had the time to build these websites for them much less keep them up to date this never ending deluge of requests together with the fact that a lot of my family and friends tend to dabble in the arts lead to the idea that i would be well served with a generalized tool that would allow me to quickly setup an online portfolio and that would allow the artist in question to maintain it themselves so what started as a website and cms for my mother quickly turned into a full fledged consumer product
7460690 i guess the fact that i opted to build this web application in the hours i wasnt spending on my freelance business was the biggest challenge startup veterans tend to tell you that the only way to get a project like this off the ground is to dedicate yourself fully to it and while they are probably right in most cases i found that my lack of both time and budget actually forced me to make some creative decisions when it came to managing these issues since i have a background in technical design i was able to write a reasonably solid technical design and outsource all the development work although this was the first time i opted for such a solution im quite happy with the results it allowed me to keep a certain distance from the development side of the project and regard the results more as client than builder in the end this allowed me to save costs and focus on the features not the technology having anxious family and friends available all waiting for their new portfolio helped as well of course i would only recommend outsourcing to startups who have technical expertise in house as well though
7460691 im based in the hague in the netherlands and as far as startups are concerned this isnt exactly a hotbed of entrepreneurship there are some startups here doing great stuff but there is definitely a lack of places where people in this scene can meet up and exchange ideas recently things are starting to look up though with more coworking spaces drinks and other events for entrepreneurs luckily i have a lot of business and friends in amsterdam so im regularly there to work on projects and tend to hang out at most of the places where you would find dutch startups spend a week in amsterdam coworking at the right places and you will probably meet 80 of the internet startups in the netherlands this relative small size of the scene as opposed to silicon valley can be a great advantage plus the atmosphere here is rather relaxed it also seems the the funding opportunities have been picking up lately with some dutch startups hooking up with great investors both local and abroad i have managed to stay self funded for now though so im hardly and expert in that particular part of startup culture
7460692 my startup is somewhat different from most since it totally ignores the social web when you sign up for a portfolio at fresh li there is no way to add your friends show off your great taste or even upload an avatar i have a very narrow focus of allowing people to manage their portfolio in a simple way and frankly the whole social thing just gets in the way for this particular use case the artists who host their website with fresh li dont want their visitors to see related work they want them to see their work without distractions this has great advantages in the sort of functionality i can get away with less is definitely better since it keeps things simple and most of my current clients do not have much experience on the next web expect perhaps updating their myspace pages therefore i dont think fresh li will have much of an impact on the next web but it does serve as a reminder that there is this huge untapped potential of people out there that still feel quite uncomfortable with most of what the next web has to offer hopefully i can convince some of these people that publishing on the web is not necessarily hard and can be achieved without learning lots of acronyms and share high quality posts even if youre not a tech nerd rss will play a vital role in the next web so we think its really important to help mainstream users get comfortable with it
7460693 my biggest challenge beyond the development one will be reaching the kind of people that would want to use fresh li since most of them are not really on the web in the sort of way that most of the readers of this blog will be i wont be able to reach them through the usual channels startups use like the next web techcrunch and others like them for my marketing efforts i will try and get as close to the source of artists as possible i e the art academy flyers should help but im also trying to get my website into the collection of tools students use to get their work online currently dominated by blogging tools not really fit for this purpose since my marketing budget is rather close to zero i wont be able to actually buy advertising space in some of the media that might be interesting to my target audience but i dont have much trust in the effectiveness of that kind of old media channel anyway what ive found so far is that word of mouth is by far the most effective some of my current customers have been the best pr people i could wish for most new customers find me because a friend pointed the site out to them still marketing in the non web world with a small budget is hard work and an area i would love to read more about

7460698 these legal cases will hopefully no longer be a distraction and that everyone will focus on the team and our abilities on the floor
7460699 i will admit it was stressful at first but we worked together and learned to direct our attention to the task at hand and at the time that was playing a winning season
7460700 the athletes are really happy here and are having fun
7460701 we are continuing to grow and work towards a phenomenal season performance
7460702 the university will continue to move forward in providing the best possible experiences for students faculty and staff

7460705 we want to make sure people know exactly who sen obama is and where he wants to take the country and two that voters know their choice in this election between barack obama who wants to fundamentally change the way business is done in washington and john mccain who is just more of the same of what we have had over the course of the last eight years
7460706 hes got to be focused simple and clear rather than elegiac this is not a great novel this is a short clear focused discussion unless it is clear and real simple he has failed
7460707 obama certainly hasnt opened up any huge lead over john mccain in a year that should be an easy year for a democratic candidate
7460708 i think the country still wants to know who barack obama is and where he wants to take the country in a more specific direction than he has given
7460709 you cant lose the change mantra but youve got to continue to indict mccain
7460710 the bottom line is do you want four more years when they leave the convention they need to have fairly vetted that and answered that question
7460711 if you are going to buy an iphone you buy an iphone
7460712 but there are also people who will never buy an iphone they have something thats already interesting and they want to do something their browser cant
7460713 i didnt even expect them to make it to the finals
7460714 the night they won we had 350 people in the parking lot
7460715 ive never seen so many standing ovations in my life
7460716 its going to be a challenge to top this years
7460717 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7460718 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7460719 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7460720 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7460721 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7460722 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig
7460723 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7460724 i think its the number one thing that brings frustration anxiety and knots in your stomach all the things that go along with the injury to the players which do not allow your team to function as it is presented on paper
7460725 those types of things are very difficult for coaches no matter what age you are
7460726 i am more than willing to hold a dialogue with them
7460727 the province had 997 000 registered voters in the 2007 elections so we need that number of signatures to muster the 10 percent required by the law
7460728 the issues raised are not valid on meritorious grounds to say that the people of pampanga lost their trust and confidence in me the civil society groups in pampanga are one with me in pushing for responsible governance
7460729 i may have a difference of position with some civil society groups in my insistence to retain atty vivian dabug as the provincial administrator but this is prompted by valid and justifiable reasons she is incorruptible hardworking and confident
7460730 yes hindi ako marunong maglaro ng pulitika i do not know how to play politics especially with power play misuse of funds but i love where i am now there is gods hand in the work that i am doing
7460731 the issue here is jueteng and not governance if its governance you can easily hold a dialogue
7460732 for me this research has been a very personal journey
7460733 i had this personal insight i saw this as a way to turn this personal tragedy into a way of addressing this social problem
7460734 read about other women who went on to live a healthy and happy life and if they desired to get married and have a child
7460735 i didnt have any illusions this would be a happy story i wanted it to be an accurate story
7460736 its kind of a no holds barred social activism shes one of those people who lives it rather than just talk about it
7460737 id like to explore what women are led to believe and what its actually like

7460740 the gc games convention will be back in leipzig again in 2009
7460741 the industry and visitors are giving us their clear support to continue with the fair in leipzig
7460742 do you think there should be a gc in leipzig in 2009
7460743 anyone who has experienced the enthusiastic mood in the exhibition halls over the last seven years knows this fair belongs in leipzig
7460744 the fairs and conferences in leipzig are becoming increasingly international and attract more and more visitors were pleased with this development i completely agree with the governor of the free state of saxony stanislaw tillich that we will do everything to help this new cultural sector and the gc games convention to achieve further success
7460745 the concept is flexible and the network of the global games industry permits us to be active at different locations after the southeast asian games convention we are now focusing on the north american market

7460791 we hebben nu reden om te geloven dat een logische fout in de gems code dit incident kan veroorzaken als er geen antivirus programma op de server is ge nstalleerd
7460792 we zijn inderdaad gealarmeerd dat onze eerdere analyse van deze kwestie onjuist was
7460793 its going to be very exciting i think your mother instincts really kick in the day you find out that youre pregnant and for me its been a blast preparing for it getting the nursery ready and all that so were both really looking forward to it
7460794 i really like to do it knitting but i always kind of have a hole in it i dont have anything made yet for my baby but maybe i will
7460795 pete and i keep our music separate we collaborate on other things like making a baby
7460796 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7460797 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7460798 crystal meth is rapid heart rate obsessive grooming the feeling that bugs are crawling on your skin and rapid tooth decay
7460799 most people would say its on the graphic side but we say its just the true depiction of the reality of drug use
7460800 people dont really know the risks of it at least one out of every 10 kids that we quiz put meth in the same category as marijuana
7460801 i think there are so many things out there that are trying to take away our youth
7460802 music is a big influence in society for young people so using it to combat some of the things we are dealing with is an effective tool to win back our youth
7460803 whether they stick to their promise is up to them but at the very least we know they have been made aware of the risks and can make the decision themselves which ties into the adapt campaign
7460804 adapt to us means were going to give you some information and you need to adapt it to the situation that comes across for you
7460805 what youre almost doing by picking on one drug is saying the rest are ok thats how they read it
7460806 they say well that ones bad so the other ones must be ok
7460807 for street kids the use of meth has dropped considerably in the last few years
7460808 we are a preventative initiative and the whole basis of that would be to curb it before it might even arrive
7460809 if we had to fight crystal meth and it was already here it would be a losing battle
7460810 the demand that were seeing has far exceeded even our wildest expectations
7460811 people want to catch up on events that they miss
7460812 is that they want to resee and revisit the major events they had seen on tv earlier
7460813 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7460814 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7460815 as the high pressure area that has been steering fay departs the northeast another high will descend from canada into the great lakes not only will this keep fays motion to a crawl but it could even nearly stall the tropical system over the lower mississippi valley early in the week
7460816 will be a tropical depression by tuesday and will eventually grow into a tropical storm or hurricane that will threaten cuba the u s and or the bahama islands late this week
7460817 it is way too early to even speculate which part of the u
7460818 the second school of thought is that 94 l will curve northwestward towards a trough of low pressure just off of the us east coast which could put 94 l in the vicinity of the bahamas by late this week or early next weekend and a threat to the u s east coast between next sunday and next tuesday
7460819 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7460820 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7460821 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7460822 theres so much that we dont know about this poll like were clinton backers even distinguished in july since they only tell us about their june opinions
7460823 they can see its not a huge problem some have even gone out on activities on tours or sand biking
7460824 he was extremely motivated and extremely thrifty he put every penny away that he could i think that comes from having lived through a depression and a war i think it changed a lot of men of that age
7460825 he was a very hard worker and he never let anything hold him back or keep him down
7460826 he did what he could with what he had life was hard for him he didnt have a lot of tools to get by but he made it work he wasnt taught how to express affection he didnt know how to show it
7460827 id get out of my last class at safford school and run all the way to the hotel to be there at 4
7460828 he gave his parents the down payment for their house
7460829 he was very proud he gave them the down payment
7460830 he was going into areas that hadnt been done before taking auto parts by truck to the service stations he was the guy who serviced the service stations
7460831 he put every penny away that he could i think that comes from having lived through a depression and a war i think it changed a lot of men of that age they realized how important it was to have something set aside in case something were to happen
7460832 mike and his wife were wonderful parents and he was one of the kindest fathers i have ever known
7460833 he was there for his children when they needed him and was an honorable and honest businessman his entire life
7460834 hes been very active in the knights of columbus particularly in raising money for the seminarians for young fellows to be priests
7460835 he was the oldest living member of the knights of columbus in the state of arizona
7460836 to get to 100 is really hard not many people have the stamina and the stubbornness to get there
7460837 the patients do feel a tingle in their scalp which is not at all unpleasant that is really our only side effect and it is not at all a problem it merely indicates to the patient that there has been a treatment medications are somewhat effective but they all have side effects our treatment has zero side effects

7460841 every summer a few of my associates and i have what we call an innovation retreat
7460842 we get together and say what does the world need to be invented and we try to invent it
7460843 migraine is a mechanism that is built into the human brain we all possess it and it becomes active by an efficient build up of its triggers
7460844 but once those triggers rise above the threshold migraine becomes activated and symptoms occur
7460845 the degree of symptoms depends on how high above the threshold your triggers are
7460846 i used to have migraines and some medicines made me sicker than the headache
7460847 this is a nondrug treatment for bad headaches thats why its important
7460848 the bottom line from my perspective is that its best to prevent it rather than to walk around with some expensive hardware to zap yourself every time you get an aura
7460849 a group of protesters tried to defy curfew and indulged in violence at hajan four security force personnel received injuries as someone from the mob fired at them
7460850 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7460851 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7460852 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip

7460861 you dont have to be a millionaire to make cash when dealing with gaming in indonesia securities
7460862 most successful traders start with as little as one thousand dollars and slowly build from there
7460863 frankly one can get rid of the element of chance by doing good research
7460864 i personally spend at least 2 hours a day researching gaming in indonesia trends and buying activity while watching the latest sell reports from bakey glavin investment firm inc
7460865 it took me forever to get my portfolio to the point where it was making a steady flow of cash but once it was i knew that sustaining this cash flow would be an entirely new challenge luckily for me i successfully reinvested gaming in indonesia marketing dividends and was able to capitalize on a strong bull market
7460866 the best things in life are free but making money with gaming in indonesia is not at least according to barnhardt myles

7460953 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7460954 its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7460955 some people have said its as big a financial shock as the great depression and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal in the 1970s
7460956 there are periods when markets look like they are getting better then another grenade explodes another bout of fear of sustainability of some financial institutions maybe intervention by the authorities
7460957 it has been very much ebb and flow and the mood here is very much one of financial caution as regards the next year we have our fingers crossed but there is the recognition there is still quite a long way to go yet
7460958 on the assumption commodity prices remain stable and if anything fall back then inflation should drop back as we go through next year
7460959 one would hope that the conditions in credit markets should gradually start to improve and those two factors will help to ensure growth will start to pick up as we go through next year
7460960 its going to be a tricky period household real income is very low that will make it difficult for households and there are difficult social issues that will arise
7460961 but the important thing is people realise this is just a transitory period of subdued of growth and we will get through the other side and growth will resume to more normal levels
7460962 hopefully we can go back to something like the steady growth that we experienced over the past decade

7460967 is consistent with mounting indications that russia had been planning an attack on georgia in advance and was just waiting for a pretext to carry it out
7460968 russias state controlled media seemed extremely well prepared to cover the outbreak of armed conflict in georgia tv immediately presented elaborate graphics with news anchors and commentators appearing to stick to disciplined talking points accusing georgian president mikheil saakashvili of aggression and the georgian armed forces of genocide and ethnic cleansing
7460969 the speed of the russian response suggests that the russians were ready they were just waiting

7461016 stephen has invested his heart in the mediacom and groupm networks over the years when the opportunity came up for him to continue shaping and growing the business in a significant potent manner he jumped at the chance we are thrilled to have won steve as ceo for mediacom globally
7461017 when mediacom acquired tmb in the uk back in 1999 the tmb management was one of the best reasons for the acquisition i considered this one of the best management teams in the world and knew that this management would strongly lead our uk organisation in the future my dream even back then was that stephen allan would one day take over the leadership of mediacom worldwide i am wholeheartedly glad that he is now ready to do so
7461018 all of us at mediacom owe a huge debt of thanks to alexander his vision and leadership transformed us into a truly global media agency like alexander mediacom is in my blood and i am relishing the opportunity to further unlock the potential of our business there are so many talented people inside our network and i really do believe that for mediacom the best is yet to come
7461019 everything you say is looked at and in many cases misconstrued
7461020 theres a reason why people like her its because she doesnt sort of you know fuel the fire
7461021 i wake up every morning wondering how on the earth im going to pull off that next minor miracle to get through the day
7461022 with the exception of the campaign trail and life in the public eye i have to say that my life now is really not that much different from many of yours
7461023 obamas stadium address on thursday the 45th anniversary of s i have a dream speech will result in effusive and overwhelming press coverage this coverage will be impenetrable and will undoubtedly impact the polls
7461024 the one returns this time to lead us to the road to denver
7461025 we will encourage voters to look beyond the glamour of s celebrity status to his inexperience and lack of accomplishment
7461026 even democrats in ohio are calling on ohioans are beginning to wonder if theres anything more to barack obama than his trusty teleprompter
7461027 hiding out in one of your seven houses while your surrogates launch more low road attacks is not a surprising strategy for
7461028 but given his shocking disconnect with the struggles of american families john mccain would be better served using this time to rewrite his economic plan that was authored by an adviser who thinks we are a nation of whiners and which offers nothing more than the same failed bush economic policies of the last eight years
7461029 no no no that was a misstated report he tries to hit the gym for about an hour a day
7461030 dont know the gyms his time he doesnt get bothered much in there
7461031 people have asked me this and im sincere when i say its not on my radar screen
7461032 the day after my election to the somebody asked me am i running in 2008 i said at that time no and nothing so far has changed my mind
7461033 i dont want to be coy about this given the responses that ive been getting over the last several months i have thought about the possibility
7461034 i stand before you today to announce my candidacy for
7461035 obama has picked someone who is going to be very aggressive in going after mccain and who is not going to be recalcitrant about it
7461036 if i was mccain id be thinking about my own attack dog
7461037 hes going to want someone who can go toe to toe with biden
7461038 certainly biden was a big choice for obama and it does therefore force mccain to think about a big choice both in terms of debates and the potential demographic or state by state advantages in who he picks for his running mate
7461039 there are babies whove been born and are now walking and talking since we started this campaign
7461040 it has been a long pull all of us wish it would be shorter
7461041 of course the other way of looking at things is that liverpool have now got away with poor performances twice and are threatening to exhaust a seasons supply of fortune before august is out
7461042 i know people expect us to get through but its not as if we are playing a mickey mouse team the belgium league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages they caught us a bit cold in the first leg they were spot on tactically hitting us on the counter attack we didnt play well and we know we will have to improve at anfield
7461043 there is a lot of pressure when you play for liverpool and i know what the headlines would have been if we had lost to middlesbrough
7461044 i have been here long enough to know what it is like so to reverse it and go top of the league shows what fine lines there are in football im sure there would have been a lot of criticism of players and the manager had we lost but we are top of the league and thats the difference
7461045 if we perform as we have done over the last few weeks its going to be extremely difficult to beat standard li ge theyre not a mickey mouse team
7461046 weve shown what we intend to do this season over the two weeks home and away thats how we will play
7461047 others will have to play to their strengths and with the pace in our side we felt we could come here and play as we did
7461048 i couldnt ask for more from the lads if wed have come off with a point we would have been disappointed and im heartbroken for them we have great belief in them and however disappointed they are now they should take a lot out of it
7461049 the ratepayers in the area are going to see the cost of local services rise and it is highly likely that fly tipping will be carried out by less scrupulous businesses
7461050 most of my waste would be green waste and the odd time you might have some brick or something like that but 95 would be green waste
7461051 price rises over the years have tended to be a bit more than inflation but all of a sudden this year they trebled when they had already risen by 10 or more this year 50 is very very high and thats a cost you have to pass on to the customer at the end of the day
7461052 labour fuel and waste disposal are the major costs in this sort of mobile business
7461053 if you have a shop or commercial premises and you have bins you can make use of them but when you are going out to peoples houses and doing work you have to dispose of the material somewhere
7461054 my only other option would be to get a skip and i may not be able to make use of a skip if its only a little bit of grass cuttings or prunings
7461055 we were getting a lot of people coming outside the borough to use our facilities some even from as far away as newtownabbey
7461056 a lot of this is going to landfill we already pay 2m a year in landfill costs and that is charged to the local ratepayer
7461057 the council considered it unfair that ratepayers were shouldering this considerable financial burden and decided to increase commercial charges at our sites from a minimum of 15 to a minimum of 25 with additional costs depending on the amount of waste being left
7461058 costs have also been increased at weekends to discourage businesses from using the civic amenity sites at this time when they are already busy with domestic users and in particular residents keen to recycle
7461059 council is committed to providing facilities for commercial customers to dispose of their waste and this service is available seven days a week
7461060 you saw the team we put out for them to win anywhere in the premier league is a credit
7461061 i should be helping them by bringing in reinforcements to help them
7461062 is that affecting them of course it is they arent daft
7461063 it has been absolutely brilliant with brilliant international stars everyone had a very good time despite the weather
7461064 we have a terrific wealth of talent here in northern ireland i see it in sport and in the arts and it has been my great pleasure to be involved with both
7461065 i slutet av veckan vet vi var vi st r
7461066 he nearly got killed he was very very lucky and hes still got the scars to show that
7461067 there were always issues about whether or not he would play for his country again but hes got over that hes such a lovely lad a real gem hes fine now
7461068 mama is powerful tall and strong and we do play a direct style here so if you play a diagonal ball into him he can flick it on in the box which is a strength of ours
7461069 wed have been delighted whoever got the goal as long as we won but when he got it there was a little smile on everyones faces because hes a gentleman off the pitch
7461070 theyre very dangerous but we thought we had resolved the problems of coping with them
7461071 we had one last long throw to deal with and whether it was a bit of luck or what the ball ended up in our net one thing in the last minute of a game is if you cant win it then at least dont lose it
7461072 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage if we want to retain our position as a constructive eu member state we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
7461073 minister roche is not calling for a second referendum to be put that would not be a fair reflection the government is instead following the steps it said it would take in the wake of the referendum outcome
7461074 we now need to take a hard look at our situation within the eu
7461075 we have to recognise however that all other member states 26 sovereign democratic parliaments are likely to have ratified the treaty by the end of the year this will leave ireland in an isolated position
7461076 in the view of the other member states we will be preventing the eu from equipping itself to deal with the many political and economic challenges facing todays europe
7461077 not an inch is not a policy that has much to commend it in a dynamic europe that wants to move forward
7461078 we need to deal with the referendum result step by step we should not jump to hasty conclusions or exclude any options
7461079 we have to explore all possible solutions we cannot exclude the possibility that at some stage and in the right circumstances it may be necessary to consult the people once again
7461080 in the grand scheme of things this is a new low this pub is a very respectable place that is used by many local groups the elderly and for social occasions for someone to come in and spray a load of bullets is a new low by risking hurting innocent people
7461081 we have received great co operation so far and we are appealing for anyone with information to contact us
7461082 unfortunately shootings in dublin have become an all too regular occurrence
7461083 the fact that many shootings are taking place in public places such as last nights shootings in a pub in finglas shows that the criminals responsible have absolutely no fear of being caught
7461084 this is partially because of a lack of gardai in the communities where they operate
7461085 sinn fein has been calling for higher garda visibility in communities that are suffering from high levels of crime we want to see extra garda patrols particularly on foot and on bicycle in these communities
7461086 and i know that i will have to come here to play bolton manchester united manchester city here in the north i understand that now
7461087 you always say that first placed team playing against the last is not easy
7461088 chelsea didnt look at any stage like they would rip us apart like they did with portsmouth
7461089 chelsea have had a bad day but a piece of brilliance from deco has saved them thats why they are at the highest level if it hadnt been him they have others who can do that
7461090 it doesnt mean that much to be top after just two games
7461091 but its good for the group to have six points
7461092 but when i am in the club i will discuss this its impossible before an important game with so many problems
7461093 i want to play by pressurising the opponent but to do that you need to win games in order to gain confidence
7461094 i know how physical this division can be but there is always a time in every match that you have some space they told me these boys were good players it is up to me to get the best out of them
7461095 it takes time to gel but good players settle in quickly and they let themselves and the fans down
7461096 weve got a carling cup game on tuesday and some players could be asked to give up their shirts
7461097 since installing our wood pellet boiler in august 2006 we have noticed significant savings in our heating costs
7461098 you can imagine the amount of energy we are using in heating and supplying hot water to our 81 bedrooms as well as our leisure complex which comprises a swimming pool steam room and sauna
7461099 we wanted to do our bit for the environment and reduce our carbon emissions
7461100 we also appreciate that our guests are now taking additional steps to make their homes more eco friendly and this way they can continue to reduce their carbon footprint whilst on holiday
7461101 hopefully its not as bad this time but theyre not going to give any medals out in august or september everybody wishes are that you win every game and it doesnt happen and everybody wishes that you dont get injuries but it happens
7461102 we dont want a massive gap to open up between ourselves and the other teams who are going to be up there
7461103 the newcastle result was disappointing but that has gone were looking at portsmouth and then the super cup then weve got a two week break before facing liverpool away we want to make sure we go into that break with two wins under our belt
7461104 it might work to my advantage that so many players are out
7461105 we have a lot of players out just now and when we are short of numbers you need to take your opportunities there is so much quality in the squad we all know if you do not perform the manager will have you straight out of the team
7461106 but as we have seen plenty of times before the manager will stick by you if you do the job he needs
7461107 we were concerned because the clowney river and the ballymurphy stream flow down from the west into the blackstaff river which is underneath what is now the broadway underpass these rivers regularly flooded our areas over the years before they were culverted for what is now the underpass
7461108 we the steering group warned the drd that the underpass could flood and that a flyover would be a more suitable alternative but we were given all kinds of assurances by the drd that engineers were working on the issue and that it flooding would never happen
7461109 had the underpass not flooded st james and the village would have been flooded instead the water coming down the clowney river caused the flooding as it flowed over its banks onto the road and into the underpass
7461110 if this underpass worked as well as we were promised then it should have been able to take the water from the clowney river the ballymurphy stream and the blackstaff river
7461111 they drd were quite dismissive of the issue and assured us that it would not be a problem
7461112 i was talking to an engineer working at the underpass last week and he said only a temporary drainage pump had been installed during the underpass work and it had not been able to cope with the water
7461113 review the design operation and management aspects of the clowney water system with the dbfo company who are responsible for the design and construction of the m1 westlink scheme
7461114 this review will examine the short and longer term arrangements associated with the rivers which resulted in the flooding in this area
7461115 roads service had initially proposed a flyover to link the m1 with the westlink at broadway this matter was considered in detail at a public inquiry into the environmental statement in 2000 and following the recommendations of the independent inspector to the public inquiry the design was changed to an underpass
7461116 the permanent pumping system will also be designed to deal with the run off of normal rain water
7461117 the inundation of the clowney water into the underpass clearly overwhelmed the normal drainage system ten million gallons of water filled the underpass in a period of 45 minutes no pumping system would be capable of dealing with this volume of water in this period of time
7461118 the work will be carried out in stages as there is a risk of small scale loss of fish water quality will be closely monitored by the environment agency
7461119 we are happy to be able to resolve a situation which has been deeply upsetting for local fishermen and for the friends of waterworks park
7461120 it is not known how this invasive plant got into the pond but it could take several years of spraying before it is fully cleared up
7461121 we need to ensure we take the most efficient action to tackle this plant while ensuring the least damage possible to the environment
7461122 we have had discussions with the friends of the waterworks about the situation and they are eager to see remedial action undertaken i am sure they will understand the balance that had to be achieved and welcome the councils action
7461123 i knew how good aiden was when i left but he has improved a hell of a lot he has pretty much everything now the final delivery the shot or pass he has that end product to his game now and he scares the life out of defenders when he starts running at them
7461124 i will take the positives out of it one or two of our young players got a taste of it and sometimes to blood one or two you have to take a hit
7461125 after 38 games we will see who the winner is every old firm game is hard and you want to win every game
7461126 it doesnt matter where you are in the table you still want to win we are still hurting about this game we arent thinking about celtic so much
7461127 i just want to come here today to see if im any good i want to be up on a stage with the lights shining down on me i wake up in the morning and just want to sing it is my life
7461128 i think youre terrific youve just got it a good voice you look good chicks are going to love you and the mums are going to love you
7461129 i think youre so cute you have a really great range your performance was fantastic i really enjoyed it
7461130 it means the world to me words cant describe how much it means to me it is unbelievable
7461131 i am scheduled to stay in the hospital for a few days after my operation which should be around four or five hours
7461132 i am due to go home two or three weeks after my operation i look forward to be going back to school to meet my friends
7461133 we had a mini tornado in the suburbs of new york on friday we never witnessed it in our lives it was a bit scary tree branches were broken off some places even got bad flooding
7461134 we raised around 1m all of it in ireland and most of it in the north west
7461135 i would pay tribute to everyone who contributed they say irish people are the most generous in the world and this proves it
7461136 when i saw the scars after the operation last october i was speechless
7461137 he looked like hed been bitten by a shark hes got an inner strength that id never seen before he meets the surgery and the pain head on hes an inspiration and will inspire people all over the world after this
7461138 the next surgery will be four to five hours which will mean around 60 hours of surgery in a year but hes ready for it he firmly believes that this is his moment and its a moment hes waited for all his life
7461139 tissues were taken from his leg this time last year to fill out his lower mouth and make it bigger then they implanted a steel plate in the lower end of his mouth that was for the jaw and to accommodate dental implants they have made for him
7461140 i could understand if someone was a councillor and an mla who was attempting to become a minister if it was offered
7461141 lets see if you can do it in one take
7461142 last year the dulse and yellow man trifle was a shock for many people but when they tasted it they were quite surprised many people said they liked it but we wanted to try something new this year
7461143 so dulse was there fried in batter as a garnish for the dinner main course
7461144 we almost had to buy him a very bright pair with butterflies on them
7461145 but eventually we managed to get something more suitable for the minister
7461146 it is very difficult to see how this target can be achieved as we would have to get the full bill through all its consultation and committee stages of the assembly to be in a position to go live in april next year it is such an important topic that to try and steamroller it through with accelerated passage i think would meet resistance in the assembly
7461147 there are different issues that need to be resolved within the executive and educational reform is one of those we need the savings that esa will bring about to get this money into the classroom
7461148 i will be bringing the rpa to the executive it is a top priority for me and we are moving forward to the deadline that we have established
7461149 it is anticipated that by year three following the establishment of esa annual savings of 20m can be achieved in the administration of education this money will be made available to go directly to schools delays will mean the savings have not been made therefore schools budgets will be less than they could have been
7461150 detectives are treating the incident as an abduction and are liaising closely with an garda siochana as there is a possibility that bailey may be in the south of ireland
7461151 we need to reassure people that the people responsible for this will be held to account
7461152 there have been complaints in the past and we have dealt with this with the psni that a number of people who were arrested go to court and get bail too easily there has been in the past condemnation of the length of sentences
7461153 it would appear that this very serious incident has resulted from actions that are becoming a regular occurrence in the area and it seems that this has been the case for quite some time
7461154 there is now a responsibility on the police to put extra resources into tackling joyriding here and in the other hotspot areas around the city we have been saying for some time that it will only be a matter of time before a tragedy happens
7461155 a number of years ago the sdlp ran a campaign calling on greater action against joyriders we are looking for the courts to come down hard on offenders we have also called for the passengers in any joy riding incident to be held accountable and for the introduction of a victim impact assessment to be given consideration in court
7461156 you wna go out with some guy you dont know
7461157 well you cant be any worse than the guys i do know
7461158 could not be explained by other factors such as birth weight the age of the mother order of birth gestational diabetes and whether the baby was breast fed or not
7461159 not all women have the choice of whether to have a caesarean section or not but those who do may wish to take this risk into consideration before choosing to give birth this way
7461160 we already know that genetics and childhood infections play a vital role in the development of type 1 diabetes in children but the findings of this study indicate that the way a baby is delivered could affect how likely it is to develop this condition later in life diabetes uk would welcome more research in this area
7461161 this study shows a consistent 20 increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
7461162 type 1 diabetes in childhood has become much more prevalent across europe recently and the rate of this increase suggests that environmental factors are the cause however despite much investigation these actual factors remain largely unknown
7461163 the inclusion of hunger and fifty dead men walking in one of the worlds most prestigious film festivals is fantastic news and we send our congratulations to everyone involved
7461164 the film and television sector has strong support in northern ireland not least through the substantial investment from invest ni
7461165 it is also excellent to see the wealth of stunning locations we can offer
7461166 you can never take anything for granted in life never
7461167 i would like to think were one of cheapest clubs in the premier league and i think thats right for the area we live in i dont think well be the only club who get affected the credit crunch is there theres no doubt about it sometimes people think that football can just sail on regardless of whats happening in the world but its vulnerable to these things
7461168 she was the only candidate so it was pretty much a foregone conclusion
7461169 obamas stadium address on thursday the 45th anniversary of rev martin luther king jr s i have a dream speech will result in effusive and overwhelming press coverage this coverage will be impenetrable and will undoubtedly impact the polls
7461170 the one returns this time to lead us to the road to denver
7461171 we will encourage voters to look beyond the glamour of barack obamas celebrity status to his inexperience and lack of accomplishment
7461172 even democrats in ohio are calling on senator obama to offer something more than a lofty speech ohioans are beginning to wonder if theres anything more to barack obama than his trusty teleprompter
7461173 hiding out in one of your seven houses while your surrogates launch more low road attacks is not a surprising strategy for john mccain
7461174 but given his shocking disconnect with the struggles of american families john mccain would be better served using this time to rewrite his economic plan that was authored by an adviser who thinks we are a nation of whiners and which offers nothing more than the same failed bush economic policies of the last eight years
7461175 i didnt have time to write a short letter so i wrote a long one instead
7461176 ha five minutes i can do five minutes in my sleep

7461183 i wake up every morning wondering how on the earth im going to pull off that next minor miracle to get through the day
7461184 with the exception of the campaign trail and life in the public eye i have to say that my life now is really not that much different from many of yours
7461185 wir begr en das attraktive angebot denn mit shire limited haben wir nach intensiver pr fung einen langfristigen partner gefunden der gemeinsam mit jerini das vorrangige strategische ziel verfolgt die markteinf hrung von firazyr in europa und die zulassung in den usa voranzutreiben und damit firazyr m glichst vielen patienten auf der ganzen welt zug nglich zu machen
7461186 i think people now will take their problems their issues their concerns to doi where in the past sometimes that would happen but not nearly to the degree that it does now
7461187 that hit me at all sides because it hit me so early it molded how i began to operate
7461188 the mayor is tremendously supportive of me and the doi
7461189 hes not interested in sweeping things under the rug ever
7461190 theres about a gallon of my blood on the floor of city hall
7461191 we welcome shires attractive offer after thorough inspection we know shire is a long term partner who shares jerinis primary strategic goal to push ahead with the market launch of firazyr in europe and also to gain marketing approval in the united states thereby making firazyr accessible to the greatest possible number of patients worldwide
7461192 die nachlassende wirtschaftliche dynamik in europa hat bereits auf das hotel und gastst ttengewerbe bergegriffen das europ ische gastgewerbe gibt teilweise deutlich vorsichtigere prognosen zur gesch ftsentwicklung ab als im letzten jahr besonders in gro britannien und spanien wo die auswirkungen der finanzmarktkrise besonders ausgepr gt sind

7461194 this partnership is yet another example of the success we are experiencing on the north american market
7461195 the growth weve seen on this market during the last year in a market where focus lies on cost cutting and down sizing is tremendous and gives us strong faith for the future in north america as well as in other markets facing the same economic trends

7461207 the need for respect for the archaeological historical cultural and religious heritage of iraq and for the continued protection of archaeological historical cultural and religious sites museums libraries and monuments
7461208 we reaffirm our commitment to protect iraqs natural resources as the patrimony of the people of iraq which should be used only for their benefit
7461209 it was there in what the greeks called mesopotamia that life as we know it today began there people first began to speculate on philosophy and religion developed concepts of international trade made ideas of beauty into tangible forms and above all developed the skill of writing

7461231 i feel very happy with the way i have played right the way through the league of legends
7461232 there were one or two dodgy moments but i managed to come through unscathed and i felt good going in to the finals
7461233 i think in my head i convinced myself that im the best putter
7461234 i think through the past weeks and months and years with the media talking about my putting and writing about my putting and people talking about my putting and people want to help me i must have had hundreds of letters and phone calls and all saying that they can fix my putting
7461235 so i made a point after last week that going to change that attitude and i believed in myself that im the best putter and i came out here with a different attitude and i putted great this week
7461236 we were eight points up on them in the munster final and they beat us by five

7461253 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7461254 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
7461255 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7461256 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas

7461260 the last 10 years have seen a three fold increase in the prescription of the drug ritalin a drug used for attention deficit disorder one asks why
7461261 why suddenly is there greater demand for a drug for attentional problems
7461262 this might and i stress might be something to do with the increased exposure of young children to unsupervised and lengthy hours in front of a screen
7461263 could it be and this is just a suggestion which i think we should look into could it be if a small child is sitting in front of a screen pressing buttons and getting reactions quickly for many hours they get used to and their brains get used to rapid responses
7461264 could it be that they then have to sit still for half an hour and of course theyre not used to that because theyre used to the rapid interaction with the screen and could it again a question be that they are fidgety and hyperactive and then diagnosed as having a disorder
7461265 what we need to question is this are we putting people into the optimum environment how can we create an environment which will pre dispose the brain to react in ways we consider ideal
7461266 the technology is creating an environment that is answer rich but were question poor

7461269 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7461270 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7461271 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7461272 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7461273 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7461274 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7461275 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7461276 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7461277 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7461278 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7461279 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7461280 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7461281 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7461282 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales

7461284 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7461285 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7461286 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7461287 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7461288 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7461289 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas

7461294 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania

7461301 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7461302 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

7461306 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7461307 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7461308 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7461309 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos

7461322 china secured its position as a world power with the olympic games in beijing
7461323 most olympic games so far have been staged in the developed countries but china has shown it can do it as well if not not better
7461324 beijing was the best olympic host of the past century
7461325 first class facilities first class organization that is what is being said about the games in beijing
7461326 but it was also noticeable that china did not do as well when it comes to human rights press freedom and democratization
7461327 the carefully orchestrated facade could not conceal a police state that tramples on human rights
7461328 very interesting development from the point of view of our project
7461329 a point that needs making is that judge harvey is no mug when it comes to the internet
7461330 on a technical level he probably knows more about the internet than any other judge in the country
7461331 this meeting will certainly improve bilateral relationship between the border guards of the two neighbours
7461332 we will fight for self determination for the region it is no longer a matter of land for the amarnath cave shrine
7461333 the agitation will gather momentum and people will take to the streets in large numbers whenever the curfew is lifted

7461337 javier will be back with us soon but i do not think he will be in contention to play in europe
7461338 he has spent too much time travelling and playing that makes it difficult to be at your best
7461339 the same thing applied to ryan babel he returned from china last week after holland were knocked out but i only really considered him as a substitute at the weekend

7461342 allerdings konterkariert diese initiative die behutsame informationsarbeit der wahldurchf hrenden kommunen da die bmi initiative mehr verwirrung stiftet wird als sie zur information der bev lkerung beitragen kann
7461343 so oder so muss die kommune schriftlich oder m ndlich dem nicht wahlberechtigten ausl ndischen oder minderj hrigen antragsteller die unangenehme nachricht bermitteln dass trotz information des bmi mangels vorliegender voraussetzungen keine wahlkarte ausgestellt werden kann

7461345 i dont know how they can possibly reschedule it because you have to have a window of opportunity for all the cricketing nations to be available to play at a given stage next year
7461346 i would have thought it is highly unlikely to happen
7461347 baumwolle wird im konventionellen anbau intensiv mit pestiziden behandelt obwohl baumwolle nur auf vier prozent der weltweiten ackerfl che angebaut wird verschlingt sie 22 prozent der weltweit eingesetzten insektizide auch die gentechnik konnte diesen chemieeinsatz nicht verringern obwohl die chemikalienreduktion immer als argument f r den einsatz von gentechnik ins spiel gebracht wurde
7461348 she said you won you won you won nothing else to say there just listening to each other smile on the phone
7461349 the best thing they could do was play great volleyball they cant control what had happened and probably are going to try to comprehend the magnitude of that event later but what we can do is try to play the best we can
7461350 i thought that was a real good way for them to deal with it im very proud of their approach and their maturity
7461351 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7461352 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7461353 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7461354 the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
7461355 they have a lot more to spend now and they like spending it on sports
7461356 team sports are extremely popular in america and because of our culture its where we place our emphasis
7461357 but its far easier and less expensive to train one individual than it is 30 or 18 in a team sport
7461358 i was in the laundry and standing right next to nadal
7461359 i didnt bother him but he was shoving all his colors and whites in together
7461360 i really wanted to say dude youre going to have a nightmare with that you cant just put the whole bag in there are reds in with whites but what can you do
7461361 i just tried to soak in every moment and i had the time of my life we played in four cities in china and everywhere we went the volunteers and fans went out of their way to make us feel like olympians we leave china with a special fondness in our hearts for the people of this country
7461362 at some point in time in all our careers were going to win our last golf tournament and when you win it you obviously dont think thats going to be your last one
7461363 when i won this tournament in 06 i thought i was just going to light it up
7461364 i tackled tom about as well as usc tackled vince young
7461365 its safe to say its gone beyond my wildest expectations and my expectations were really high
7461366 they said i was through in 2006 which was ridiculous so ive been under the radar before and responded very big
7461367 i know i can compete in the open and i know this is the one slam that fits my game if it wasnt for a couple of injuries this would be a different conversation
7461368 everything was clicking i was playing as well as i ever had
7461369 he needs a big win in a major getting to the quarters is not going to do it
7461370 he needs a victory over nadal or federer or djokovic to spark him
7461371 he is like a shooter in basketball who can get hot his big serve can serve him well and andy knows better than most that any time he walks through the gates at flushing meadows something special can happen
7461372 it wasnt an easy decision and i knew it would haunt me but with what has gone on in the last four months i thought staying home was best for me
7461373 if he goes out and wins the u s open and gains a little confidence in not coming out here and changing time zones and dealing with the pressures of the olympics he made the right decision
7461374 im not going in under ideal conditions with the time ive missed
7461375 but the u s open is my home court slam its the one i gear up for and the one i really want to win again i was playing well in the beginning of the year and if i can find that level again im going to be dangerous
7461376 everyone wants to talk about the nba being selfish arrogant individuals what you saw was a team
7461377 american basketball where its supposed to be on the top of the world
7461378 the fact that we had this team for three years was the telling difference in this game
7461379 it was a great game it was a pressure game from the get go and we never cracked the fact that we were together for this period of time was the difference
7461380 those guys were hungry and wanted to get back to the top
7461381 we have a lot of players who are individually great wade said
7461382 you never want to get in a scoring battle with the hungarians because they are such great shooters said ryan bailey the u s man in the middle who took a beating in this physical sport known for its cheap shots under the waterline
7461383 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly everyone in the village is great
7461384 we could not be more proud of our athletes for everything they accomplished here in beijing both on and off the field of play
7461385 new stars were born stars from past games amazed us we shared their joy and their tears and we marveled at their ability
7461386 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7461387 we emphasize the fact that as flattering as being ranked no 1 is polls do not win games
7461388 that has to be done by the players on friday night
7461389 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against the public life so we decided to declare it banned
7461390 anyone having link with this organization promoting its literature and message helping it financially or in any other way will be taken to task according to the law
7461391 they fired rockets and entered the house after breaking the main gate they killed our five or six guards and then my elder brother and two nephews
7461392 i think now in my heart of the people who are close to me and especially the fans who came to china to cheer for me at the olympics
7461393 those things gave me the power to get the gold medal
7461394 i surprised myself because of giving up a slider for a home run
7461395 we got struggle time we got outstanding time just one day one game tomorrow were going to come back and win
7461396 i said hey in a couple of days well know if itll work
7461397 well i kind of fibbed to him i knew it would work
7461398 there was never a doubt that speed was a premium for us
7461399 we have to get faster thats the overriding thing when i watch the tapes
7461400 were looking for a bunch of guys who can fly to the football
7461401 i dont think our problems have been because of a lack of speed
7461402 weve got guys running 4 4s and 4 5s in the 40 it was just knowing where were supposed to go
7461403 theres a way to play quicker its understanding what youre doing to the point that its second nature to you
7461404 its a lot of fun to be in with all of the different stuff we can do and all of the formations and moving people around
7461405 every time he touches the ball theres a chance for a touchdown
7461406 theres been a lot of progress from when they came in
7461407 but depth is going to be a major concern for us
7461408 the more we kind of learned to fit it together the better we got
7461409 vons got a lot of different tools and at end he was kind of limited at linebacker there are three or four more things you can do with him
7461410 speeds important but it takes you only so far you have to fill your gap its about getting position
7461411 oh ive made so many of those in my career its hard to keep up with all of them
7461412 ive made so many mistakes in my career youd think i was trying to make things hard on myself
7461413 everybody makes mistakes i guess ive just made a few more but every mistake ive made has brought me here so it couldnt have been that bad
7461414 texas is a very polished team that has great talent texas has never been a really tough team physically tough team and thats what weve got to be when my defense will get to the point where i think itll get well be mean nasty ornery bastards and thats what you need to beat texas
7461415 theyll throw you tit for tat run the ball outside option throw theyll move the ball we can go out there with our defense and make them pay a price every time they catch one of those dinky passes get about three hats on him and make him not want to get up thats the way to beat texas
7461416 i was trying to talk about how talented of a team texas was and people took it the wrong way
7461417 namath came to me on the sideline and said coach i think i can sneak it in
7461418 i remember telling him to go do it then so namath goes out there and jumps and this linebacker comes out of nowhere and just stuffs him
7461419 we used to look at games like this when we played florida or south florida or texas as advanced training camp games
7461420 we knew we didnt have a chance to win so we just looked at them as preparation for our conference schedule it was advanced training camp
7461421 but this isnt advanced training camp anymore we quit playing advanced training camp games now were going to challenge everybody for victories

7461431 its quite an experience being on tour with the missus in america you get full on motorcades and 15 car escorts from the police
7461432 in london youre lucky if you get one rozzer its something else on show night there will be 20 levels of staff before you get through to see the missus
7461433 thats one thing about the missuss shows they are non stop

7461435 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled

7461442 there is no doubt that it was a great missed opportunity to prevent people like you who shaped the minds of the generation to come to israel and perform
7461443 growing up theres a lot of pressure on young women when you first become aware of your own looks in relation to other womens looks
7461444 you just want to be cookie cutter beautiful and sometimes you think maybe i could change something about myself to fit that mould im no exception to that
7461445 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7461446 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7461447 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7461448 theres so much that we dont know about this poll like were clinton backers even distinguished in july since they only tell us about their june opinions
7461449 the two were related by ancestry and united by destiny

7461453 there are already several new improved versions of the kindle in the works

7461861 our results revealed that a period of sleep following a new experience can consolidate and improve subsequent effects of learning from the experience
7461862 this improvement comes from changes in brain activity in specific regions that code for relevant features of the learned material
7461863 everybody sleeps but some people sleep less than the average population others have an abnormal sleep structure and some drugs may change the duration of specific sleep stages
7461864 we also need to better study the impact of sleep on brain development in children
7461865 we now want to know which brain circuits are involved in these learning effects during the night and if we can experimentally enhance such effects
7461866 we want to assess how sleep disorders affect emotional and cognitive functioning and what are the biological factors responsible for these effects

7461950 die kapitalgedeckte vorsorge beinhaltet zwar ebenfalls renditerisiken aber diese sind geringer als bei der gesetzlichen rentenversicherung
7461951 die wahrscheinlichkeit mit einem aktiendepot auf sicht von 30 jahren eine negative rendite zu erzielen ist an historischen werten gemessen praktisch null
7461952 das renditerisiko der gesetzlichen rentenversicherung ist im vergleich zum risiko von kapitalanlagen erheblich
7461953 die ergebnisse sprechen auf jeden fall f r eine hohe gewichtung der kapitalanlagen
7461954 da der umfang der gesetzlichen rentenversicherung vom gesetzgeber festgelegt wurde ist jedoch der spielraum f r eine erg nzende altersvorsorge begrenzt sodass zus tzlich m gliche sicherheitsgewinne nicht ausgesch pft werden

7461961 sonus wird bei der lieferung von neuen dienstleistungen mit telenet zusammenarbeiten da sein netzwerk das ber 3 2 millionen umsatzbringende einheiten unterst tzt expandiert um moderne unternehmenskunden zu erreichen
7461962 sonus hat sich verpflichtet innovative l sungen f r die kabelindustrie aufzubauen die wahrhaft einzigartig in ihrer kompatibilit t sind ich glaube dass diese partnerschaft ein weiterer beweis f r das wachstum ist das sonus in europa erfahren hat sowie f r unseren erfolg als dienstleistungsunternehmen f r kabelanbieter auf der ganzen welt

7461974 pertama doktor itu perlu mempunyai maklumat mengenai kejadian yang didakwa oleh mangsa kemudian menjalankan ujian kesihatan yang penuh membuat pemeriksaan menyeluruh di bahagian sulit mangsa dan membuat siasatan
7461975 doktor perlu menghantar spesimen daripada diri mangsa kepada unit forensik semua ini mesti lengkap kita tidak boleh buat kesimpulan seseorang itu menjadi mangsa salah laku seks hanya daripada pemeriksaan awal
7461976 tolong jangan terpengaruh dengan apa yang didakwa sebagai laporan perubatan ini kerana ia tidak lengkap pertama sekali kita tidak tahu sama ada laporan yang tersiar dalam risalah itu sahih atau tidak laporan perubatan perlu disahkan
7461977 kami mahu menyoal doktor itu tetapi nampaknya dia tak dapat dihubungi daripada risalah itu dia menolak berlaku perbuatan liwat tetapi ini tidak mengesahkan apa apa
7461978 the opinion of the security forces is that the risk resulting from their release is low
7461979 the israeli government is making a big mistake by releasing now terrorists now with blood on their hands the first time for many years
7461980 and the lesson to the region is that terror pay s off
7461981 you are now putting him in a situation that he is the same like hamas both of them want terrorists back in the yard
7461982 these 200 it takes israel one week to 10 days to re arrest them
7461983 can in fact deliver much more for their own people than the extremists than the terrorists ever can
7461984 we have more political legal grounds than kosovo to have our independence recognized

7461986 vi oplever at det er bremset op p markedet for fritidshuse allerede med kreditkrisens begyndelse for et rs tid siden kunne vi m rke d rligere tider og nu kan man virkelig m rke at danskerne ikke har s meget at g re godt med til investeringer

7461991 this may be the single most amazing interview i have ever watched on
7461992 i think historians a hundred years from now will puzzle over how it could be that the united states of america the most powerful nation in the world as far back as the early 1970s came to recognize that dependence on foreign oil was a problem posed a threat comprised our freedom of action
7461993 for me robinho is the same player as always he is an important player who should be part of this project
7461994 i think that he knows that he can be successful at real madrid it is a subject that you need to resolve in the best way possible but we are all selfish and the best would be that he stays with us for a long time
7461995 the board have accepted the bid hes not renegotiated his contract and the decision was taken out of my hands
7461996 i dont know where anton is in terms of signing for sunderland but once the club accept the bid it moves on

7462001 i dont want to lose it i want to win things for the club i want to get experience here i want to play for arsenal

7462004 you guys have all seen the rubbish thats been written in the papers in the last couple of weeks and its nice to just put it to bed now
7462005 its been unsettling for everyone including roque himself and were absolutely delighted at the club

7462007 i dont know where anton is in terms of signing for sunderland but once the club accept the bid it moves on
7462008 if nothing else weve got to match uniteds work rate thats what weve done every time weve got a good result against them and thats what we have to do again or we will be punished by their quality

7462022 beh a meno che tu non voglia ancora attaccarmi vorrei parlarti
7462023 mi chiedevo perch sei cos amara verso la nostra razza
7462024 credimi che sapr cosa tramate tu e la tua banda di randagi

7462038 cuidado no llevemos la discusi n a pretender fijar en exceso la reducci n salarial que nos lleve a abrir una v a de conflictividad
7462039 no se puede querer imputar el peso de la situaci n exclusivamente a los salarios
7462040 hay empresas que est n registrando balances con unos beneficios muy potentes por tanto habr que hacer sacrificios en las dos direcciones
7462041 puedo estar de acuerdo con que se congele el sueldo de los ministros y de los altos cargos pero este mensaje no se le puede trasladar a una persona que cobra 1 000 euros al mes porque ya est haciendo un sacrificio cada d a
7462042 me parece injusto que el sector financiero prejubile a una persona con 52 a os y un trabajador que est en el andamio tenga que estar trabajando hasta los 65 a os
7462043 una sociedad que se quiera amparar sobre las espaldas de una generaci n entre los 30 y 50 a os m s tarde o m s temprano es una sociedad que entra en crisis

7462048 pemerintah tidak pernah tegas terhadap investor selain itu koordinasi antara departemen esdm dengan depkeu selama ini juga sangat lemah akibatnya pemerintah dalam posisi yang lemah untuk melaksanakan peraturan yang dibuatnya sendiri
7462049 peraturan pemerintah justru membuat negara dalam posisi yang lemah maka pemerintah perlu review kontrak pertambangan
7462050 kita harus punya prosedur baku untuk memaksimalkan pendapatan dari pertambangan jangan sampai pengusahanya yang masuk jajaran orang terkaya namun kewajiban terhadap negara tidak dibayar
7462051 karena pemegang saham pengendali inilah yang berkuasa di perusahaan perusahaan tersebut
7462052 tidak bisa orang menggabungkan dua objek hukum yang berbeda jadi royalti harus tetap dibayar urusan restitusi ppn tergantung pada keputusan hukum nantinya
7462053 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us

7462061 showing that big government breeds vice does not require the assumption that politicians are in some way malevolent or that widespread immorality is their intention indeed let us assume the contrary a hypothetical world of entirely well meaning and sincere politicians who believe that expanding government will ultimately improve the lives of the general public they do not intend to do harm through their policies but the harm ensues nonetheless we need only several illustrations to see this unfortunate tendency at work
7462062 heres an open secret obama and his most fervent supporters dont wonder why people mock his remarkable and frequently very troubling pretentiousness and grandiosity they know perfectly well why these qualities are mocked they simply prefer that people succumb to obama mania or failing that refrain from all criticism remarks such as those directly above are not at all unusual for obama they constitute his normal frame of reference they would appear to reflect his considered judgment as to his own role in american and world history now that is disturbing and perhaps even disturbed i have written about why i regard anyone who would want to be president and who affirmatively seeks to hold that kind of power of life and death over many millions of people as deeply suspect in psychological terms but most politicians are at least sufficiently astute to keep the self reverential paeans more muted but we should give obama his due he unquestionably wins the self pleasuring championship

7462068 la decisi n de no hacer jugar a robinho ha sido m a

7462071 esto pasa muy pocas veces para m es la primera nunca lo viv como jugador ni como entrenador pero el f tbol siempre depara sorpresas confiaba en que hay equipos como el valencia que tienen problemas de jugar con uno o dos m s hemos tenido la suerte de que no han sabido jugar con esa ventaja
7462072 un equipo tiene que tener una mentalidad el a o pasado la demostr y contra todas las dificultades que podemos tener hoy en d a lo hemos vuelto a hacer
7462073 la reacci n del equipo ha sido positiva creyeron que se pod a ir a por el partido y en la segunda parte vimos un partido muy bonito emocionante y justo por la entrega de todos los jugadores que estuvieron en el campo
7462074 no vamos a cerrar los ojos solo por el triunfo y la forma de la que lo hemos hecho
7462075 hay una base de equipo que nos gusta pero vamos a estar despiertos hasta el ltimo d a a ver si algo es posible pero somos el real madrid y fichar o traer gente es m s complicado que para otros equipos no va a ser f cil

7462079 m s del 50 de los atletas del equipo han competido bien otros no pero eso no se puede arreglar no te puedes meter en el cuerpo del atleta ferm n cacho se nace y marta dom nguez tambi n se nace no es algo que se hace
7462080 nosotros hacemos un atletismo artesanal casi familiar el sistema consiste en ayudar mucho a la gente esta es la federaci n que m s dinero recibe del estado aunque ahora con la crisis a ver qu tiempos vienen pero ste espa a es tambi n un pa s que tiene futbolitis galopante lo que se refleja por ejemplo en la atenci n de los medios nosotros peleamos por nuestras migajas tambi n nos cuesta admitir a los atletas nacionalizados

7462271 at some considerable public expense and inconvenience to a lot of people i had to stop the trial
7462272 its possible that every member of this jury panel will have heard about read about or seen some report or comment about this case over the past few years
7462273 the court is anxious to ensure that every juror who tries this case can be completely impartial
7462274 you are absolutely forbidden to make your own inquiries about this trial
7462275 they have arrested one of our mps here in the chamber we hear that they are also looking for a total of 15 of our members of parliament as part of an evil ploy to rig the elections for parliamentary speaker

7462326 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behaviour and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people
7462327 but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behaviour are not well understood
7462328 this latest study used functional brain imaging to identify the circuits in the brain that underpin our ability to differentiate social behaviour that conforms to our values from behaviour that does not
7462329 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
7462330 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
7462331 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
7462332 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
7462333 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention

7462430 het is vaak zo dat er gedreigd wordt met het inzetten van milieuwetgeving met het verscherpen van randvoorwaarden en dergelijke waarbij de traditionele maatschappijen eigenlijk gedwongen worden eerdere afspraken op te geven en dat zie je dus in rusland gebeuren in latijns amerika en in venezuela
7462431 het is over het algemeen niet zoals in landen met een stabiele middenklasse met gereguleerde economische activiteiten en industrie dat dit geld in de economie terechtkomt er worden niet per se allerlei productieve dingen mee gedaan het leidt juist tot politieke strijd of strijd tussen verschillende bevolkingsgroepen over de controle over het staatsapparaat en daarmee over de inkomsten uit die olie

7462452 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7462453 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7462454 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7462455 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
7462456 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy

7462464 some people may think this is a harsh decision for this university because im such a stickler about doing the little things but one thing i do know is that if you forget about the little things they add up to the big things were going to build a championship team and were going to do it the right way
7462465 im glad im at an organization where your actions are accountable i made a mistake im sorry for what i did it was an accident of course id take it back if i could but i believe in coach shannon and coach shannon said i needed to do this so if its best for the team thats what im going to do
7462466 i wanted him to have a competition just to compete like normal
7462467 i trust whatever he did i messed up he didnt mess up im just proud to be here it is what it is i believe in the coaching staff here and i believe in this team
7462468 hes a great coach he makes things happen and im just happy that im here at the miami right now with these great opportunities
7462469 im a team player im not too worried about whats going to happen in the future im worried about whats going to happen now i just have to go out there and make something happen the first game
7462470 i know myself and i know im not one who is going to
7462471 im just going out there trying to get better every day
7462472 ive been like that my entire life no matter whatever situation ive been in

7462474 everybody wants things to go their way but im not the only person in the world that has problems
7462475 no question i want to be on the field and i want to play im a competitor dont ever mistake that but i understand it didnt shake out this time for whatever reason i dont get upset i just get ready for the next opportunity
7462476 ja zeg ik kan echt wel een stukje vlees bakken hoor

7462487 i remember how silly you looked the first time we met with that bowl of soup streaming down your shirt
7462488 zu glauben wir sind in wenigen tagen mit der berpr fung aller spuren und hinweise durch ist nicht realistisch

7462491 a process of unfolding like the evolution of an embryo in which the whole precedes its parts and actually gives birth to them by splitting
7462492 dirk riehle and heinz zullighoven give a nice definition of the term
7462493 descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context
7462494 is often used to refer to any pattern which directly addresses issues of software architecture design or programming implementation many choose to make an important distinction between these three conceptual levels by categorizing them into
7462495 riehle and zullighoven make similar distinctions but seem to partition the different kinds of patterns among analysis design and implementation they define the terms
7462496 every pattern we define must be formulated in the form of a rule which establishes a relationship between a context a system of forces which arises in that context and a configuration which allows these forces to resolve themselves in that context
7462497 first there is a picture which shows an archetypal example of the pattern
7462498 patterns are applied by the means of piecemeal growth applying one pattern provides a context for the application of the next pattern
7462499 they are extracted from physics and mathematics by looking at how nature is put together i discovered these laws by observing how fundamental particles come together to form a structure
7462500 the kind of order that is achieved when there is a perfect balance between the needs of the parts and the needs of the whole
7462501 thus as in the case of natural languages the pattern language is generative it not only tells us the rules of arrangement but shows us how to construct arrangements as many as we want which satisfy the rules
7462502 a pattern language gives each person who uses it the power to create an infinite variety of new and unique buildings just as his ordinary language gives him the power to create an infinite variety of sentences
7462503 the structure of the language is created by the network of connections among individual patterns and the language lives or not as a totality to the degree these patterns form a whole
7462504 each pattern then depends both on the smaller patterns it contains and on the larger patterns within which it is contained
7462505 the language is a good one capable of making something whole when it is morphologically and functionally complete
7462506 planning and construction will be guided by a process which allows the whole to emerge gradually from local acts
7462507 communication of architectural knowledge among developers accommodating a new design paradigm or architectural style resolving nonfunctional forces such as reusability portability and extensibility and avoiding development traps and pitfalls that have traditionally been learned only by experience
7462508 modelling the real world application of patterns to reduce complexity in the software development process

7462512 gender roles were something that no sci fi writer or futurist of the era seemed to think would change
7462513 a typical vacation in 2008 is to spend a week at an undersea resort where your hotel room window looks out on a tropical underwater reef a sunken ship or an ancient excavated city available to guests are two and three person submarines in which you can cruise well marked underwater trails
7462514 you simply press a combination of buttons and the pages flash on your home screen the world s information is available to you almost instantaneously
7462515 willy gender roles were something that no sci fi writer or futurist of the era seemed to think would change gene roddenberry says hello but i guess there s a difference between predicting 40 years and 300 years into the future

7462693 spencers basic thesis is that the essence of quaker spirituality as seen in the history of the movement is holiness understood as the direct experience of god culminating in divine union this perfection is the culmination of a work of divine grace and is sustained by a synergy of grace and works i e loving god and neighbour and obeying the indwelling christ the quakers desired to create contemplative communities of committed spiritually awakened people they built radical monastic like communities of disciples that adopted some subversive practices including simplicity and pacifism the quakerism she tracks through history is christ centred bible based honest spirit filled discipleship focused and very deeply inspiring

7462876 people just launched into action there was a buzz in the unit
7462877 one of the most modern bases in the air force
7462878 is not part of the norad north american aerospace defense command air sovereignty force and did not have an alert mission
7462879 capable and ready response forces for the district of columbia in the event of a natural disaster or civil emergency

7462881 we practice scrambles i e taking off as fast as possible to inspect enemy aircraft we know how to do intercepts and other things
7462882 still contain ed all the nellis data from the red flag training exercise they just returned from
7462883 do you have any additional information are you guys going to need some help

7462886 then the secret service agent told us to stand by and that somebody else would call
7462887 as dcang is a general purpose f 16 unit no one was specifically tasked with keeping the squadron informed
7462888 first inkling that the attacks would go beyond new york was when one of his officers whose husband worked at the pentagon saw on television that the building had been hit and began shrieking

7462923 in terms of economic growth it doesnt have any impact
7462924 were going down from stupidly fast last year to really fast this year and just plain ordinary fast next year which would be in the 8 9 percent range
7462925 its a big downshift and that may create some problems but theyll still be growing faster than any other major economy in the world
7462926 today it is clear that after georgias aggression against south ossetia that georgian south ossetian and georgian abkhazian relations cannot be returned to their former state
7462927 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to get independence
7462928 we will look today at the appeals from the peoples of abkhazia and south ossetia to recognize the independence of these republics i think that all these decisions will be accepted
7462929 getting a ceasefire stopping hostilities and the troop withdrawal in eight days thats quite a lot already well have to see we have to take stock of the situation
7462930 the federation council of the russian federation taking into account multiple appeals by south ossetia and abkhazia on recognizing their independence including those received on august 22 and 24 2008 proposes to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia
7462931 this is a great joy for our mothers and our people but it remains a small step because we left behind us thousands of prisoners
7462932 its not easy to release prisoners especially prisoners that were involved directly in terrorist acts against innocent civilians
7462933 demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system in concentrating energies to accomplish grand feats
7462934 the government has used the olympics to display its organizing strength and win over the public with a new kind of self confident nationalism
7462935 perhaps western powers should expect fewer rather than more concessions from china
7462936 the chinese nations olympic dream has always been bound to its course of national revival
7462937 the beijing olympic games have added impetus for national self confidence
7462938 ordinary people will now have a stronger sense that their country really is a rising power
7462939 gold medals dont say everything because chinas sports are state backed but after all to win so many gold medals shouldnt be slighted as a sign of rising prosperity and power
7462940 sports are just sports but this success will intensify foreign fears that china is becoming a successful authoritarian government confident in itself that can chart its own course
7462941 we want to make sure people know exactly who sen obama is and where he wants to take the country and two that voters know their choice in this election between barack obama who wants to fundamentally change the way business is done in washington and john mccain who is just more of the same of what we have had over the course of the last eight years
7462942 hes got to be focused simple and clear rather than elegiac this is not a great novel this is a short clear focused discussion unless it is clear and real simple he has failed
7462943 obama certainly hasnt opened up any huge lead over john mccain in a year that should be an easy year for a democratic candidate
7462944 i think the country still wants to know who barack obama is and where he wants to take the country in a more specific direction than he has given
7462945 you cant lose the change mantra but youve got to continue to indict mccain
7462946 the bottom line is do you want four more years when they leave the convention they need to have fairly vetted that and answered that question
7462947 the guys got a great story and people dont know it

7462955 there is a general trend towards more lifestyle home improvement centers where a wider target audience is influencing the choices and making the purchase decisions and in 2007 we took the decision to invest in a more sophisticated showroom incorporating new product lines and catering to an expanded customer base while at the same time not losing sight of our roots
7462956 our relationship with fusiondesign began in 2004 and for the past four years theyve been responsible for our creative strategy design printing and implementation of all our marketing needs we consulted with them at the outset of our expansion and together we researched analysed and put the right plan and design solution in place
7462957 the new showroom was really the catalyst for our rebrand by creating a one stop shop for homeowners diy enthusiasts and professional contractors ahm were able to eliminate the need for consumers in their geographic area to travel greater distances for inspiration ideas and sourcing of interior design and building materials
7462958 longstanding client relations are what fusiondesign is known for more often than not were the outsourced marketing and creative department for companies that really need marketing support but who prefer to work with outsourced partners to facilitate this by really understanding the ahm brand we were able to make the best recommendations for their business in addition to executing the roll out of the new brand were delighted with the outcome not only from a design perspective but the increase in revenue and customers that ahm have acquired is where we believe marketing should fundamentally be measured

7462963 obviously the referees do bottle it because they keep making the same mistakes all the time
7462964 i was marking mcmanus at the corner and it was just a plain handball it was obvious i could have knocked the ref out to be honest
7462965 i was surprised that i didnt get booked to be honest because i kept having a go at him all the time he didnt book me when i kicked the ball away so that just shows how inconsistent that referee is

7462968 tata sky is an amalgamation of the tata group and the sky brand which is owned by the uk based british sky broadcasting group however a lot of consumers believe that the word sky in our brand name implies to the satellite service that comes from the sky hence this campaigns main objective is to educate people about the origins of our brand also we wanted someone who is not only trusted by the consumers but has also earned the respect to educate them therefore we chose aamir khan since he is a perfect fit for the tata sky brand this is because he embodies the brand proposition of tata sky completely trust and integrity additionally just like khan we too incessantly strive for perfection whether in the field of technology and innovation or in leadership and performance

7463001 i feel were probably one of the teams and i think theyre all about the same really between fourth and twelfth we could have finished anywhere up to fourth matthews said
7463002 were going to finish tenth or eleventh so therefore thats a failure
7463003 weve failed to end up where i think were capable of doing
7463004 we had seven games that have been decided by less than two goals and we lost three and won four matthews said
7463005 theyre the ones you tend to think if youre in front with a few minutes to go thats where you feel like you should be able to now protect the lead for a few minutes
7463006 one of the things that you always do at the end of the season and players should as well is ask how many players had career best years or how many players played as well as they have before
7463007 over the whole season there would be more that would look back and say no i didnt have a great year
7463008 some might say i had a poor year some might say i had an okay year but there would only be a handful that probably have felt yeah this is my best year that ive had in my footy career
7463009 i feel like weve got more upside in our players than weve got logical downsides so i still think were on the up he said
7463010 the road map to peace only moves in one direction and that direction is from the west bank to the mediterranean sea the only thing in the way is israel

7463014 its not easy for israel to release prisoners some of the individuals being released today are guilty of direct involvement in the murder of innocent civilians

7463018 however they were no more likely to have been coerced into sexual activity and were not significantly more likely to be unhappy or anxious
7463019 people with these sexual interests have long been seen by medicine and the law as at best damaged and in need of therapy and at worst dangerous and in need of legal regulation
7463020 and need particularly strong stimuli such as being beaten or tied up to become aroused
7463021 ik heb een geweldige tentoonstelling gezien met m in het rap allemaal ontwerpen voor huizen die je kunt bouwen op een kavel bij de gasfabriek

7463031 a pesar de habernos emocionado mucho tambi n lo hemos pasado muy bien recordando an cdotas de roc o era una persona muy divertida
7463032 un ejemplo a seguir un espejo en el que verme reflejado cada d a a pesar del ambiente bohemio que rodea siempre a los artistas ella siempre fue una gran matriarca para todos sus allegados una persona sencilla con unos golpes de humor que nos dejaban a todos boquiabiertos
7463033 roc o pidi expresamente que colaborara yo como contertulio siempre que pudo colaborar con el desarrollo de mi carrera lo hizo estar eternamente agradecido por haber tenido la oportunidad de conocerla
7463034 la gala hubiera funcionado tan bien en todo momento se not una conexi n entre los artistas y el p blico todos unidos para rendir pleites a a una de las personalidades m s grandes que ha tenido la canci n espa ola
7463035 roc o siempre ha estado vinculada al flamenco de hecho empez su imparable trayectoria en los tablaos de madrid junto a su madre en su etapa m s madura tambi n terminaba todas sus actuaciones con alg n tema puramente flamenco lo que algunos escritores llamaron el beso de despedida
7463036 la propuesta del gobierno es la de reducir un 70 la potencia m xima a instalar por lo que tambi n afectar a al resto de sectores implicados con la industria fotovoltaica en ese mismo porcentaje
7463037 podr an desaparecer m s de 3 000 empleos directos pero si sumamos los indirectos las cifras se disparan porque afecta a otros sectores como el transporte por ejemplo
7463038 las medidas del gobierno son un poco contradictorias y es que su discurso es el de una apuesta clara por las energ as renovables y sin embargo su propuesta es restrictiva
7463039 de los 1 000 o 1 200 megavatios que hemos instalado en un a o tendremos que pasar a 300 en el a o 2009
7463040 no habr financiaci n se frenar por la inquietud que genera la reordenaci n y lo que pasa es que estas instalaciones se amortizan a medio y largo plazo

7463048 ok this is actually good were getting more town wide involvement
7463049 this is not going well what am i going to tell our donors
7463050 we are in agreement draft up the requirements of our commitment to one another and well look it over
7463051 ok we flex now its going to be just a chicken project we can deal with that it actually simplifies things
7463052 i like these guys to my american pace it felt like it took us a millenium to get things figured out but they carefully talked it through and their whole hearts are in this they really want a successful project for all these hiv infected families
7463053 at that stage turnbull handed over kennedys notes which detailed what packer was planning
7463054 this was done with some melodrama turnbull said to westerway i fear for myself my family for my career
7463055 as i watch whats happening in the liberal leadership he seems to be riding a very clever tour de france sort of race
7463056 hes sitting in behind sheltered from the wind ready to make his move whenever he chooses
7463057 my understanding is that he has voluntarily stepped aside my understanding is that there is an inquiry in place
7463058 i would think the dpp would be keen to get this wound up sooner rather than later
7463059 we have yet to see the evidence that this kind of approach will work
7463060 it is extremely punitive it will have an immediate and severe effect on peoples lives
7463061 on the one hand theyre punishing kids for the mistakes of their parents but theyre refusing to punish adults for their own acts of non compliance
7463062 were certainly not going to commit to anything until weve seen the detail
7463063 there should be no withdrawal of welfare payments without a commensurate involvement of advisers and support for parents
7463064 we want kids to be in school we want that generation of children to succeed in their lives in the future and getting a great quality education is the absolute foundation stone of that
7463065 we view that as so important that we are prepared to take this measure
7463066 were talking about the need for all children to both be enrolled and attend school on a regular basis
7463067 singer guitarist bo bice spent his youth moving between georgia alabama and florida before the family relocated to england when he was twelve

7463069 it was important for us to find a provider that could help support our global growth
7463070 reliance globalcom has helped us mitigate risk in the face of massive network expansion
7463071 similar to enterprises in other industries law firms are capitalizing on the opportunities presented by a world economy
7463072 its imperative for firms like paul hastings to have a single reliable global communications provider with an extensive and robust network with our international reach and more miles of fiber than any other ethernet carrier reliance globalcom has become a true partner in growth with these organizations

7463083 our roads are bad and need to be tarred we also dont have a clinic community hall or a high school in our area
7463084 i am an assistant foreman at a chrome mine in swartklip i have two children who are both attending a primary school
7463085 i would however like to tell the president that we need our roads tarred we need a high school and the facilities at the local george stegman hospital need to improve
7463086 i come from mooinooi in brits which is under the madibeng local municipality and there are three mines which operate around our community
7463087 the mining companies go to rustenburg to get their labour though and dont employ the unemployed people from our village
7463088 i would like to ask for president mbeki to encourage the mining companies to work with government to help reduce unemployment in our community
7463089 this programme provides llb graduates with an opportunity to serve their articles through university law clinics ulcs as well as giving legal services to disadvantaged communities

7463139 an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7463140 i know him very well and i know he has been on the front lines of the fight for social and economic justice his entire time in public service
7463141 i have a responsibility i do not own my vote i have to represent the voters who sent me
7463142 i was sent to denver to vote for clinton i would be letting my voters down if i voted for anyone else
7463143 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7463144 theres a lot of pressure on the players but we just to have wind it up
7463145 theres nothing else we can do no one is going to feel sorry for us and when then transfer window closes we have who we have
7463146 its not as if we can just say hang on a second and just press pause weve got to play and weve got to grind it out
7463147 saturday was a classic example of that it was a class goal from ossie which we know he can create but look at the goal yak scored thats not a yakubu goal thats more a case of grinding it out and chasing it down so thats what its going to take
7463148 myself and joleon and jo joseph yobo we just talked about trying to get on the same page
7463149 but its only the second game of the season and it only happens by playing games unfortunately being able to click without even thinking or speaking
7463150 but its those times and those moments in those games that help you sort it out so by the fifth sixth seventh game youre just rolling
7463151 its disappointing for the boys they obviously want to be in every england squad that is only natural for top players like them
7463152 fabio capello has to pick his own team and his own squad
7463153 we are muslims and recognize too that the issue is beyond human so any further inquiries into the matter contradict the philosophy of my religion for hadiza is gone forever and deserve prayers for the repose of her gentle soul
7463154 the girl was found in the pool of her own blood in the toilet situated 50 metres away from the main building penultimate wednesday
7463155 none of our family members could exactly tell you the cause of her death she could neither have committed suicide hadizas death remains strange and mysterious to us
7463156 i was not at home when the incident happened but my wife did report that she trailed hadiza to the toilet around 9 30 p m and found she had been slaughtered there
7463157 the incident drew a crowd and the police were alerted in good time the police on arrival conducted preliminary investigation and took the lifeless body to the murtala muhammad general hospital for post mortem examination
7463158 hadiza is a gentle girl she talked less and did not keep large circle of friends she opted out of secondary school and settled for islamic studies and exhibited total dedication to her religious duties and would not have taken her life no matter the circumstance
7463159 a lot of suitors had indicated their interest to engage her as wife and she never introduced any one of them to the family until recently when she formally introduced one ibrahim of dorayi karshen waya and we did what was expected of us in a traditional way
7463160 ive said all along we need to bring in six or seven players this week
7463161 but ive not brought in one in however many weeks so there you go
7463162 i think we will be looking at loans and well be trying all routes these are the last days of the sales and theres not much left
7463163 i hope to get maybe a couple but for the quality i feel i need to get for us to continue i dont know if you can get that with just a few days to go
7463164 my wife and i just entered the house from school at about 7 30pm when we heard a gun shot three minutes later one of my other three younger ones living with me came to tell me that abduraheem had been shot and that he did not know whether he was still alive
7463165 he was just trying to enter his room when the person pointed gun at him and shot him in the dark and immediately left after the shooting

7463171 if he had the exact same agenda and he was a white male named stanley smith he would crush john mccain
7463172 america needs to face one of its foremost demons in the face and deal with it once and for all racism
7463173 quite honestly we have to ask ourselves is this nation ready for a black president
7463174 this election will be an interesting barometer of where we really stand socially

7463179 ich brauche nur f nf minuten lang fox news sehen und schon bin ich so sauer dass ich eine weitere episode schreiben muss
7463180 er schaute nicht zur ck auf die guten alten zeiten er hantierte mit dem hier und jetzt
7463181 den zuschauern einen film zu pr sentieren der f r sich steht f r den man
7463182 mir erscheint diese interpretation etwas einseitig er miller scheint sich auf den sex und die gewalt zu konzentrieren diese elemente kamen zwar in vielen der geschichten vor aber ich glaube nicht dass es darum in der serie geht der comic war letztlich optimistisch egal was f r dreckige dinge dem spirit darin geschahen
7463183 es ist ein licht angegangen aber ich wei nicht was es zu bedeuten hat
7463184 ich habe von anfang an mit dem sprit geknausert das hat sich heute ausgezahlt
7463185 schade dass es heute nicht zum sieg gereicht hat denn timo und ich waren das ganze wochenende die schnellsten in der lmp2 klasse
7463186 mein start war sehr gut ich konnte meine f hrung in meinem stint immer weiter ausbauen
7463187 ich h tte zwar gerne wieder auf dem siegertreppchen gestanden aber in der meisterschaft haben wir noch zehn punkte vorsprung n chstes wochenende werden wir in detroit wieder angreifen und unsere f hrung hoffentlich weiter ausbauen
7463188 ich bin bergl cklich erneut auf dem podium zu stehen dieses ergebnis zeigt wie gut das team arbeitet
7463189 meine boxenmannschaft hat uns heute wieder einmal super schnell abgefertigt den mechanikern verdanken wir einen gro en teil unseres heutigen erfolges
7463190 aus einem noch zu analysierenden grund ist die kraftstoffstrategie beim rs spyder mit startnummer sieben heute nicht aufgegangen das m ssen und werden wir genauestens berpr fen
7463191 abgesehen von dieser panne haben die porsche teams heute eine tolle leistung gezeigt die boxenstopps waren extrem schnell und die fahrer haben einen tollen job gemacht

7463197 ideea de baz este c nu avem prea multe p rghii pe care s le putem folosi
7463198 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar
7463199 warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
7463200 we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter
7463201 the groups are smaller and the teaching methods are more focused applied and intensive
7463202 my father suggested that i come here i didnt want to do it at first but its made such a big difference to my life i was so shy before and i didnt have any goals now im so much more confident and my family tell me that i have changed a lot

7463211 weve offered to make the series against india as a test case
7463212 the participating nations that have had security concerns have been invited to send independent security experts to review and assess the arrangements made for the series against india
7463213 we are very confident that things will get better next year and we will deliver a memorable champions trophy
7463214 even india had decided not to participate had the event been relocated
7463215 all the money which we have spent so far on hosting the tournament has come from the icc so we have no losses there
7463216 but we would have lost a considerable amount which is given to the hosting country if the tournament was cancelled

7463219 its going to be very exciting i think your mother instincts really kick in the day you find out that youre pregnant and for me its been a blast preparing for it getting the nursery ready and all that so were both really looking forward to it
7463220 today we must fulfill what is i think our historic mission to defend small countries from aggressors
7463221 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian state
7463222 at first it was like what we were used to sometimes before
7463223 then it just kept getting worse and worse and worse
7463224 nobody told us about any mistreatment any cruelty by the georgians as they entered the houses
7463225 but after what i have seen i still think the georgian army is shameful
7463226 that bloke from oasis said i couldnt play guitar somebody shouldve told him im a fuckin rocstar today is gonna be the day that im gonna throw it back to you
7463227 in it then we just tell python to print out whatever is inside the
7463228 string and the exclamation mark at the start of the
7463229 string they help format the output and make it look nice so that the strings dont all run together edit

7463231 we are pleased with the turn up and we hope the industry will continue to grow
7463232 another one of our members of parliament eliah jembere has been arrested at parliament
7463233 its clearly a strategy to eliminate our members and reverse our majority in parliament
7463234 we have been informed they want to arrest 15 mps its all about the vote for the speaker nothing to do with the law
7463235 in most capital cities petrol prices crept higher in the latest week after falling sharply over the past month
7463236 based on trends in the wholesale market the average pump price looks set to consolidate near 1 50 a litre
7463237 the average motorist is now forking out around 209 a month on petrol a saving of around 20 from the highs in mid july but still up 40 a month on a year ago
7463238 fuelwatch wont work wont give the benefits to consumers that its meant to
7463239 if the wholesale price is determined by the big oil companies and they also control many of the outlets its not a level playing field for those small operators those independent operators in the retail sector
7463240 central to our concerns is the fact that the proposal forces retail prices to be locked in for a 24 hour period
7463241 by banning the intra day price movements of fuel retailers motorists will ultimately pay more at the pump particularly those thousands of motorists that already shop smart and take advantage of the weekly discount cycle
7463242 we have yet to see the evidence that this kind of approach will work
7463243 it is extremely punitive it will have an immediate and severe effect on peoples lives
7463244 on the one hand theyre punishing kids for the mistakes of their parents but theyre refusing to punish adults for their own acts of non compliance
7463245 were certainly not going to commit to anything until weve seen the detail
7463246 there should be no withdrawal of welfare payments without a commensurate involvement of advisers and support for parents
7463247 we want kids to be in school we want that generation of children to succeed in their lives in the future and getting a great quality education is the absolute foundation stone of that
7463248 we view that as so important that we are prepared to take this measure
7463249 were talking about the need for all children to both be enrolled and attend school on a regular basis
7463250 in the northern territory one of the trial communities is the town of katherine where there are both indigenous and non indigenous children and of course in the suburb of cannington there will be more non indigenous children than indigenous
7463251 another one of our members of parliament eliah jembere has been arrested at parliament
7463252 its clearly a strategy to eliminate our members and reverse our majority in parliament
7463253 we have been informed they want to arrest 15 mps its all about the vote for the speaker nothing to do with the law
7463254 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7463255 make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
7463256 right after the conflict with georgia russia would look very indecent if it immediately annexed south ossetia and abkhazia
7463257 russia will be perfectly content if they are pseudo independent states
7463258 in most capital cities petrol prices crept higher in the latest week after falling sharply over the past month

7463264 i saw a wall of ice coming towards us and then we were carried 200 metres
7463265 there was absolutely no noise it was very disturbing we only had time to swerve to the right before being mowed down
7463266 if the snow melts and this might not happen because were close to the end of the summer its possible that the bodies will come to the surface if that happens well go and get them
7463267 it was a very very fine morning i went outside to see what the weather was like and i saw a line of lights moving up the mountain
7463268 i put on my harness i was ready to go i looked again and i asked myself am i dreaming then i understood
7463269 when i say scene from the apocalypse its because there were a lot of injured it was cold it was dark it was stressful
7463270 we found the first casualty who had a broken leg and after that we found a guide who had three broken vertebrae people with hypothermia people in panic people who had been through something horrific
7463271 they were white from head to foot but they were okay they went back to the shelter
7463272 they were long term residents in the bay margaret and ken had been here for over 40 years
7463273 they were your grandmother your grandfather your mum and dad there was nothing pretentious about them
7463274 theres been a fair bit of support for the family whether it be meatballs or letters that sort of thing
7463275 ive been speaking with them regularly over the last few days and considering what theyve gone through theyve got incredible support from the community and family and friends
7463276 they were long term residents in the bay margaret and ken had been here for over 40 years
7463277 they were your grandmother your grandfather your mum and dad there was nothing pretentious about them
7463278 theres been a fair bit of support for the family whether it be meatballs or letters that sort of thing
7463279 ive been speaking with them regularly over the last few days and considering what theyve gone through theyve got incredible support from the community and family and friends
7463280 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7463281 make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
7463282 right after the conflict with georgia russia would look very indecent if it immediately annexed south ossetia and abkhazia
7463283 russia will be perfectly content if they are pseudo independent states

7463291 they were white from head to foot but they were okay they went back to the shelter
7463292 we are investing in additional capacity at a time of unprecedented global demand for alumina and aluminium he said structures and career paths shift
7463293 today we must fulfill what is i think our historic mission to defend small countries from aggressors
7463294 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian state
7463295 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7463296 he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7463297 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7463298 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7463299 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7463300 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7463301 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7463302 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7463303 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7463304 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7463305 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7463306 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7463307 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7463308 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7463309 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7463310 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7463311 im pleased about the declaration and grateful to president bush
7463312 those calls have been coming in and at this point we have some teams coming in that will be doing a more detailed assessment where they will be going into these homes and looking at what type of damage theyve had
7463313 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7463314 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7463315 i dont think such a buildup will foster the stabilization of the atmosphere in the region
7463316 the systems that generate elections and earthquakes are complex systems
7463317 they are not predictable by simple equations but after coarse graining averaging they become predictable
7463318 we didnt look at it as reagan versus carter or republicans versus democrats or liberals versus conservatives rather we looked at elections as stability versus upheavals
7463319 typical of the pro obama dungeons amp dragons crowd from the comfort of moms basement
7463320 naturally gamers are not amused by the mccain campaigns quick resort to 80s era cultural stereotypes once mccain masters the internet were confident hell contemporize and start bashing video gamers instead
7463321 wields a fox cloak of deception with a 10 stun against nearby intelligent creatures
7463322 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7463323 suggests that battle for the presidency between the illinois senator and republican rival john mccain is all tied up
7463324 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7463325 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7463326 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7463327 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7463328 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7463329 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7463330 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7463331 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7463332 there is some worry that i might be a lightning rod
7463333 some of it is because i challenged the system at guant namo
7463334 i can see why muslims wanted to go underground after 9 11
7463335 but i have found that if you speak up in politics you can have a positive influence
7463336 by far the strongest advocate for following the geneva conventions for habeas corpus for following the constitution for everyone and for reaching out to all faiths
7463337 that theyll now read from the quran at a national political convention that shows we have come a long way in this country
7463338 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7463339 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7463340 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7463341 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7463342 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7463343 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7463344 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7463345 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7463346 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7463347 a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america it is a cultural war
7463348 hello george this is ron reagan id like to go over to the convention and announce that youre my choice for vice president if thats alright with you
7463349 government is like a big baby an alimentary canal with a big appetite at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other
7463350 we believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant
7463351 should and will take actions to reduce the emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions
7463352 coal will continue to play a large and indispensable role in a greenhouse gas constrained world
7463353 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7463354 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7463355 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7463356 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7463357 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7463358 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7463359 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7463360 we have yet to see the evidence that this kind of approach will work
7463361 it is extremely punitive it will have an immediate and severe effect on peoples lives
7463362 on the one hand theyre punishing kids for the mistakes of their parents but theyre refusing to punish adults for their own acts of non compliance
7463363 were certainly not going to commit to anything until weve seen the detail
7463364 there should be no withdrawal of welfare payments without a commensurate involvement of advisers and support for parents
7463365 we want kids to be in school we want that generation of children to succeed in their lives in the future and getting a great quality education is the absolute foundation stone of that
7463366 we view that as so important that we are prepared to take this measure
7463367 were talking about the need for all children to both be enrolled and attend school on a regular basis
7463368 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7463369 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7463370 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7463371 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7463372 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7463373 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7463374 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7463375 except in three cases that of their wives their daughters and their girlfriends
7463376 nancy unwilling to stand up for womens pro choice beliefs
7463377 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7463378 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7463379 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7463380 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7463381 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7463382 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7463383 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7463384 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7463385 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7463386 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7463387 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7463388 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7463389 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7463390 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7463391 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7463392 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7463393 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7463394 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7463395 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7463396 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7463397 even at the same location the temperature near the ground may be very different from the temperature 5 feet 1 52m above the ground and different again from 10 feet or 50 feet above the ground
7463398 particularly in the presence of vegetation say in a rainforest the temperature above the vegetation may be very different from the temperature below the top of the vegetation
7463399 a reasonable suggestion might be to use the average temperature of the first 50 feet of air either above ground or above the top of the vegetation to measure sat surface air temperature we have to agree on what it is and as far as i know no such standard has been suggested or generally adopted
7463400 its videos such as this when i am reminded why we are fighting notice how ron doesnt even flinch when asked some of
7463401 it is only a matter of time before wolves spread all across northern germany in their move ever westward
7463402 aside from two large cities berlin and hamburg the region is sparsely settled there are vast areas of woodlands lakes and dark forests
7463403 this is the region where we shall see whether the wolf spreads further westward and if so in what numbers
7463404 weasels and otters and raccoons are already well re establishing themselves
7463405 and the european moose elk is poised to move westward indeed elk are already relatively common in the czech republic
7463406 wolves are certainly welcome here as they enrich the local wildlife assortment
7463407 of course if they become a pest hunters will have to go after them to keep their population number in check as we do with red foxes
7463408 they decimate not only mice but also other small mammals and snakes and other egg thieves
7463409 we actually get appeals from residents to kill more foxes because they are eliminating too many predators in some nature wildlife preserves
7463410 the main problem will be the clich of the big bad wolf in the minds of many people
7463411 wolves can of course be dangerous to humans in certain situations generally when they are backed into a corner but they are generally no threat to humans
7463412 europeans generally are very mindful of the dire effects that humans have had on the environment over the centuries and they are for the most part happy to see the return of bears and wolves and other creatures after near extinction of those species
7463413 as more predators move in the balance of nature returns to normal and we see a reduction in rats and mice and rabbits
7463414 those small creatures form the diet of predators such as the german sea eagle which was the emblem of germany for centuries but which was driven to the verge of extinction by unthinking hunters
7463415 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7463416 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system

7463418 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7463419 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7463420 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7463421 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7463422 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7463423 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7463424 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
7463425 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7463426 with its rich culture great beach resorts and reputation as a value for money destination is bound to be a winner

7463431 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
7463432 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7463433 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
7463434 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7463435 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7463436 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7463437 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7463438 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7463439 i dont know if you are aware that i am a decorated vietnam war veteran
7463440 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7463441 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7463442 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7463443 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7463444 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7463445 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7463446 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7463447 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7463448 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7463449 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7463450 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7463451 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7463452 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7463453 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7463454 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7463455 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7463456 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7463457 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7463458 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7463459 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7463460 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years

7463462 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon

7463465 the bill permits the board of game to allow a predator program for wolves and grizzly bears if the commissioner of fish and game finds an emergency where wolves or grizzly bears in an area are causing a decline in prey

7463468 first the wolf pack finds the weakest easiest target in the herd usually the young aged or injured
7463469 wolves have already been reintroduced to yellowstone the fact that people will eventually die as a result is seen as irrelevant by the groups responsible
7463470 terminating these animals means keeping the numbers of wildlife herds at a level we can hunt and eat for years to come
7463471 and we all know where that money will come from the pockets of hunters trappers and fishermen
7463472 what lost said was 12 01 am we should all run after our meat and rip its throat out with our teeth to kill it
7463473 we should all run after our meat and rip its throat out with our teeth to kill it
7463474 if any of you are capable of killing whatever youre hunting this year in the same manner as a wolf then you might have some real prowess
7463475 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7463476 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7463477 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7463478 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7463479 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7463480 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7463481 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7463482 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7463483 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7463484 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7463485 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7463486 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap

7463494 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7463495 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7463496 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7463497 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7463498 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7463499 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7463500 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7463501 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7463502 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7463503 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7463504 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7463505 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7463506 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7463507 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7463508 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7463509 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7463510 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7463511 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7463512 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7463513 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7463514 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7463515 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7463516 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7463517 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states

7463524 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7463525 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7463526 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7463527 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7463528 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7463529 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7463530 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare

7463540 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7463541 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7463542 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions

7463547 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian state
7463548 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7463549 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7463550 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7463551 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7463552 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7463553 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us

7463555 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7463556 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7463557 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells

7463560 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7463561 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7463562 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7463563 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7463564 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7463565 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7463566 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7463567 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7463568 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7463569 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7463570 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be

7463583 we will encourage voters to look beyond the glamour of barack obamas celebrity status to his inexperience and lack of accomplishment
7463584 even democrats in ohio are calling on senator obama to offer something more than a lofty speech ohioans are beginning to wonder if theres anything more to barack obama than his trusty teleprompter
7463585 hiding out in one of your seven houses while your surrogates launch more low road attacks is not a surprising strategy for john mccain
7463586 but given his shocking disconnect with the struggles of american families john mccain would be better served using this time to rewrite his economic plan that was authored by an adviser who thinks we are a nation of whiners and which offers nothing more than the same failed bush economic policies of the last eight years

7463592 vejo atr s de n s pa ses que desportivamente todos pensavam que estariam muito longe na escala de desenvolvimento mundial acho que a nossa posi o corresponde talvez estejamos at um pouco acima
7463593 ao contr rio da espanha em barcelona1992 que fez um investimento sustentado eles fizeram uma aposta desportiva apenas para os jogos atenas2004
7463594 devemos recordar que o ndice de pr tica desportiva em portugal muito mau um grande objectivo do governo aumentar este ndice
7463595 n o ter atingido o proposto em termos de medalhas e objectivos quatro p dios e 60 pontos
7463596 os objectivos tra ados foram realistas pod amos ter posto a fasquia mais baixa e facilmente a pass vamos o que era poss vel e realista se tiv ssemos como objectivos duas medalhas e 30 pontos est vamos todos felizes porque os t nhamos atingido mas isso era irmos pela mediocridade
7463597 n o vejo nenhum fosso entre a possibilidade de ganhar medalhas e alguns atletas que estiveram muito pr ximo disso como na vela prezo muito os atletas que est o aqui s o da elite mundial por exemplo o diogo ganchinho 11 nos trampolins e o pedro p voa 7 no taekwondo representam modalidades em que s c estiveram os melhores do mundo

7463613 the nomination of the first african american presidential nominee after a bitter primary campaign and his efforts to unite a party afterward were simply more newsworthy than a candidate whose nomination was already assured and who spent much of that time raising money
7463614 numbers arent everything in political coverage but readers deserve comparable coverage of the candidates
7463615 bolt hat der leichtathletik auf jeden fall sehr gut getan das empfinden vor allem die sponsoren so
7463616 mit den leistungen ist die leichtathletik von den weltweiten botschaften an die spitze ger ckt
7463617 i write absurdist humour stuff and im involved in the scene my writing has gone through a drastic change recently so ill describe it in two phases
7463618 phase 1 i used to write an everything but the kitchen sink style of surrealist fantasy the gags and word play and absurd situations took precedence over the plot which i mostly used to maintain the readers attention i think a reader needs to be very attentive to appreciate this kind of writing i burned away hundreds of ideas per page anything could happen the settings werent governed by reality i wanted the reader to be able to pick any random sentence in the book and be amused by it even if they didnt know its context i think it is almost impossible to do this without weakening the plot development it came from below the belt
7463619 ive written about three more books like this but they havent been published yet
7463620 phase 2 im now focusing more on plot and character development
7463621 that i wrote this way its about a city wide demolition derby between moving buildings winner gets a monopoly over the entire fast food industry
7463622 its a sort of retelling of the king arthur myth with a dorky fake anarchist teenager playing the role of king arthur a tv remote control playing the role of excalibur and the land of television playing the role of arthurs realm
7463623 not really i dont think i wasted them because its easy for me to come up with ideas although its difficult to come up with hundreds of ideas per page i dont feel like i ration ideas but its much easier for me now that i dont work this way anymore
7463624 i used to get it a lot during phase one because of the whole thing about coming up with new ideas in every sentence i dont get it very much anymore its because i write outlines i didnt used to sometimes i get stuck while im working on the outline but that doesnt last as long as when i got stuck during phase one it would often take me an hour to compose a sentence
7463625 soon after that i spent a lot of afternoons in my fathers office where i used his computer to write a neverending story about my friends and i searching for a treasure in a haunted house we didnt have a computer at home i think that ended up being a couple of hundred pages long before i lost interest
7463626 i try to sit down and get it done but i often procrastinate while im sitting at my computer i dont wait for inspiration except for when im between projects i dont just start typing away before i know what im getting myself into
7463627 i dont have any rituals i wish i had a separate writing room because my bedroom makes me lazy but i cant afford that luxury im very reliant on word processors but im trying to become more comfortable with using notebooks
7463628 once i a bought a very expensive pen before starting a new novel but it didnt really help
7463629 coffee used to be one thing that i relied on to get myself where i needed to be mentally but i cant drink it anymore i now have this disorder where caffeine causes me to clench my jaw when im sleeping and wake up with extreme head pain
7463630 i havent written in any strange locations or situations my writing experiences have been very mundane so instead ill tell you the strangest location where ive had sex up a tree
7463631 i like a few of the early weird fiction writers especially robert w chambers and lovecraft i have to be in a certain kind of mood to enjoy lovecraft though or else his work seems very overwritten
7463632 yeah hypergraphia a condition that gives you an overwhelming urge to write not sure if i have it because the people who do are very prolific and i am a little slow but i do feel an overwhelming urge to write after finishing a major project i get a sense of fulfillment that lasts for a day or so then the compulsion starts all over again i feel like im sisyphus but i can cheat between projects and bring myself to a state of near satisfaction by blogging and doing writing exercises
7463633 the second one is kind of phase two ish but not really
7463634 which have since been rewritten because the plot changed ignore the intros excerpt two
7463635 yeah but the main building is an office building that doesnt have anything to do with fast food the protagonist works there and a position that he wants has just opened up so he thinks that winning the derby will get him the promotion because his boss likes fast food so hes driving the building and trying not to get caught he doesnt want his co workers or boss to know that their building is being used in the competion until he wins it his antagonist is driving an apartment building that he hijacked to enter into the derby illegally he wants to destroy mcdonalds all the other buildings have to do with fast food theres a third protagonist who works at a mcdonalds franchise
7463636 all my sentences needed to be like that during phase one
7463637 right now i find myself rewriting sentences because they seem out of character
7463638 i liked it when people write similar to me during phase one because it takes a hell of a lot of time and effort to do well i also like it when there are no similarities between our writing
7463639 i like stories that are fun to read a playful use of language i have a preference for unreal stories but it doesnt always have to be like that
7463640 i feel like theres two main templates for writing styles and i dont like either of them literary fiction and genre fiction and the majority of the stories that i receive in those two genres feel like theyre written by the same two people
7463641 the genre writers style is loose but not loose like stream of consciousness writing they dont focus on the writing style the style is dull and mundane all their focus goes to the plot they are on the toilet they have diarrhea
7463642 i think i prefer the literary fiction writer to the genre writer i groan whenever i see a genre fiction submission but bust is more genre than literary although i dont think id classify us as lying somewhere between the two were off the map
7463643 i like it when literary and genre fiction writers escape from their boxes but if they escape i guess they arent literary and genre fiction writers anymore
7463644 oh and my tastes have gone away from the morbid recently i dont want to read publish stories that make me depressed i like light and fluffy and black humor beats everything
7463645 mike is good i like mike i published a great short of his in the last issue
7463646 mo ali a lot even though i havent read anything new from him in a long time i think you are familiar with his work
7463647 sam pink is like russell edson with much bigger balls and a tendency to aim at the throat rather than the spleen
7463648 blake butler also has a story in the next issue of
7463649 the next issue of bust down the door and eat all the chickens should be out next month sept 08 heres a list of contributors sam pink cameron pierce matthew simmons darby larson aaron sitze and adam breckenridge

7463659 jeg beundrer deg ulf for den veien du g r n r du ser behov for fellesskap ikke minst med de store kirkene den katolske og den ortodokse

7463661 dersom du med din munn bekjenner at jesus er herre og i ditt hjerte tror at gud oppvakte han fra de d de skal du bli frelst
7463662 om jesus ikke hadde oppst tt da var vi fortsatt i v re synder
7463663 jeg krenker deg i tanker ord og gjerning jeg kjenner den ondes lyst i mitt hjerte
7463664 gud har ut st sin kj rlighet i v rt hjerte

7463666 dere er hans verk ved kristus jesus han som er blitt v r visdom fra gud v r rettferdighet helliggj relse og forl sning

7463674 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7463675 first of all nothing is being given in return for the prisoners secondly there is a deviation from the accepted standards that no prisoner will be released before having served two thirds of his sentence and that no prisoner will be released who has killed israelis there is an aggregate of new facts that we did not have before
7463676 you will try to explain the reasoning behind this so that we will understand
7463677 there is very little time left for serious judicial review
7463678 what can one examine from one day to the next this is wrong
7463679 all we hear are legal formulae which are correct as far as they go but not magic
7463680 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7463681 he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7463682 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7463683 nieuwsconsumenten die beroep doen op meerdere mediakanalen gaan tijdens de dag vaker op zoek naar nieuws

7463685 i always look forward to these games and we have a tremendous record against united at fratton park
7463686 last season we did not lose at home to any of the big four the key is to match their work rate
7463687 sure it looks a really big test for us now but i think we are still a very good team at home and we will take some beating united wont relish coming here they never do
7463688 it might work to my advantage that so many players are out of the team
7463689 we have a lot of players out just now and when we are short of numbers you need to take your opportunities
7463690 there is so much quality in the squad we all know if you do not perform the manager will have you straight out of the team
7463691 but as we have seen plenty of times before the manager will stick by you if you do the job he needs
7463692 actually by this time next year we will be opening bradshaw elementary as planned and then the high school will come along probably in the spring of 2010
7463693 what we will look like next week is anyones guess
7463694 but we had one school last fall where the numbers were up and that was welch elementary so we will watch that and see what happens
7463695 we are moving along with the states 21st century initiative
7463696 and of course the state is talking about new content standards and objectives and we are moving toward as much integration in the classroom as we can so kids will see that depending upon where they are sporadically or quite a bit
7463697 its nice to be some place where you feel like your welcome
7463698 i really feel that this is a good way for the students to get to learn more about the community and the community to learn more about the students
7463699 this is the fourth welcome home college town social we have held
7463700 when we started this we wanted to have an event that would introduce the students to the downtown business community it was a success the first year and we wanted to work to make it better each year
7463701 we started meeting in april to plan for this event
7463702 we try to learn more each year so we can improve it as we go along we have about 12 members on the committee but we have a core group of six to eight committee members who take the input and make it work
7463703 last year it started at 2 p m and many of the students had left by the dinner hour
7463704 i just thought it would be a little better if they started the social a little closer to the time they started serving food
7463705 i think this is a good way for the college students and people in town to get to know each other
7463706 the people have been so nice it really makes you feel welcome
7463707 it provides a comfortable setting for the town and the students to enjoy an evening together
7463708 administrators have been encouraged to help their students and faculties develop some school wide initiatives for reducing reusing and or recycling
7463709 theyll be getting their forms on the administrative website and memos will be e mailed instead of using inner office mail or faxes
7463710 man kann einen menschen nichts lehren man kann ihm nur helfen es in sich selbst zu entdecken
7463711 i encourage all those who provide products and services to the coal industry in the greater bluefield area to attend the events both during the day and in the evening to show their support for the industry
7463712 were going to turn that around and make the water our friend
7463713 were able to do this project because we have some available funds and we have the space available
7463714 fema removed the three buildings one was the old dollar store but all had been vacant since the flood
7463715 who knows if the good weather weve had lately holds out the project may be done sooner than that
7463716 were learning more all the time and each day we get better at what we do we have a dress code business casual but that doesnt seem to scare people off but its our food that keeps people coming back our chef richard streeter has some special dishes that he makes that well you just have to try them to find out how good they are
7463717 hopefully new people will see what were doing here and want to take part in it
7463718 we see all of this as a once in a lifetime opportunity to really make a difference here this is not the work of one person our entire council has given its unanimous support of these projects that will help our city

7463734 da die z hne im ober und unterkiefer nicht mehr richtig aufeinanderpassen schmirgeln sich die patienten die st renden zahnbuckel nachts zumeist unbewusst selber ab

7463737 der u ere druck wird also in momenten die sich nicht bewusst kontrollieren lassen in einen k rperlichen druck umgewandelt der sich im knirschen entl dt

7463741 selbst f r spezialisten ist der erfolg bringende therapieansatz nicht immer gleich eindeutig absehbar
7463742 wenn die ursache der schmerzen sich nicht eindeutig ermitteln l sst sollte die therapie immer an dem betroffenen k rperteil ansetzen das am besten zu erreichen ist

7463746 everything you say is looked at and in many cases misconstrued
7463747 theres a reason why people like her its because she doesnt sort of you know fuel the fire
7463748 i wake up every morning wondering how on the earth im going to pull off that next minor miracle to get through the day
7463749 with the exception of the campaign trail and life in the public eye i have to say that my life now is really not that much different from many of yours

7463755 were going up against a tough comparison because the third quarter of 2007 hadnt really seen the full brunt of the credit crunch we were still flying high on capital markets earnings and things like that
7463756 several economic indicators suggest that growth rates in lending activity for the canadian banks will moderate while real estate prices may decline during a period of rising unemployment
7463757 i dont think its going to be as bad as a lot of people are calling for
7463758 im not as bearish as everybody else having said that i dont think the stock should rally on it who cares if youve got a bad outlook youve got a bad outlook
7463759 we expect that both the numbers of suspected cases and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues and samples continue to be received from provincial territorial and federal partners
7463760 going through the crisis there are two advisers ive paid no attention to
7463761 the first are the lawyers and the second are the accountants its not about the money or the legal liability this is about our being accountable for providing consumers with safe food
7463762 its highly likely that the hospital meat was related to the death
7463763 a whole bunch of ministers at the top a whole bunch of soldiers at the bottom and nothing in between
7463764 local government is where the actual governance is its more realistic its more sustainable and its more secure
7463765 ideally bottom up is very good for somalia but the problem is the warlords to make any government work they have to be included in some way
7463766 these vessels are a key priority of the government of canada
7463767 however the government must ensure that canadian taxpayers receive the best value for their money
7463768 if the protecteur and preserver are going to be needed longer than expected we will also determine what needs to be done to keep our supply ships safe operational and available until they can be replaced
7463769 many of their systems are nearly obsolete such as the boilers they use to generate steam for main propulsion as you might expect its becoming increasingly difficult and costly to maintain these ships spare parts are no longer readily available and the skills needed to operate and maintain systems that were already mature in the 1960s are becoming increasingly rare

7463773 tiger got to hunt bird got to fly man got to sit and wonder why why why tiger got to sleep bird got to land man got to tell himself he understand
7463774 good old adam so devastated so crushed but gives an interview
7463775 actually tells the interviewer he is sorry and i believe he really was
7463776 we canadians all say sorry the minute we get on an elevator just because we push the button for our floor were sorry for having to reach push a button exist on a floor different from the others on the elevator even an ass like me says sorry
7463777 but aside from being sorry he is honest and at the same time respectful says he just cant believe what happened his worst race in six years then says he just didnt have it in the race finished by saying what a time not to have it i was really really proud of him
7463778 i thought about what a superb lesson he was teaching in a way that has almost nothing to do with sports if you know what i mean what a great teacher he is for my kids who are just starting to play sports and just starting out in life
7463779 he is the last guy in the world who wanted to lose or be a symbol for how to behave when you lose or be a metaphor for lessons about losing juxtaposed to winning or just plain losing itself
7463780 we all lose so much and that is from a privileged guy like me nice family to grow up with friends good job
7463781 but aside from how he behaved and again i am sorry to use him like this we all lose a girlfriend a boyfriend a friend a job opportunity lose a loved one
7463782 i am not advocating the modern man whine that i hate so much but its just that in the great balance sheet that goes with trying let alone at his level he was so honourable
7463783 that is who he is the definition of honourable a title in our country that goes with cabinet members and judges you have seen a lot of judges
7463784 and if you go on the election trail will see a lot of politicians and there are good and bad in both groups some very good ones who really are in it for the public service guess thats the idea behind giving them that handle
7463785 but when you look at this young man how he behaved the enormous credit he brought to himself his family and his country he is worthy of our honour as the oxford english dictionary sets out
7463786 here we are trapped in the amber of the moment there is no why
7463787 today is one of the greatest days in all our history
7463788 what is ideal and what is real are two different things
7463789 i truly believed that they could co exist and as the season progressed i came to believe that they couldnt
7463790 when he finally got to be a starter last year after waiting around for so many years that was something that was near and dear to him
7463791 so to be fair to him thats kind of how the decision got made
7463792 i think we did really well by bishop by getting him into a situation where he can realize his potential and his dreams
7463793 during the first four months diesel demand has grown at 18 percent
7463794 i also sold a bronze sculpture politician by krishna murari to a collector in gurgaon for rs 150 000 i thought the canvases and the textile art would go first but i am so glad that the sculptures have been sold
7463795 vermas untitled work a steel and iron cast installation showing the impact of mega industries on rural lifestyles in bastar has been booked several times over
7463796 i never thought i would be able to show my work in india
7463797 i have had bookings for almost everything from a wide cross section of people including a senior politician who is also an art collector
7463798 as art is becoming more collector based awareness about sculptures is growing indian taste for sculptures is changing from the old british concept of decorative sculptures to contemporary installation art and solid figures
7463799 chicken jalfrezi is my favourite but i like to have something different each time
7463800 ill try to have as many main dishes as i can but there will be some places where ill just order poppadoms and things like onion bhajis and aloo saag because ill be too stuffed
7463801 chicken jalfrezi is my favourite but i like to have something different each time
7463802 ill try to have as many main dishes as i can but there will be some places where ill just order poppadoms and things like onion bhajis and aloo saag because ill be too stuffed
7463803 centres of excellence really continued after advertisement below means these are the services they didnt take away
7463804 orthopedics ear nose and throat and plastic surgery will still be done in st catharines as well as gngh and since only they can operate on children they will become the centre of excellence
7463805 the number of family doctors seeing patients in hospital will continue to diminish we cant drive all over the peninsula every morning to do rounds on our inpatients

7463817 we are falling behind other states in terms of the money allocated to venture capital and startups
7463818 we want to make sure legislators and members of the general assembly understand what venture capital is this is money we are going to invest anyway and we are using it in a manner to spur economic growth
7463819 i dont think we should be making brand new accounts for technology investments
7463820 the treasurer already has a technology account and we have to have better information about the success of that before we get into a whole new venture
7463821 some of the problems have less to do with the pure merits of the legislation than the current structural problems the state is having

7463865 its called delivering creative future but it doesnt feel like there is a central creative vision
7463866 my main worry and the main challenge for the bbc will be the consolidation of the news division this will take some skilful management to say the least
7463867 make the place simpler to tear down the walls between creative people
7463868 this is a passionate organisation and people care passionately about their own creative endeavours
7463869 but people need to step back to see the big picture
7463870 this is a massive step forward in achieving our vision of a renewed caledonian forest it is a huge milestone for us and we look forward to restoring dundreggan into a wild landscape that the uk and scotland can be proud of
7463871 we want to thank our members supporters and funding partners including the tubney trust who helped raise the money for the purchase it would not have been possible without them we look forward to working with neighbouring landowners and the local community to bring real environmental benefits to the area
7463872 this is just the beginning of an important and thrilling project helping accelerate the return of native species and trees to the landscape where they belong enriching the countryside and the lives of us all for generations to come what great news
7463873 its wonderful news that dundreggan is now owned by trees for life and can be returned to its former forest glory this is a tremendous breakthrough for the restoration of scotlands great caledonian forest

7463877 we hebben een paar vierde plaatsen behaald die op zich zeer mooi zijn maar ook wat pijn doen het bilan voor belgi is niet zo goed als we gewenst hadden maar toch chapeau voor de dames nu moeten we rustig nadenken over hoe we beter kunnen worden we hebben twee medailles behaald ooit moeten we er tussen de tien en de vijftien kunnen bemachtigen
7463878 het zal gtst zeker ten goede komen luiden de eerste reacties
7463879 in remote harsh country like that people have to work together to pitch in to help each other out ive held that belief all of my life
7463880 one of our directors said oh have you ever been to in amp out and he was like never but why dont you call my office and well go out and ill drive too so i like that kind of relationship that hes willing to bring
7463881 i liked his approach of getting to know us of not coming and telling us what to do and who to be but rather coming in and finding out who we are and trying to build on our strengths
7463882 we suggest that public health campaigns will be more successful if they attend to how behaviors act as markers or signals of identity
7463883 decisions are not only based on risks and benefits but also the identity that a given choice communicates to others consequently shifting perceptions of the identity associated with a risky behavior can help make better health a reality
7463884 shifting signals to help health using identity signaling to reduce risky health behaviors
7463885 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans
7463886 the uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket contrary to popular myth they are not all free riders
7463887 when a triggering agent such as a volatile anesthetic is introduced into an mh susceptible persons body increased temperature and muscle rigidity can occur leading to muscle damage and release of ions and proteins into the blood
7463888 this can result in the death of the patient due to an irregular heart beat or kidney failure after the surgical procedure
7463889 proving the causative role of a new mutation enables researchers to include it in the list of mh mutations and makes the genetic test more reliable
7463890 this is an important step toward establishing an inexpensive and minimally invasive genetic test for diagnosing mh this new mutation should therefore be included in the current list of mh causing mutations
7463891 the research findings suggest that viewers donated because they felt an obligation to do so people expect self or social censure if they dont help when they feel empathy for a person or organization they care about
7463892 failing to help under these conditions often leads to shame which is a powerful negative emotion that is experienced when there is an inconsistency between a persons actual and desired self
7463893 paradoxically it is by helping others that we derive self benefits in the form of enhanced self esteem and social approval serving others connotes valued human traits including compassion cooperativeness and kindness
7463894 an empathy helping perspective on consumers responses to fundraising appeals
7463895 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals
7463896 given the growing obesity epidemic we felt that examining vigabatrins therapeutic efficacy for obesity was particularly relevant
7463897 offers hope that this drug could potentially treat severe obesity
7463898 this would appear to be true even if the obesity results from binge eating as this disorder is characterized by eating patterns that are similar to drug taking patterns in those with cocaine dependency
7463899 subchronic racemic gamma vinyl gaba produces weight loss in sprague dawley and zucker fatty rats
7463900 the incident that triggered this intervention is a real tragedy it follows that the trust should continue to do everything possible to ensure it does not happen again
7463901 we are satisfied that lessons have been learned and the trust is addressing the main concerns by making changes to its systems to reduce the risk of an incident like this being repeated
7463902 it may be too early to see the full impact of some of the improvements that have been made but the trust must maintain pressure to further drive down their response times
7463903 the sympathy inherent to a close relationship with a victim extends to other victims leading benefactors to prefer charities that help those suffering from the misfortunes that have affected their friends and loved ones
7463904 so friendship with a victim does not simply make people more sympathetic rather it directs their sympathy to others with the same misfortune as their friend or loved one
7463905 if as our results show a relationship created in the lab in a few minutes can significantly increase giving then surely a charity can inspire a connection between a victim and a benefactor through its solicitations
7463906 we have known for some time that young and middle aged adults who are overweight run a higher risk of death and it was presumed that this held true for older people in fact our results show that the risk of dying is higher only for the most severely obese but that all older people who are overweight are at significantly increased risk of developing problems with mobility and carrying out everyday tasks
7463907 this research is important because a growing proportion of the population is aged 65 or over and more and more of these older people are overweight in fact in most developed countries middle aged and elderly adults are more likely to be obese than people in any other age group these findings have huge significance for the delivery of health care both now and in the future increasing numbers of older people and higher levels of overweight and obesity will lead to a greater burden of disability and ill health and place an immense strain on health and social services the issue is likely to get worse as time goes on and represents a ticking time bomb for health services around the world
7463908 staying a healthy weight can be a fun and relatively easy thing to do even as people get older
7463909 our experience of running supported walking and cycling groups has shown that older people benefit in many ways from regular physical activity
7463910 people are living longer but this study shows that excess weight can have a real impact on the quality of peoples lives which can reduce the benefit of those extra years we must do all we can to encourage older friends or relatives to build enjoyable exercise into their daily routine and develop good habits ourselves to take into our retirement years people can visit http www strollbacktheyears info or http www healthpromcornwall org 01209 313419 for more advice

7463913 any choice you make for vice president has pros and cons and thats true for both
7463914 it seems to me that the republican party is not as far as i can tell a one issue party abortion rights would just be one issue among many that would have to be evaluated
7463915 our main criteria is knowing we could sleep at night knowing they could be president of the united states
7463916 select the best person whos able to do that and if that person happens to be pro choice the party will support that
7463917 it seemed destined to add fuel to the fight already smoldering over abortion rights
7463918 will nominate a person to be vice president who shares his principles values and priorities

7463924 obamas stadium address on thursday the 45th anniversary of rev martin luther king jr s i have a dream speech will result in effusive and overwhelming press coverage this coverage will be impenetrable and will undoubtedly impact the polls
7463925 the one returns this time to lead us to the road to denver
7463926 we will encourage voters to look beyond the glamour of barack obamas celebrity status to his inexperience and lack of accomplishment
7463927 even democrats in ohio are calling on senator obama to offer something more than a lofty speech ohioans are beginning to wonder if theres anything more to barack obama than his trusty teleprompter
7463928 hiding out in one of your seven houses while your surrogates launch more low road attacks is not a surprising strategy for john mccain
7463929 but given his shocking disconnect with the struggles of american families john mccain would be better served using this time to rewrite his economic plan that was authored by an adviser who thinks we are a nation of whiners and which offers nothing more than the same failed bush economic policies of the last eight years

7463962 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a qualifier
7463963 i know people expect us to get through but its not as if were playing a mickey mouse team
7463964 the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages
7463965 we had a tough match against anderlecht a few years ago so im not surprised liege caused us problems
7463966 they caught us a bit cold in the first leg their manager said we were sleeping but they deserve credit for the way they played
7463967 they were spot on tactically hitting us on the counter attack and trying to make us play like a home side you have to remember theyd gone something like 30 games unbeaten in their own league and they are a club with european pedigree
7463968 we didnt play well and we know well have to improve at anfield everyone knows how important it is for our season to get into the group stage
7463969 its always a funny time for us to have such a massive game before weve got going in the season some of our results have reflected that
7463970 we lost at home to ak graz in the year we won the competition and had a narrow win in the last minute against maccabi haifa two years ago so anyone thinking well win comfortably knows thats very dangerous
7463971 you have to bear in mind this is probably the biggest game of the season already and in some cases it may be the most important match theyve ever had in their career
7463972 that makes them very tough opponents so we will have to be on our guard any side which can keep fernando torres and robbie keane as quiet as they did in the first leg has quality we didnt have any chances in the game
7463973 it would be unthinkable for us not to be in the champions league you just want to get this qualifier out the way put europe on the back burner for a while and get focused for a couple of months on doing well in the league
7463974 as players we expect to be there and so do the fans we know in this situation all the pressure is on us but we dont want to get negative about that
7463975 all the hard work finishing in the top four last season was geared towards reaching the group stages so theres no way we want to let that slip

7463992 if the u s dollar is rising commodities take a hit its been a huge factor
7463993 we may see this rally in the u s dollar continue in the short term but you have to differentiate between speculation and the underlying demand for commodities

7464031 unfortunate events took place the first time that a jury was empanelled to try the accused mr wood
7464032 i had to discharge the jury because some jurors disobeyed my instructions and misconducted themselves
7464033 at some considerable public expense and inconvenience to a lot of people i had to stop the trial
7464034 its possible that every member of this jury panel will have heard about read about or seen some report or comment about this case over the past few years
7464035 the court is anxious to ensure that every juror who tries this case can be completely impartial
7464036 you are absolutely forbidden to make your own inquiries about this trial
7464037 ac estamos f jense lo bien que administramos ahora los aviones y la empresa
7464038 thank you for our wonderful stay the gite is beautiful see you next year
7464039 we thoroughly enjoyed our stay this was our first visit to the area we will be back thankyou
7464040 weve shown what we intend to do this season over the two weeks home and away thats how we will play
7464041 the players can only improve because of their age we have great belief in them and they have to take that on board however disappointed they are now they should take a lot out of it
7464042 the top four has to be the long term aim for us
7464043 theres a lot of improvement to make but i think the players could surprise themselves this year if they keep that level of performance
7464044 the disappointing thing is that our performances against tottenham and liverpool merited six to four points not three like we have
7464045 we need to move on and pick ourselves up for the cup game its not hard but physically it might be hard it was demanding at liverpool and we worked hard
7464046 im desperate to have a good cup run whether that is in the carling cup or fa cup i dont care but we want to get into europe and the cups are the best way
7464047 we had a real belief that we could win and for 85 minutes we thought we would do that
7464048 even when it went to 1 1 we didnt think we would lose and we almost went ahead again
7464049 but we are looking good and we have to make sure this defeat doesnt turn out to be a major set back
7464050 its hard to sum up because we were so disappointed i dont even know what we can do about the end because we defended very well they got a fluke equaliser and that raised everyone
7464051 you cannot blame the lads at all to lose in the 94th minute is disappointing for everyone insisted danny wilson
7464052 throughout the game we played well and their goalkeeper was inspired at times
7464053 he had a fantastic game we pushed and pushed and in the end a decision cost us two or three players sold themselves a little bit and the boy cracked it
7464054 we showed great endeavor great enthusiasm and in the end we fell short
7464055 they snatched it and the way they played meant it was going to be tight for us and they had 11 men behind the ball every time we attacked
7464056 its disappointing i have to say a terrific performance again great endeavour and enthusiasm but we couldnt get that goal added wilson
7464057 the way stockport came it was always going to be a patient game for us
7464058 we thought they would put 11 men behind the ball which made it very very difficult but we still created the chances
7464059 its just a sucker punch right at the end thats the sad thing about it
7464060 its a hard lesson to learn but sometimes youve got to learn them
7464061 you need patience but there was no worries about our attacking play we got into great areas at times
7464062 i have to say he fon williams played outstandingly well but i think overall we cant be too disappointed again
7464063 there are babies whove been born and are now walking and talking since we started this campaign
7464064 it has been a long pull all of us wish it would be shorter
7464065 obama has picked someone who is going to be very aggressive in going after mccain and who is not going to be recalcitrant about it
7464066 if i was mccain id be thinking about my own attack dog
7464067 hes going to want someone who can go toe to toe with biden
7464068 certainly biden was a big choice for obama and it does therefore force mccain to think about a big choice both in terms of debates and the potential demographic or state by state advantages in who he picks for his running mate

7464074 there is no intention to question or qualify that principle in any way i am surprised that any doubt should at all have arisen about this
7464075 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7464076 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7464077 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7464078 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7464079 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7464080 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7464081 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7464082 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7464083 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7464084 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7464085 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7464086 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7464087 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7464088 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7464089 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7464090 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7464091 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7464092 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7464093 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7464094 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7464095 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7464096 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7464097 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7464098 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7464099 this is a day of joy for the fighters of freedom and independence
7464100 it is like a wedding celebration for the palestinian people but our joy will not be complete until all palestinian prisoners are released
7464101 this is a big day we have been awaiting for 32 years
7464102 it is a gesture towards the palestinian leadership to strengthen moderate and pragmatic forces
7464103 it is not easy to release prisoners and particularly those who have been involved in murderous terrorist attacks
7464104 rather than by the christian memory and heritage of the vast majority of member states
7464105 generally positive towards the european project and its founding ideals
7464106 as the recent referendum on the lisbon treaty in ireland suggests at least some of those who were previously enthusiastic about the founding aims of the eu both social and economic are now expressing unease
7464107 a fairly widespread culture in european affairs which relegates manifestations of ones own religious convictions to the private and subjective sphere
7464108 this trend within the eu and its impact on people of faith has inevitable political and social consequences not least on levels of support for the project itself
7464109 why it may be important for the eu to look again at a prevailing pragmatic attitude that compromises on essential human moral and social values on the basis of the lowest common denominator
7464110 the experience of many christians within the eu is that this lowest common denominator invariably coincides with the secular and relativist tradition within europe that which denies moral absolutes with an objective basis rather than the religious view
7464111 being denied the right to intervene in public debates or at least having their contribution dismissed as an attempt to protect unjustified privileges such as for example the right to employ people who support the ethos of a christian institution
7464112 successive decisions which have undermined the family based on marriage the right to life from the moment of conception to natural death the sacredness of the sabbath the right of christian institutions to maintain and promote their ethos including schools these and other decisions have made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive commitment to the european project
7464113 a culture which prides itself on the separation of church and state and on its diversity
7464114 intrigued to discover last weekend that it was quite natural to expect the us presidential candidates to answer direct questions about their commitment to faith their willingness to support faith based organisations their position on moral issues and how it would affect their appointment of public officials
7464115 to the day we have the same level of openness and choice in our own elections here in ireland and in europe
7464116 without respect for its christian memory and soul i believe it is possible to anticipate continuing difficulties for the european project these will emerge not only in economic terms but in terms of social cohesion and the continued growth of a dangerous individualism that does not care about god or about what the future might have in store
7464117 detectives are treating the incident as an abduction and are liaising closely with an garda siochana as there is a possibility that bailey may be in the south of ireland
7464118 these lads have taken a lot of punishment from kerry over the last number of years counihan said shortly after the full time whistle on sunday
7464119 there were times out there when they were on top of us that we could have folded up the tent and capitulated again but we display tremendous character in not throwing in the towel and that has to count for something
7464120 once we have that in the tank there is always a possibility of winning and that keeps players going
7464121 the reality of the situation from my point of view is that some of our players under performed again out there today and its something well have to address before the replay we have room for improvement and the players will know that themselves
7464122 i have to admit that we were fortunate enough to get the draw we didnt play well on the day i recall saying to the selectors when we were six points down and two minutes left to play that we needed two goals if were to extricate ourselves out of this game
7464123 listening to the liverpool match against middlesbrough on saturday id be a bit of a fan they needed two goals if they were to win the game late and they got them
7464124 i remember saying to one of the lads that that is a sign of a team that is mentally strong the team that gets one goal back rises a bit while the opposition becomes a bit rattled
7464125 similarly thats what happened here james got a goal and then we pushed on looking for another and that came from a penalty so as long as there is time left there is hope armagh fan 25 august 2008 08 52
7464126 very interesting development from the point of view of our project
7464127 a point that needs making is that judge harvey is no mug when it comes to the internet he has written a text book on cyber law in new zealand
7464128 on a technical level he probably knows more about the internet than any other judge in the country
7464129 it may sound odd but the humanity of the taliban because they are a wide very diverse group of people
7464130 some would like to talk to the british government some of them dont want to be fighting british troops some of them would this is the ideological taliban
7464131 you knew the bombs were dropping and the guns were pointing in that direction but you never got a sense of how afghans are as a people
7464132 comments like this can only add hugely to the grief of relatives of the fallen
7464133 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7464134 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7464135 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7464136 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7464137 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7464138 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7464139 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7464140 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7464141 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7464142 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7464143 we will fight for self determination for the region it is no longer a matter of land for the amarnath cave shrine
7464144 the agitation will gather momentum and people will take to the streets in large numbers whenever the curfew is lifted
7464145 wenn der ball normal aufgesprungen w re h tte ich ihn gehalten
7464146 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7464147 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7464148 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7464149 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7464150 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7464151 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7464152 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7464153 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7464154 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7464155 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7464156 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7464157 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7464158 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7464159 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7464160 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7464161 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7464162 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7464163 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7464164 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7464165 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7464166 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7464167 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7464168 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7464169 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7464170 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7464171 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7464172 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7464173 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7464174 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7464175 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7464176 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7464177 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7464178 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7464179 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7464180 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7464181 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7464182 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7464183 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7464184 who are open to doing something on the production side
7464185 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7464186 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7464187 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7464188 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7464189 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7464190 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7464191 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7464192 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions he said
7464193 today we are faced with im not afraid to say a historic decision to call upon the president of the russian federation to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia bloomberg news agency quoted federation council speaker sergei mironov as saying
7464194 i have no idea about the funds because my mother has long been the one handling the familys money
7464195 this meeting will certainly improve bilateral relationship between the border guards of the two neighbours

7464231 uno es hacer que la gente se ponga c moda con barack obama el otro es definir la carrera electoral con claridad estableciendo a obama como un factor de cambio y a mccain como continuaci n de las pol ticas de bush tanto a nivel nacional como en el extranjero

7464233 no veo la alegr a que suele darse tras unas primarias
7464234 obama es un tipo que quiere unir al mundo pero que ha dividido al partido dem crata como nunca se hab a visto desde la guerra de vietnam

7464316 at the beginning of the summer driving season you offer a bill that would send gas prices up another 53 cents a gallon for goodness sake

7464319 we need a financial mechanism to create incentives for countries to conserve their forests and natural resources
7464320 to give them an alternative to cutting down their forests

7464333 the second i turned it over and it sounded like a tank and a harley i knew exactly what had occurred
7464334 everybody was seeing reports of this hearing reports of this talking to the local cops all over the country
7464335 this could end up being a significant capital investment and construction jobs just the fact that we have interest in developing wind energy industry increases the opportunity for spinoff in manufacturing and service for that industry such as wind towers blades and wind energy components as well as service
7464336 there are a large number of developers in northwest oklahoma
7464337 they are doing a lot of preliminary work to secure land for potential wind development thats common throughout the northwest part of the state
7464338 its a resource we have plenty of and we have the ability to bring wind as a potential growth opportunity for northwest oklahoma
7464339 its not just a matter of running a line through enid its a well defined process that projects must go through before transmission lines are built
7464340 we were looking for a security firm that could provide well trained officers who are committed to continual self improvement via education and training
7464341 security officers are the very first people that our employees and visitors see when they enter the tower and it is of paramount importance that they are friendly and professional
7464342 it was important that the security team we hire has a sound work ethic a professional appearance strong interpersonal skills and a commitment to training
7464343 in addition we needed to ensure that we hired qualified officers who act in a courteous manner to all visitors and employees without being star struck or intimidated celebrities pass through this building on a daily basis and we need our officers to treat them and all of our 2 000 building occupants with civility and professionalism
7464344 alliedbartons commitment to training as demonstrated with the alliedbarton academy was a major reason they were selected
7464345 they place primary importance on providing their security officers with up to date and comprehensive training in the physical security sector by offering both virtual and classroom training programs they can ensure our security officers are well versed in a wide variety of tactical and strategic information
7464346 we actively recruited the creme de la creme of security professionals
7464347 we sought career minded security professionals who were customer service focused and committed to training and education
7464348 prior to hiring alliedbarton our special event group hired outside consultants to handle security for events
7464349 today all of our events whether they are for internal or external audiences are handled by our in house security team
7464350 a commitment to training and education is important and i expect these officers to want to continually improve themselves
7464351 im pleased to say that our officers are exceeding my expectations we have an officer attending law school one who earned a masters degree and a large number of officers attending college as well as graduates we also have many officers with military and law enforcement experience
7464352 our professional development program for our officers includes master security officer accreditation fire safety and ready response and preparing our officers for supervisory roles
7464353 we are keeping good people longer by enhancing retention with training promotions and career development opportunities
7464354 these inspections help keep everyone on their toes to avoid becoming complacent
7464355 this is the first of its kind so we kind of get to be the ones to test it out
7464356 it was a challenging winter for them to say the least to work in the environment that we have here
7464357 theres a sense of urgency because this is an increasingly valuable natural resource at a time when significant growth is taking place in water short areas
7464358 it was declared dead several times before the governors came out with their recommendations
7464359 its been declared dead every couple of months since then but it keeps coming back like a cat with nine lives
7464360 no check engine llight comes on i dont even think theres a difference in mileage
7464361 at first we were seeing just basic die hard ethanol promoters and supporters using them
7464362 now we see a large percentage of our community using them
7464363 what an individual does is very difficult to control at the point of sale
7464364 i think any retailer will tell you that misfueling is not an uncommon occurrence
7464365 the best way to expand ethanol use is to expand the number of gas stations that offer e85 and not through the use of midlevel blends that could damage conventional vehicles
7464366 we are aware of this potential misfueling but cannot discuss specific investigations in process
7464367 the epa is working with industry sectors and states to assure compliance
7464368 the premise behind it is offering consumers a choice because theyre screaming for it
7464369 world workplace is so many things to so many professionals
7464370 it is a demonstration of leading products and companies a place where cutting edge facility strategies are shared and global issues such as sustainability are debated a forum for continuing education and a place to meet fellow professionals and friends it is also an opportunity for attendees to celebrate the advances made in the past 12 months and gain insight into the possibilities for the next year
7464371 the importance of sustainability is something that should resonate with everyone it transcends barriers cultures and languages
7464372 linking sustainability to strategy presents facility managers with an opportunity to get inside the executive suite because the decisions they make and actions they take affect the triple bottom line impacting the economic social and environmental success of their organizations
7464373 you can do it yourself you can add features you can add insulation but in terms of actually living in a way that maybe has some potential to help the environment i think you need the power of numbers
7464374 we were aware of green but weve become so much more aware
7464375 the idea was that if we were going to be developers and we are whether we like it or not we wanted to hold ourselves to the highest standards because not only did we recognize that we could lessen our carbon footprint and our impact on the environment but we could have an effect on every other person who chose to buy in
7464376 a key idea that has become common in both rural and suburban communities is preserving natural green spaces rather than just not destroying the land as badly which is sort of what any development is its scraping the life off the land and then putting cement and a thin veneer of life back on
7464377 acsi group developed a straightforward energy efficiency form that compares a customers fuel burner system with either a refurbished or new one we have proven the process by using it in the field with customers
7464378 as a result many companies have saved hundreds of dollars each year and reduced energy consumption that ultimately saves the natural resources of the earth
7464379 hinsdale hospital is always searching for better ways to save money as well as to conserve energy
7464380 not only was acsis estimation correct but it was even better than expected acsi had projected a 6 2 cost savings in natural gas resulting in a 3 8 years payback we surpassed that number significantly and are now looking at a 2 4 year payback it has contributed to the efficient operations of the hospitals heating and cooling systems as well as to the bottom line
7464381 in order to address climate change all major economies must be at the table and thats what took place
7464382 it is essential that developed countries take the lead in achieving ambitious and absolute greenhouse gas emissions reductions
7464383 developed countries should make explicit commitments to continue to take the lead in emissions reduction
7464384 chinas central task now is to develop the economy and make life better for the people
7464385 these results are an undeniable signal to our elected leaders that americans want job creating solar power now
7464386 solar development means job growth for americans by americans in an industry that will benefit america
7464387 rather than rely on foreign sources for fuel the u s can aspire to become the worlds leader in clean energy
7464388 the u s senate has an opportunity to act decisively by passing the renewable energy amp job creation act of 2008 h r 6049 this is smart policy that will help solar become a powerful economic engine for the country stabilize energy prices for consumers and businesses and improve americas national energy security a vote against this bill is a vote against what the vast majority of americans are demanding
7464389 when you consider that according to the american solar energy society nearly 7 000 gigawatts gw of solar generation capacity exists in the american southwest america is truly a sleeping giant
7464390 i think people now will take their problems their issues their concerns to doi where in the past sometimes that would happen but not nearly to the degree that it does now
7464391 that hit me at all sides because it hit me so early it molded how i began to operate
7464392 the mayor is tremendously supportive of me and the doi
7464393 hes not interested in sweeping things under the rug ever

7464399 es ist die sportliche entscheidung von fred rutten ob er ihn gleich wieder in den kader aufnimmt
7464400 aber ich gehe davon aus an rafinhas sportlichem wert gibt es ja keinen zweifel

7464404 la costruzione di unabitazione che produca da s tutta lenergia di cui ha bisogno garantendo comunque un comfort elevato gi un risultato di rilievo spiega vincenzo antonucci ingegnere ma lutilizzo della domotica nella gestione delle informazioni provenienti dai sistemi di cui abbiamo dotato il nostro prefabbricato pannelli solari e per il riscaldamento termico batterie celle a combustibile tutti integrati tra loro consente di immaginare un futuro in cui ci sar un interscambio continuo di energia tra lutente e la rete esterna alla quale sar collegato in modo da ottenere riduzione dei consumi diminuzione della produzione di anidride carbonica e scomparsa dei rischi di blackout
7464405 quando i pannelli solari raggiungono il massimo dellefficienza spiega lesperto del cnr una parte della corrente elettrica prodotta potr essere indirizzata allesterno nel caso in cui non fosse necessaria agli usi domestici viceversa in inverno si potr sopperire al loro minor rendimento prelevando dalla rete il fabbisogno di elettricit non soddisfatto autonomamente
7464406 i honestly believe that that will be the worst quarter of this whole downturn
7464407 theres a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace we also were affected by the weather weve had more of a winter than we had last year the tragedy at westroads i think the whole city mourned for a while people just didnt feel like going out and buying a house i think the combination of everything contributed to the market being off
7464408 but both of the last two years the springs were good but the summers were slow
7464409 it seems both years the market just ran out of steam inventory built and people waited
7464410 that took us into another dip where the consumer basically said im going to go sit on the sideline until some of this stuff works itself out
7464411 so even though it was not a strong quarter for sales it did improve the inventory
7464412 its bad for the builders but its good for the market overall
7464413 home values have depreciated over the last couple years and one of the markets where were seeing more sales its a bigger percentage of the total market activity than it would have been a year or two ago is the first time homebuyers
7464414 there is no question that the hottest price range for omaha for the year would be 120 000 to 140 000
7464415 our average sales price at cbshome probably went down 2 5 to 3 percent
7464416 i dont think theres any question that values have depreciated to some degree but not to any great degree
7464417 the prices are not going up but they are not dramatically dropping by any stretch of the imagination
7464418 the number of agents with buyers and the number of open houses has probably quadrupled from november and december and january
7464419 in the last three weeks its picked up from the previous three months
7464420 these are all signs that there is more activity more interest out there
7464421 theres a lot of pent up demand in the market people have been waiting in the market i think people now have a feeling that its as good as it is going to get and theyre coming back to the market

7464429 the penalty save changed the atmosphere in the ground and put an extra yard in the step of the newcastle players and we were rocking for four or five minutes
7464430 we saw that off and the defending from the corner that got the goal was fine but it was the second phase of that we didnt do well enough we should be either catching michael owen offside or should be picking him up
7464431 he is one of the best strikers in the world
7464432 i am still very positive because the fact is we have been beaten in the last minute of the game
7464433 over the whole period i thought we should have got at least something from the game after we scored two very good goals
7464434 it is too early to start cutting up players as it were we have played two games in the premier league and weve scored six goals
7464435 so scoring doesnt seem to be our problem at the moment
7464436 i wouldnt be out here if i wasnt 100 but like anything you cant have the illness that ive had and then just go and train and then after two minutes go and play straight away
7464437 you need to almost harden your body like last season when the manager took over i played all 20 games under his reign and there wasnt even an ounce of a problem because your body gets hardened to playing

7464440 le quiero decir al secretario general de la oea nuestro amigo insulza le quiero decir con todo respeto el proceso electoral en nicaragua lo decidimos los nicarag enses

7464442 nosotros creemos que es posible avanzar en negociaciones con bloques y frentes y ofrecerles una salida digna venimos haciendo un an lisis muy cuidadoso de la situaci n de hecho hemos tenido contactos con algunos mandos importantes de frentes y bloques de la guerrilla tanto de las farc como del eln y vemos que es viable avanzar en esas desmovilizaciones
7464443 hay cansancio eso lo hemos evidenciado hay p rdida del sentido de lucha y por eso creemos que hay una situaci n madura para las desmovilizaciones colectivas el reto es convencerlos de que tambi n con ellos podemos pactar procesos dignos
7464444 es indudable que la capacidad militar del erg se disminuy de manera significativa por la ofensiva militar si no es as ellos no habr an recapacitado pero tambi n se les ofreci una negociaci n digna estamos interesados en enviar ese mensaje que el gobierno sabe tender la mano
7464445 no podemos ilusionarnos con di logos con c pulas rezagadas y soberbias que no han hecho otra cosa que jugar con la esperanza de paz de todo el pa s siguen sin entender que en colombia y el mundo ya no hay espacio para la lucha armada pero si estas c pulas se bajan de su arrogancia el gobierno tiende los puentes del di logo

7464460 we dont want to be spending all our energy printing papers that people take directly to the recyclers
7464461 there is a voracious demand in china and india for recycled paper
7464462 the problem was that most carriers had terrible creditworthiness and couldnt hedge
7464463 counter parties feared the carriers would renege on their trades
7464464 january was just a case of me feeling like i deserved the opportunity to play and not getting it
7464465 you always feel a little bit hard done by in those circumstances but i respect the players
7464466 i respect the fact that we have a lot of ability people like benni mccarthy matt derbyshire roque santa cruz its always going to be tough to play and i respect that
7464467 but obviously you feel like youve earned that right and you feel disappointed
7464468 im happy now because im playing and the next time that changes i wont be happy
7464469 im glad im here and hopefully ill be here for years to come scoring goals
7464470 i still dont think blackburn have seen the best of me so hopefully that will be coming
7464471 i feel sharp at the moment people have shown belief in me and given the opportunity to show what i can do so hopefully i can grab that with both hands
7464472 ive had a good pre season scored a few goals and felt sharp
7464473 but thats happened previously and ive not had the opportunity to get a run so its just good to get a run in the side now and have it to lose so to speak
7464474 ive played the games and as far as im concerned i need to keep on playing well and trying to make sure that i start in the next game
7464475 weve got quality players all over the park you look at our bench and you know youre playing well to be starting
7464476 but at the moment i feel like its all coming together and hopefully blackburn will get to see the best of me
7464477 its good you know what youre going to get from roque
7464478 hes always going to give 100 percent hes always going to provide a goal threat
7464479 the more we play together the more we understand each others game well just keep endeavouring to do that
7464480 after the first few games we needed to come down here and put on a real workman like performance and be strong at the back and to be fair it wasnt just at the back the whole team defended really well
7464481 we frustrated crystal palace in the first half which we wanted to do it wasnt pretty football from us probably but after the last couple of weeks we needed just to get a foot on the ladder and we did that
7464482 coming to crystal palace youre not going to boss the game for 90 minutes so the plan was to frustrate them first and get our way into the game
7464483 so it gave us a platform to go on from there
7464484 the way the second half went we needed to score we wanted the three points but wed have taken a point and a clean sheet before the game
7464485 i caught the volley quite well it just happened to be straight down the keepers throat
7464486 we had quite a few shots and near misses especially in the second half you just need a bit of a break maybe a deflection or maybe not hit it so well and it goes in the bottom corner anything like that but were happy with a clean sheet and a point that gets us on the board and hopefully we can build on that
7464487 we had a little bit of a change of mentality from the previous two games we didnt go straight out to win the game from minute one and i think that saw us well into half time
7464488 i dont think wed been troubled that much there was a little bit of pressure but no actual clear cut chances that gave us confidence in the second half obviously the game changed when they went down to 10 and nine men but were happy with what we got
7464489 obviously preparing olympians doesnt require an assembly line approach but the same types of goal setting and measurement tracking methods used in manufacturing and other industries can help spur athletes to optimum performance
7464490 when we examined our everyday use of cardboard we became aware of the quantity of packaging materials we should recycle appalled at the amount of material we couldnt and frustrated by an inability to reuse most of it

7464498 who is to blame for the argos woeful 3 5 season
7464499 its a tough loss as far as where were trying to go
7464500 but it was a pretty well played ball game so i dont have a problem with that
7464501 i thought he threw his second best pitch a lot his curveball and he got himself in trouble
7464502 a walks a walk no matter what pitch you throw
7464503 the whole problem there was that the ball beat stairs home
7464504 ninety five per cent of the time theyre going to call them out
7464505 bottom line the loss is my fault i had the lead twice and i gave it back both times
7464506 a game like today the importance of the game you cant let that happen
7464507 it would have been a good pitch if i didnt hang it
7464508 it created more of a side issue it became bigger than the team and the team is always bigger than the one part
7464509 coach rich stubler wanted to move on and i tried to do the best thing for michael
7464510 i guess a lot of the guys wanted me to be in there
7464511 theres always a certain bit of that when youre not playing well
7464512 sometimes when you have two choices it creates a problem
7464513 its just human nature and can be a problem especially when youre losing focus on what you really want to do win games play together and win the grey cup
7464514 michael bishop and kerry joseph didnt miss tackles or drop the ball theyre part of it but our team just has to play better football
7464515 we will do whatever it takes to get our team to play better as a team
7464516 i think we have as good a chance as anybody in the league
7464517 theres not much difference between the top and the bottom and quite truthfully were not at the bottom but we still have a chance to fight our way back and become a force its up to the players first and then the coaches

7464523 from start to finish they were just incredible a terrific bunch of guys
7464524 they gave a better feeling of a team it wasnt so much individual talent or individual team
7464525 im elated and im convinced more than ever that the fact we had this team together for three years for the most part was the telling difference in this game
7464526 it was a great game it was a pressure game from the get go and we never cracked
7464527 i think the fact we were together for that period of time was the difference i really do
7464528 i want to play in 2012 but who knows they might want another point guard so im just trying to cherish the moment and remember this for as long as i can
7464529 i think its going to elevate the image of basketball worldwide

7464533 the use of this image is in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7464534 the mayor is deeply concerned by the realisation that a shot of myra hindley was shown in a short video at london house and asked that it not be shown again
7464535 of all the many masterpieces that could have been used this was the most regrettable and the least inspired choice
7464536 i do find it utterly extraordinary that if were trying to promote britain we should do so with an image of an mass child murder
7464537 somebody somewhere has taken an extraordinary decision that i dont think brings any credit on the country at all
7464538 the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade
7464539 there has never been a complaint made about the video up until this point
7464540 however if any offence has been caused we will withdraw it from use with immediate effect
7464541 i dont believe we will succeed in bringing the corpses back

7464600 tunisia is a good team just like all the others that get this far we can only go for the result we need which is a win
7464601 of course everyone loves playing at home but this team has won away before and we can win anywhere
7464602 i would prefer to focus on getting each player ready and not what tunisia can do
7464603 in the first half we played well but wasted so many chances to score
7464604 i realised that there was a lot of complacency on the players and i told them to get the goals in the second half
7464605 during the pep talk i demanded a positive approach and not the negative approach they had shown to the game
7464606 those were my key words and they changed in the second half and i am happy
7464607 we were the underdogs in the game and we tried our best
7464608 i am disappointed to lose but i am happy with the performance
7464609 i think youve lost it but im going to go along with it because ive learned better than to ask

7464617 this magnificent manchester united side simply refuse to give up yesterday when all seemed lost when the german jinx again appeared to hold sway over an english side united scored twice in the final seconds through teddy sheringham and ole gunnar solskjaer to lift the european cup on the day that marked sir matt busbys 90th birthday amazing
7464618 manchester united painted the russian capital red sending their fans partying into red square after an absorbing draining collision between english heavyweights here the red theme intensified with a vengeance with didier drogbas dismissal for slapping nemanja vidic before united prevailed on penalties cristiano ronaldo and john terry both missed in the penalty shoot out forcing sudden death and nicolas anelka saw chelseas seventh penalty saved uniteds victory was awash with history no more fitting tribute to the 50th anniversary of munich could be imagined than the sight of fergusons adventurous young team shining on the european stage no more appropriate celebration of the 40 years since united first lifted the trophy could be scripted than this triumph for the new holy trinity of ronaldo wayne rooney and carlos tevez

7464648 they played good we played bad and therefore thats what makes for the score i dont think we had that little zip in our step that we had in our last couple of games and all around the field we were just below average
7464649 it was a letdown on our part i think after we went down two to nothing the first two goals definitely let us down i thought before that we were playing some good soccer and after that we basically put ourselves out of the game and we were still trying to get back into the game and the ball didnt bounce our way and we paid for it the rest of the game
7464650 i think it was one of those nights for us its pretty rare it happens once or twice a season if that and we were poor tonight from myself up to the front guys no one really had a good game tonight
7464651 tonight we didnt match them physically we didnt match them tactically and we got soundly beaten and got what we deserved

7464703 while we do have the legal authority to interact with transit passengers we would normally only do so where there was intelligence to indicate a threat was present

7464784 we were really proud of her its amazing what she has achieved she is an incredibly bright pupil the school made a really big deal of her achievement she will be representing the british people in beijing
7464785 they gave her such a shock she had been hoping she would win but i dont think she could believe it when she actually did

7464813 the release of our brother husam khader will strengthen palestinian action in the defense of the rights of palestinian refugees this is man accustomed to stand solidly and bravely he does not compromise on the right of return
7464814 the release of palestinian prisoners is an inevitable outcome of the palestinian struggle to uphold our rights
7464815 he was carrying the banner of the faithful to return the rights of refugees and a fierce defender here in the back yard of the darkest of circumstances this mans calling was to be solid and courageous in his positions
7464816 the release of the leader hussam khader is long awaited he has been the corner stone of the return movement which is a movement that is expanding day by day
7464817 live in the worst conditions and are subjected to all forms of humiliation and physical and psychological torture
7464818 will have a significant impact throughout the world in defending the rights of refugees
7464819 a case has been registered against the malaysian social service a chennai based private company licensed by the indian government for having sent at least 120 children for adoption abroad our investigations found a simple modus operandi street children were kidnapped for a mere rs 500 and given for adoption abroad for sums ranging from as low as rs 10 000 to as high as 10 000 per child
7464820 obviously kidnapped children have been passed off by impostors claiming to be their mothers donating them for adoption their real parents may not even be aware where their children are and may not have received a single rupee as compensation
7464821 while bringing the guilty to book may be a problem due to the absence of complainants disturbing children living abroad with emotional moorings may prove counterproductive as none of them would like to return to a poverty stricken life back home
7464822 many foreign countries do not recognise indian laws or some can reject efforts to prosecute alleged wrongdoers outright because their deeds may not constitute an offence in the countries where the children are living now
7464823 it is up to them headquarters to reveal our findings
7464824 we hope to make more arrests but currently we are not in a position to divulge any details
7464825 it was a cowardly act we at sahmat strongly protest such dastardly acts all that the exhibition had were reproductions of some of husains works and his own photographs by some eminent photographers
7464826 the miscreants who had thrown pamphlets with jai shri ram sena written on them after having attacked the exhibition are most welcome to do it again our decision to extend the exhibition in the as it is condition after the attack is just a way to show that we will not give in to the hands of such forces
7464827 but these eight to 10 miscreants must have done their homework well they were not carrying any weapons but used the chairs lying around to destroy things
7464828 its time someone stood against such miscreants who have dragged art into murky politics i salute sahmats attitude
7464829 do these miscreants who call themselves guardians of religion even understand what religion is do they understand what art is which painting of husains in sahmats exhibition hurt their sentiments
7464830 without understanding they go on vandalising art shows and exhibitions which is absolutely condemnable
7464831 on the one hand we talk about freedom of expression and creativity about democracy and on the other we have such forces trying to impose their narrow beliefs with force its an increasingly intolerant society that we are living in
7464832 we as organisers have the highest regard and huge respect for the legendary m f husain
7464833 the artist himself understands the situation and it is an indirect way of husain blessing the event he knows our problems this is public space and we are exhibiting works worth crores of rupees i could not expose the show to any kind of risk it was my duty to safeguard everyones interest
7464834 we will provide all required support to facilitate setting up of the plant
7464835 the honda car plant being set up in khushkhera from where cars are expected to roll out next year stands testimony to the investor friendly climate in the state
7464836 this is a terrible predicament for a family that loves their adopted child and for the indian family that has lost a child and as a mother my heart goes out to them
7464837 under the hague convention birth parents may bring an action in an australian court to have the adoption revoked however any decision would be a matter for the courts which would apply the principle of protecting the best interests of the child
7464838 under australian law these children are australian citizens and the children of the adoptive parents
7464839 i am advised that adoptions from india have to be authorised by a court the adoption of the queensland child who was allegedly stolen was authorised by the madras high court in march 2000 asqs role was to approve families as suitable adoptive families and to send the file to overseas countries for processing
7464840 i am advised that asq dealt with the official indian government adoption agency the central adoption resource authority cara and malaysian social services mss a cara endorsed agency all adoption placement agencies in india had to be registered with cara
7464841 let us hope the inquiry in fact does not find that children have been effectively kidnapped and the right thing we would expect in most cases will be to look at returning them to their rightful families

7464886 5 perlu diketahui dengan itu bahawa alam keseluruhannya adalah islam iaitu dalam keadaan selamat dan menurut perintah penciptanya sehinggalah allah menjadikan mahluk yang diberikan kebolehan untuk mencampakkan diri mereka ke lembah tidak selamat dengan adanya akal dan nafsu manusia menjadi mahluk yang paling banyak diberikan pilihan untuk melaksanakan kehidupan segala gala yang dibentuk pada awalnya boleh dimanfaatkan untuk manusia terbatas hanya kepada kepintaran akal malangnya semua ini tidak berikan begitu sahaja melainkan akan dipertanggung jawabkan kepada manusia segala apa yang dia pilih untuk melakukannya allah sentiasa memberikan garis panduan melalui kitab kitab dan rasul rasulnya agar manusia mendapat cara menjalankan kehidupan sesuai kehendaknya
7464887 3 allah tidak bertindak untuk terus menegur manusia dengan secara terus melalui pemberian syariat tertentu pada awalnya sebagaimana tidak adanya disebut al quran behubung permberian kitab atau suhuf kepada nabi adam bagaimanapun al quran menceritakan bagaimana anak anak nabi adam belajar dari persekitaran alam dengan meniru gaya perlakuan binatang melakukan sesuatu ini merupakan bukti bahawa allah memberikan manusia kepercayaan penuh terhadap kepandaian mereka menggunakan akal yang baru diberikan hanya selepas beberapa waktu manusia semakin jauh menyimpang dari landasan asal barulah allah bertindak mengwahyukan kepada orang orang pilihannya untuk membawa peringatan secara terperinci
7464888 islam adalah cara hidup yang diterima allah islam itu dari sejak azali kesemua mahluk di dalam keadaan islam selamat sebelum allah beriradah memberikan cukup akal kepada manusia pertama iaitu n adam as selepas itu dengan berbekalkan akal dan ilmu tanggungjawab juga terpikul ke atas bahu manusia dari segala pilihan yang dibuatnya isu kahlifah adalah isu kepimpinan dan kepimpinan itu bermula dari roh yang memimpin diri dan akhirnya mencapai kepada kepimpinan kepada sekumpulan diri atau masyarakat ini yang dikatakan politik kepimpinan masyarakat maka disebabkan islam itu adalah cara hidup dan ia berkisar kepada usul maarifatullah sebagai asas agama kesemua politik atau kepimpinan masyarakat semestinya berpaksikan kepada ketuhanan lari dari asas tersebut maka ia tidak menajdi islam lagi
7464889 hampir semua tamadun purba ada kesan wahyu dan kenabian padanya biar pun sulit untuk kita buktikan secara jazam
7464890 tetapi tamadun eropah nyata berbeza tiada nabi yang diutus untuk mereka selain nabi muhammad saw sebagaimana kita
7464891 bagaimana kesan yang hanya mampu dicetus oleh sari pati tauhid boleh kelihatan dalam banyak aspek kehidupan eropah hari ini
7464892 5 islam itu jelas dari mula islam itu memberikan penekanan kepada mengenal dan mentauhidkan allah dari mula mengesakan allah tidak berubah dari awal sehinggalah ke nabi terakhir walaupun syariat berubah mengikut zaman sesuai tahap kepandaian manusia menggunakan akal yang diberikan allah dari mulanya dan tahap penggunaan akal manusia masih terus berkembang sesuai penemuan penemuan ilmu alam semulajadi yang baru oleh manusia maka setiap kali pengamal islam terkeluar dari landasan tauhid allah menurunkan kitab dan persuruhnya untuk memperbetulkan keadaan yang terkeluar dari landasan inilah yang akhirnya menamakan diri mereka lain dari islam contohnya menjadi yahudi majusi nasrani dan sebagainya dengan islam sebagai asas

7464934 die kapitalgedeckte vorsorge beinhaltet zwar ebenfalls renditerisiken aber diese sind geringer als bei der gesetzlichen rentenversicherung
7464935 die wahrscheinlichkeit mit einem aktiendepot auf sicht von 30 jahren eine negative rendite zu erzielen ist an historischen werten gemessen praktisch null
7464936 das renditerisiko der gesetzlichen rentenversicherung ist im vergleich zum risiko von kapitalanlagen erheblich
7464937 die ergebnisse sprechen auf jeden fall f r eine hohe gewichtung der kapitalanlagen

7464949 unfortunate events took place the first time that a jury was empanelled to try the accused mr wood
7464950 i had to discharge the jury because some jurors disobeyed my instructions and misconducted themselves
7464951 at some considerable public expense and inconvenience to a lot of people i had to stop the trial
7464952 its possible that every member of this jury panel will have heard about read about or seen some report or comment about this case over the past few years
7464953 the court is anxious to ensure that every juror who tries this case can be completely impartial
7464954 you are absolutely forbidden to make your own inquiries about this trial
7464955 lo vemos exageradamente light si bien todas las reformas han salido muy light esta se pasa para mi gusto

7464957 the way he says hes going to run this campaign
7464958 but donna would you rather this election be about ayers versus keating or about the economy and george bush
7464959 in this years campaign soggy with environmental messianism deranged self importance and delusional economics the question is where is the derisive laughter
7464960 dont let this continue because something serious is going to happen
7464961 caribbean culture at the crossroads seeking the past living the present exploring the future

7464964 i wish everything could be done at the same time
7464965 we are hoping that carifesta adds to the cultural infrastructure
7464966 my government is determined to support the arts however parlous our economic situation

7464976 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it
7464977 we will have to see what other issues were present
7464978 this action frequent removal was not the case until obasanjo came and introduced it and it appears it has become a national policy if you appoint service chiefs and they are not doing well definitely it cannot be all of them that are not doing well you remove the erring one and give reasons why such action is taken
7464979 partner with us to build the man for a virile nation
7464980 what is the importance of this now that you know that all men lie and at an average we tell five lies a day try to shy away from that given pattern
7464981 any attempt to sweep the matter under the carpet would not be accepted
7464982 the whole world is aware already of the fraud that the commission has become and this is one case these people cannot use money to influence therefore we are giving them 30 days to tell us the outcome of the investigation if not we will go and protest before the president because of the due process that he is campaigning if it does not work out then we will take other ways to make it work
7464983 they dress in provocative gears that reveal as much flesh as any professional when the average teen girl is old enough she wants to go out and have sex where and when she wishes with any lad who takes her fancy and her biggest ambition is to sleep with variouscelebrities the more atrocious the better they used to be interested in kissing and courting but now sexual behaviour seems to have turned a corner and for some a night out is nothing if they dont get straight down to copulation raw sex and instant gratification its the sexual version of a take away
7464984 we tolerate a culture that seems to teach girls the most noteworthy attribute they can have about sexiness
7464985 the problem now is that the sexualizing is aimed towards younger and younger girls
7464986 i must commend the organizers of this election for it was well conducted the only election in this country that i can liken this cross river governorship re run election to is the june 12 election it is one of the best elections we have had in this country you know initially people were skeptical about the election will the election hold or not as the clan head of this place i had to go out to tell people to vote and they eventually responded
7464987 i voted for the pdp because imoke resumed the payment of our stipends he has respect for the traditional institution
7464988 the initial low turn out may not be unconnected with the olympics football match this morning between nigeria and argentina it was played between 5 00 a m and 7 00 a m some people had to wake up very early in the morning to watch the match and after the match they went back to sleep and woke up again much much later that may have contributed to the initial low turn out but later the people gradually began to come out knowing they had to carry out their civic responsibility
7464989 i have been in politics for the past 30 years and i have always pursued the need to empower the human person any government that is prepared for the investment on man i am prepared to support imoke says he wants to develop cross river and if it is the development of human capital i endorse that if you develop human capital i support that because thats why i have been in politics if you give man education if he is healthy and has basic needs then he creates wealth that is why it is so important to develop the human capital
7464990 while we are crying everyday of nddc under development some dubious officials and consultants are calculating how to hijack the little that is available for themselves
7464991 the visit will enable us to conduct inspections and purchase the required artistic and musical equipment for the project
7464992 the efforts of the akwa ibom state governor at resettling the returnee indigenes of the state from bakassi is highly commendable we are highly satisfied with what we have so far seen at the site prepared for the returnees
7464993 the coroner law system is not necessarily directed at just any death arising from malaria or typhoid in the regular course of ailments and their incidental aftermaths its more than that it involves such intricate questions targeted at unraveling the truth in circumstances where a man who is alleged to have died of a suicidal jump from a high rise is found upon inquest to have been lacerated with bullet wounds before his alleged jump from the high rise building
7464994 once the missile defense system is put in place it will work automatically with the entire nuclear capability of the united states it will be an integral part of the us nuclear capability and for the first time in history and i want to emphasize this there will be elements of the us nuclear capability on the european continent it simply changes the whole configuration of international security of course we have to respond to that
7464995 us missiles in europe beyond deterrence to first strike threat
7464996 by means of a us first strike about 99 of russian nuclear forces would be taken out
7464997 some people have the illusion that you can do everything just as you want regardless of the interests of other people of course it is for precisely this reason that the international situation gets worse and eventually results in an arms race but we are not the instigators we do not want it why would we want to divert resources to this and we are not jeopardizing our relations with anyone but we must respond name even one step that we have taken or one action of ours designed to worsen the situation there are none we are not interested in that we are interested in maintaining a good atmosphere
7464998 it would be better to look for other ways to fight terrorism than create low yield nuclear weapons that lower the threshold for using these weapons and thereby put humankind on the brink of nuclear catastrophe
7464999 i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security
7465000 we acted on tip off there are hundreds of illegal local refining points close to either refinery pipelines or existing pipelines belonging to one of the oil majors some of the pipelines were ruptured by militants or illegal oil bunkerers then they use crude method to refine and later sell to the public let us use this opportunity to correct earlier reports that we discovered illegal refineries they are refining points and not refineries
7465001 if we want to take that illegal step i e killing them we would not have mentioned the arrest as a lawyer i cant be involved in extra judicial killing it is just a figment of imagination if we had planned to kill we would not have mentioned that we arrested this number that tuesday

7465021 irans aussage von der zerst rung israels darf in der bersetzung nicht verloren gehen
7465022 die dpa wird in zukunft bei der berichterstattung darauf achten dass der iranische pr sident mahmud ahmadinedschad nicht die ausl schung israels oder dessen tilgung von der landkarte gefordert hat
7465023 dieser satz den der iranische pr sident tats chlich formuliert hat ist eine v lkerrechtlich korrekte forderung da haben die katholischen bisch fe vor ein paar wochen sich noch viel drastischer ber die israelische ghetto politik ge u ert
7465024 die zionisten werfen uns vorbereitungen auf einen m glichen angriff vor das ist aber eine l ge die iranische nation hat nie in ihrer geschichte jemanden angegriffen
7465025 meinen sie nicht dass diese positionen in irgendeiner weise dazu beitragen iran von der internationalen gemeinschaft zu isolieren
7465026 was ich ber das zionistische regime gesagt habe war vor allem eine ank ndigung was ich ank ndigte war dass dieses regime sich bald aufl st und zusammenbricht
7465027 der einfluss der zionisten auf die westlichen und europ ischen staaten f hrt leider solche tumulte herbei und dann nutzen sie auch noch die gelegenheit aus dies mit einem atomenergie problem in verbindung zu bringen jener ignorant der dies zum ersten mal sagte hat gar nicht verstanden dass die atomwaffe f r die beseitigung von regierungen und systemen und regimen nicht taugt systeme und regime verschwinden nicht mit hilfe der atomwaffe die atomwaffe kann nur menschen und landstriche vernichten
7465028 das zionistische regime das ein usurpations und illegales regime und ein krebsgeschw r ist mu von der landkarte getilgt werden
7465029 das zionistische regime sieht seinem absoluten ende entgegen das korrupte element wird von der landkarte getilgt werden
7465030 oh lieber imam khomeini du hattest einst zu sagen geruht dass das zionistische regime ein usurpations und illegales regime und ein krebsgeschw r ist das von der seite des zeitenlaufs verschwinden muss heute nun entbiete ich ihnen respektvoll meine antwort diese erleuchtende und weg weisende rede und dieses ihr sehnen sind an der schwelle frucht zu tragen das zionistische regime hat die philosophie f r seine existenz aus der hand gegeben das zionistische regime befindet sich in einer absoluten sackgasse und ihr wunsch imam chomeini wird bald wirklichkeit und dieser keim der verderbnis wird verschwinden
7465031 es gibt keinen zweifel die neue anschlagswelle in pal stina wird das stigma im antlitz der islamischen welt ausradieren
7465032 ich zweifle nicht daran dass die neue welle die im geliebten pal stina begonnen hat und welche wir heute in der islamischen welt beobachten eine welle der moral ist sie hat die gesamte islamische welt erfasst und wird sehr bald den schandfleck aus dem scho der islamischen welt beseitigen
7465033 der iranische pr sident mahmud ahmadinedschad hat dem staat israel mit der vernichtung gedroht der j dische staat sei auf dem weg zur vernichtung
7465034 so wie die sowjetunion verschwunden ist wird auch das zionistische regime verschwinden und die menschheit wird befreit sein
7465035 dass dieses jerusalem besetzende regime von den seiten der zeit getilgt werden muss
7465036 unser lieber imam khomeini hatte zu sagen geruht das regime das jerusalem besetzt h lt m sse aus den annalen der geschichte verschwinden
7465037 mit seiner u erung israel von der landkarte tilgen zu wollen sorgte irans pr sident mahmud ahmadinedschad im oktober 2005 weltweit f r emp rung
7465038 immer wieder sorgt irans pr sident mahmud ahmadinedschad f r aufsehen durch seine israelfeindlichen und antisemitischen u erungen
7465039 dies ist eine kurze phase wenn wir sie mit erfolg hinter uns gebracht haben wird so gott will der prozess des verschwindens des regimes das al qods die heilige jerusalem besetzt h lt und die einrichtung der nationalen regierung pal stinas ein glatter und einfacher vorgang sein
7465040 irans talk of destroying israel must not get lost in translation
7465041 die iranische f hrung in ihren eigenen worten ber die vernichtung israels ein pl doyer gegen apologetische kampagnen zur entschuldung des aufrufs zum v lkermord
7465042 what iranian leaders really say about doing away with israel a refutation of the campaign to excuse ahmadinejads incitement to genocide

7465044 the zionist regime is a decaying and crumbling tree that will fall with a storm

7465058 now i dont know if she lived with family members or had a significant other half but she bandaged that breast up and went about and she had to be in tremendous pain when she came here she was almost dead and she died shortly after there was nothing we could have done
7465059 carrying around her breast in that condition for almost two years
7465060 and then they come running and when they come for some of them is already too late
7465061 hush up hush up but some of the doctors dont know how to treat it

7465065 transit passengers often have no contact at all with our officers
7465066 while we do have the legal authority to interact with transit passengers we would normally only do so where there was intelligence to indicate a threat was present
7465067 we share intelligence with agencies all around the world but we do not get every drug smuggler or every shipment of contraband that comes our way

7465080 there is need for research on how best to tax the charcoal industry potential taxation and revenue from legalised charcoal production needs to lead to creation of a sustainable industry
7465081 this current illegal status has driven production underground contributing towards corruption makeshift and inefficient production methods
7465082 cleaner alternatives to charcoal such as liquified petroleum gas lpg and briquettes are unlikely to fulfil the energy demands of low income households
7465083 many of these problems stem from the fact that charcoal is perceived as illegal due to negative impacts on the environment yet it is an allowable a source of energy
7465084 kenya has to introduce buffer zones where sustainable charcoal production can be practised in areas bordering protected eco zones to check human wildlife conflicts

7465094 what happens now i think is that they transfer a part of it to the consolidated fund if there is a 50 million project the sum required is transferred to the consolidated fund
7465095 in open and unashamed violation of article 216 of the guyana constitution this money has not been paid into the consolidated fund all of this money has been deposited into special bank account no 3119 under the control of the minister of finance
7465096 so when you say that billions of dollars in advances are outstanding it could just be a timing difference
7465097 this is not real cash it is not money to be spent it is a book entry it is not money that you can transfer to the government and the government spends in that fiscal year it is just an accounting entry to say that billions are lying in dormant accounts create the impression there is money to be spent and the government is not transferring it because of some corrupt motive
7465098 these accounts werent closed and we had a long process when we took office to clean that up it is not real money there is a difference between accounting dollar and an economic dollar huge difference the auditor general deals with the accounting dollar and the finance ministry deals with the economic dollar

7465128 dont apply for a job you wont accept some folks suggest applying for everything because it gives you practice and you never know the reality is that its more paperwork and hassle for the folks on the search committee ask yourself if you would accept an offer for the position before you apply
7465129 no i do not want to work with these people

7465132 attendance of the company officials was normal but that of the contractual workers was less than normal
7465133 essentially when we are designing a boss health recovery is built in the design we could drop health orbs at some percentages of the creatures overall life and thats what we do with rares and champions actually so those guys a sort of mini bosses get a chance to drop health orbs when youre fighting them in a bigger boss fight which is more structured we could provide some small creatures for health weve considered out a fight where we use the wells like in diablo 2 that bubble up over times so you might have multiple of those then you have to run over and hit them for health and for a certain amount of time you cant use them and then they come back so there are a lot of different ways how to do this and really the idea is that when we are a designing a boss we should figure out how health recovery could be an interesting mechanic for this boss
7465134 yes there are some ways for the characters one example is the barbarian skill bloodthirst but we didnt decide if we keep this skill or kick it in the final version it is like a temporary boost buff for yourself to recover health by killing enemies so there are other ways to recover and we didnt remove the potions they are a lot less effective and you cant use them very often they should be used in emergency situations
7465135 for me there is a big difference between difficulty and challenge challenge is compelling like challenge is basically the illusion of difficulty when you feel a game is really challenging then the game is exciting difficulty is where the game is hard and frustrating so difficulty we try to avoid and challenge we totally want to embrace and one of the problems i think diablo 2 had it would feel difficult and easy but almost never challenging you had almost infinite resources and health so as a designer our only option in this case to actually challenge you is to crush you with damage anything less then just crushing you like one shotting you with damage is not gonna challenge or scary you cause you could instantly recover your health so what we are trying to do is essentially create a game where it is a challenge to just surviving and in which we dont have to make the monsters crush you again we could actually reduce the damage they do quite a bit because essentially entering a fight with them is something you have to do and you have to do it with limited health and that makes the game more exiting and more challenging and we are really trying to make it not difficult

7465151 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behavior and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people
7465152 but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behavior are not well understood
7465153 this latest study used functional brain imaging to identify the circuits in the brain that underpin our ability to differentiate social behavior that conforms to our values from behaviour that does not
7465154 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
7465155 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
7465156 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
7465157 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
7465158 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention

7465168 it is more about him mendis if he bowls a bad ball then punish him and build up pressure on him if you continue to defend him then you know he will also be on top
7465169 it is very important that whenever he bowled a bad bowl we will get runs out of them so that you know he mendis gets under a bit of pressure
7465170 i think s badri nath s effort was great he took on mendis he went for a big shot but that is what you need to do at times to put some pressure on the bowler till now he mendis was never under any sort of pressure so he was bowling at his best

7465245 over the last one week tata motors has slowly and steadily gained ground despite what was happening over the next 2 3 weeks we could probably see some sort of solution arising so i am pretty hopeful that things would proceed smoothly after about 2 3 weeks nevertheless the stock has corrected almost 50 from the top and in the current year we have seen margin pressure raw material input costs moving up sharply interest rates moving up slowdown in the economy taking its toll on slower growth in vehicle sell etc even if you factor a 25 drop in its net profit its quoting at about 10 times so i am pretty hopeful that tata motors at the current juncture warrants investment only with a long term
7465246 we could see the price of about rs 550 or even more than that for the next 6 9 months

7465276 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7465277 forcibly sent back to their home towns and put under monitoring and residential surveillance
7465278 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world
7465279 and i believe that this is something that will have positive effects on the long term
7465280 the chinese people now can proudly announce to the world we have lived up to the trust of the international community and the ioc
7465281 the world can also say with gratification we have made a correct decision by selecting beijing and china as the olympic host
7465282 a country that makes constant progress emphasizes friendship and harmony keeps its promises and respects all international rules
7465283 the chinese authorities have blatantly and successfully used the games to achieve political goals putting the international community on notice that china is a powerful gold medal state and stoking patriotism and national pride among countless chinese
7465284 yet the carefully orchestrated facade could not conceal a police state that tramples on human rights
7465285 the total costs of staging a show of national glorification
7465286 the 2008 beijing games have put an end once and for all to the notion that these olympics are a force for good
7465287 the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7465288 while insisting on the apolitical nature of the event the ioc enabled the chinese government to ignore its olympics promises and exploit the olympics as a political tool to achieve nationalistic goals at the expense of its people
7465289 establish a permanent mechanism to monitor the human rights performance and compliance of future olympic host countries
7465290 the ioc consistently demonstrated that it was unwilling to use its influence to push chinas communist leaders to make even basic reforms
7465291 without intervention now i can guarantee that russia will deliver a repeat performance of chinas most grievous human rights abuses
7465292 in politics when you want to bury bad news you make sure it hits late friday and saturday so why did barack obama hold off on his announcement of joe biden as his veep pick until the slowest possible news cycle
7465293 by waiting until the weekend barack obama was able to skirt any and all scrutiny public vetting or criticism by rush limbaugh and the rest of conservative talk radio and cable television in other words he wanted no bad news and was confident he would get ample positive coverage from the mainstream media
7465294 the media is putty in the hands of barack obama

7465296 to offset the tax increases that otherwise occur inexorably each year as incomes rise with inflation lifting people into higher tax brackets
7465297 to limit personal income tax relief to one round of rate cuts and to tilt the relief toward those who earn less than 50 000 a year
7465298 raised the top income tax rate from 28 to 33 percent for married couples earning more than 78 400 a year and individuals earning more than 47 050 increased the minimum tax from 21 to 25 percent and imposed a 10 percent surcharge on taxable income for one person exceeding 1 million a year

7465356 its possible that every member of this jury panel will have heard about read about or seen some report or comment about this case over the past few years
7465357 the court is anxious to ensure that every juror who tries this case can be completely impartial
7465358 you are absolutely forbidden to make your own inquiries about this trial

7465410 it is more about him mendis if he bowls a bad ball then punish him and build up pressure on him if you continue to defend him then you know he will also be on top
7465411 it is very important that whenever he bowled a bad bowl we will get runs out of them so that you know he mendis gets under a bit of pressure
7465412 i think s badri nath s effort was great he took on mendis he went for a big shot but that is what you need to do at times to put some pressure on the bowler till now he mendis was never under any sort of pressure so he was bowling at his best
7465413 it is better to have a contributory effort while winning a match but we are not relying on one individual
7465414 if you will have the privilege of getting individual performances like zaheer played well in the last match in this match also he has bowled well

7465799 it is a gesture towards the palestinian leadership to strengthen moderate and pragmatic forces
7465800 it is not easy release prisoners and particularly those who have been involved in murderous terrorist attacks
7465801 releasing these kinds of prisoners indicates that the criteria israel used in the past will not endure this clears the way for other prisoners
7465802 obviously that is a lot slower than what you had in 2007
7465803 the reason being is global economic slowdown higher commodity prices and tightening of monetary policy on the part of the central bank
7465804 private consumption will remain in the drivers seat supported by robust remittances
7465805 domestic demand will emerge as the saviour of growth as external demand suffers due to global slowdown prospects and elevated commodity prices
7465806 we are in for a long battle as the floods have come in areas which are not prone to it
7465807 i felt bad it was tough but we were aiming to finish second and i did it
7465808 it was not easy for lewis but he did the job
7465809 again we suffered with a reliability problem this time on kimis car which lost us precious points
7465810 now we have to find out what happened in yet another engine failure and then decide how to react
7465811 clearly what happened is serious and we will have to do all in our power to make up for the ground we have lost through reliability problems in the coming races
7465812 the most positive element for us was that the boxes containing our spare parts were kept closed all weekend
7465813 we didnt need to fit a single replacement part throughout a race weekend that everyone thought would be full of crashes
7465814 now we can work hard for the final third of the season which begins with the back to back races at spa and monza two particularly challenging circuits that will put maximum stress on the engines
7465815 appeal for peace emergency preparedness and response in the wake of the escalating conflict in mindanao
7465816 it is with great concern that we witness the deteriorating humanitarian situation in various parts of mindanao as a result of the recent upsurge in conflict many civilians have lost their lives and many more are at risk
7465817 the agencies of the iasc who come together to coordinate relief efforts on behalf of the international community in times of crisis appeal for calm and protection of all civilians
7465818 an inter agency forum for coordination policy development and decision making involving un agencies and their non un humanitarian partners
7465819 so i say to the whole world there is no all out war what were doing were doing for all out peace in mindanao
7465820 we have never deviated from the objectives of the peace process but peace must be anchored on justice the rampage of lawless milf groups in mindanao calls for resolute military and police action the p10m revard for commanders kato and bravo manifests the governments firm resolve to hasten the neutralization of these criminals so that justice can be achieved the targeted lawless groups are historically the recalcitrant commands they will likely create problems even after a final agreement would be forged between the government and the milf the campaign against them is intended to remove the obstacles of the peace process

7465839 i saw things that hurt my head before i passed out
7465840 i i wasnt sure at first i thought i was just hallucinating but the more i thought about the things i saw the clearer they became
7465841 there was a bat it came out of nowhere and and just struck down on me
7465842 and there was this voice this voice of some guy one minute it was gentle the next it was full of anger
7465843 theres nothing wrong with you kame they were probably just hallucinations

7465846 hey nakazawa san i just got off the phone with kames parents
7465847 well its a long story i mean i guess it isnt since it can be considered a recent issue um well this is whats up
7465848 eri saw and heard some things before she passed out that day very violent things i think she was hallucinating but shes had nightmares about similar things in the past i tried asking her parents about it but they said theyve told me everything they knew
7465849 what really bugs me is what kind of bike accident would cause such a horrible head injury
7465850 hmm youve got a real dilemma on your hands huh
7465851 buuut the things that she saw could of happened to her and i might be way off here but maybe her parents are trying to hide it from you girls i mean what parent would want their child to remember such a brutal abusive past if that was past of course
7465852 why didnt i think of that but that would mean
7465853 i mean what if were wrong either way its horrible
7465854 do some research this is home town right someone around here must know about what happened to her
7465855 leave kamei chan with us im sure tanaka chan wouldnt mind looking after her
7465856 niigaki chan here offered to help me make some deliveries around town for the next few days in exchange for pay

7465863 youre wrong eri is happy the way she is she has niigaki san by her side there is no way knowing the past would make her happier

7465922 it might work to my advantage that so many players are out of the team
7465923 we have a lot of players out just now and when we are short of numbers you need to take your opportunities

7465958 people able to buy premium and super premium wines are clearly not as affected by the economy and are part of the reason that wines and alcoholic beverages in general are by and large resistant to economic downturns
7465959 at the same time even those who are economically better off are doing less on premise wine drinking with wine its very easy to replicate the experience of enjoying a good bottle in a restaurant at home and youre obviously going to pay considerably more for the same bottle in a restaurant spirits are a bit more resistant to downturns in on premise because its a bit harder to replicate the experience at home buying the ingredients mixing them and so forth takes more effort

7465974 i loved motherless brooklyn but after reading the fortress of solitude a book i consider a stone cold masterpiece i knew had to work with jonathan we carved out a couple days and met at his house in maine i hoped we would get a few things down and i was totally unprepared and completely blown away by the speed in which jonathan gets ideas on paper we would discuss the framework for a tune and he would be writing while we were talking then minutes later he would have several verses with internal rhymes a chorus and a bridge i was completely on the spot i now had to come up with melodies just as fast we ended up with eleven songs at the end of day two we decided that the project needed to be more than just an album of songs and over the next week jonathan emailed me several spoken word pieces i recorded these with just voice and the songs i recorded very bare bones just voice a single guitar and a simple drum beat
7465975 the second act in the construction of im not jim was our expansion from a collective of two into a collective of four its worth saying were not only
7465976 the elegant too took just my vocal tracks and built the thing from the ground up sometimes they used the same chords and beats i had played but more often they subverted the melodies and juxtaposed different chords and beats to create new combinations its a remix album without having an original release its an original re mix finally by another small world convergence jonathan is good buddies with one of my high school classmates i hadnt seen in years the painter kent matricardi so it was completely natural to enlist kent to do the album artwork

7466002 a large number of supporters of laxmanananda entered the district headquarter town of phulbani in violation of curfew restrictions on their way to chakapada and targeted churches and houses

7466011 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7466012 its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7466013 some people have said its as big a financial shock as the great depression and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal in the 1970s
7466014 there are periods when markets look like they are getting better then another grenade explodes another bout of fear of sustainability of some financial institutions maybe intervention by the authorities
7466015 tackling malnutrition should be a top priority for all nhs trusts
7466016 its shocking that many older people still find themselves trapped within a postcode lottery of commitment to improve nutritional standards on hospital wards
7466017 we know that good nutrition is central to peoples good health and ability to recover from illness which is why in october 2007 we launched the nutrition action plan in conjunction with over 25 leading stakeholders
7466018 this aims to outline how nutritional care and hydration can be improved amongst vulnerable adults in all health and social care settings
7466019 tampil trendi dengan rambut diwarnai akan terasa lebih nyaman bila warna itu disesuaikan dengan karakter seseorang karena itu kami meluncurkan tren baru dengan menyesuaikan warna rambut dan kepribadian masing masing orang
7466020 kami mengaplikasikan ide tersebut menjadi warna rambut dengan tiga pilihan warna yakni sexy cherry warna cokelat muda dari vintage cinnamon dan warna kuning dari sweet honey atau madu
7466021 kalau warna cokelat muda dari vintage cinnamon sangat cocok untuk seseorang yang tidak begitu berani bermain dengan warna warna rambut warna ini cocok dengan mereka yang berkarakter loyal ramah dan feminin
7466022 i bought this guide as a last resort i was just about to ship my xbox back to the factory when i found your guide thank you so much i had my xbox running in less than a half an hour
7466023 i was so mad when my xbox stopped working i was even more mad when i found out how much it was going to cost me to fix it my xbox had been sitting in the closet for the last 2 months when i found your guide halo 3 here i come
7466024 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7466025 he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7466026 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7466027 the good buy room has some great deals on gently used clothing the spring selection of wares are here and are very reasonably priced when you come into the main library in buckhorn next time go downstairs to the lower level and checkout the wonderful selection
7466028 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7466029 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7466030 i am happy with the game because we moved the ball around well and that allowed us to create more chances
7466031 we played with speed and a quickness that allowed us to really ask them some questions
7466032 on many occasions you can deserve something from a game and still not win
7466033 i am very happy to start this adventure with a goal
7466034 my inter teammates and the fans are fantastic i really must thank everyone
7466035 i am not sure that our campaign of signings has finished we have so many competitions
7466036 this referee must be a celtic fan i was marking mcmanus at the free kick and it was a clear hand ball i even asked mcmanus and he admitted he handled the ball into the net
7466037 he just ran in front of a crowd of players and scooped it in with his hand i couldnt believe it
7466038 i could have knocked the referee out to be honest
7466039 i am surprised i didnt get booked i booted the ball away and kept having a go at him it shows how inconsistent that referee is
7466040 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7466041 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7466042 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7466043 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7466044 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7466045 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7466046 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7466047 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7466048 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7466049 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7466050 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7466051 he comes from a middle class background went to school on scholarships
7466052 military technical cooperation will see a steady increase in arms sales of 8 10 annually over the next three to four years this is the potential set out in the defense contracts portfolio and the industry potential
7466053 employs not only highly qualified managers experienced in arms sales but who have first hand knowledge of weapons production
7466054 alex hleb and mathieu flamini are two of my best friends in football and i wish them all the best i speak to them every week and i know how they feel i am not going to tell you but arsenal is arsenal
7466055 this club has something special that no others have we have to take care of it
7466056 i have a lot of friends in spain and italy and when they speak about other clubs i know i am privileged to be where i am i dont want to lose it i want to win things for the club i want to get experience here i want to play for arsenal
7466057 our goal with the design of the cruze was to be bold not evolutionary
7466058 we wanted to take a big step forward making a strong design statement for chevrolet products around the world
7466059 keine anhaltspunkte f r wahlfehler ergeben die f r den ausgang der landtagswahl erheblich gewesen sind
7466060 die lediglich abstrakte m glichkeit von wahlmanipulationen die prinzipiell nicht ausgeschlossen werden kann ist nicht geeignet die erheblichkeit eines wahlfehlers f r den ausgang der wahl zu begr nden

7466067 mir erscheint diese interpretation etwas einseitig er miller scheint sich auf den sex und die gewalt zu konzentrieren diese elemente kamen zwar in vielen der geschichten vor aber ich glaube nicht dass es darum in der serie geht der comic war letztlich optimistisch egal was f r dreckige dinge dem spirit darin geschahen
7466068 you dont often notice or think about the qualities of a leader whats noticeable is how they make you feel
7466069 the athletes were never expected to carry the water for the activists it is a matter of individual conscience
7466070 ultimately it is more of an indictment of the atmosphere of intimidation and censorship imposed by the chinese government not to mention the confusing messages
7466071 softball 2016 but no headbands for darfur no tibetan flags
7466072 id suspect a major reason for this is that olympic athletes see the games as a once in lifetime opportunity to shine in their sport stand out and possibly cash in
7466073 its a moment that theyve been training and preparing for all their lives and to risk tarnishing all their hard work with a protest or political statement just isnt worth it

7466076 companies would have to pay more for so called emissions permits created as part of the european unions carbon trading scheme under the plan being studied by treasury officials the times has learnt initially the permits were free but ministers announced proposals recently to auction 7 per cent of them a measure that could raise 2 billion over four years the latest plan would increase that figure to 10 per cent bringing in a further 500 million the money would help to fund a package of help for food fuel and housing costs for poorer households expected to form the centrepiece of mr browns efforts to restore his political fortunes this autumn

7466085 we welcome the idea that officers who are injured in the execution of their duty receive more payments
7466086 the consultation paper obfuscates what the real case is here it confuses the injury award system with the pensions i suspect the whole thing is purely about saving the government money
7466087 i am committed to ensuring we have an injury compensation system suitable for the challenges of modern day policing which recognises the demanding and sometimes dangerous roles that police officers carry out
7466088 i hope the changes will provide peace of mind and assurances to police officers and their families while ensuring the system is as effective as possible administered consistently and targets help where it is needed most
7466089 it is like compacting your entire wardrobe into a shoebox
7466090 what takes care of neutralizing dna to allow chromosomes to condense
7466091 did dinoflagellates once have histones and then lost them or did dinoflagellates never have histones and just figured out a different way to fold large amounts of dna into chromosomes
7466092 chromosomes would fall apart when calcium and magnesium were removed
7466093 cations play a very important role in the folding and charge neutralization of dna in all eukaryotes but more so in dinoflagellates
7466094 i find it truly amazing that in all other eukaryotes histones help in this charge neutralization and dinoflagellates constitute the only exception to this nearly universal rule it looks like this may have been the first and very efficient step toward the goal of neutralizing dna long before histones came into play
7466095 we need to be realistic about what we can and cant do with hydrogen right now
7466096 in addition to some of the more buck rogers things that might happen in the future we need to study some of the things we can do in the short term

7466098 wir m chten die materialien auch in der f rdertechnik anwenden der unterschied zum klassischen faserseil besteht darin dass die seile nicht nur hohe statische belastungen ertragen sondern kontinuierlich gebogen und umgelenkt werden
7466099 wir verwenden vor allem materialien wie dyneema vectran und technora das sind hochmodulare faserwerkstoffe mit gestreckten molek lketten die nach dem strecken thermisch fixiert werden diese sind teilweise deutlich fester als stahl und haben viele positive eigenschaften
7466100 mit der entwicklung hochmodularer faserwerkstoffe ende des 20 jahrhunderts er ffneten sich viele neue anwendungsm glichkeiten denen jedoch aufgrund des neuheitsgrades ein gro es forschungsdefizit gegen bersteht deshalb gibt es keine geeignete pr ftechnik zu kaufen so dass wir das meiste selber konstruieren mussten und auch kaum auf erfahrungswerte zur ckgreifen konnten
7466101 nur wenn wir selber seile produzieren wissen wir genau was wir untersuchen au erdem werden f r tests nur kurze seilst cke ben tigt jedoch produziert uns kein unternehmen nur 50 meter eines seiles
7466102 mit dieser ausstattung k nnen wir alle wesentlichen eigenschaften von faserseilen untersuchen
7466103 die seile sind schon mal mehrere wochen im pr fstand bis sich etwas zeigt aber der durchlauf hinsichtlich materialverbrauch und zeit ist sehr gut optimiert
7466104 die bisherigen ergebnisse zeigen dass die seile so wie sie jetzt sind nur wenig f r den einsatz in der f rdertechnik geeignet sind trotzdem stimmen uns die ergebnisse optimistischer als wir es erwartet h tten denn es muss bedacht werden dass die materialien aus einem ganz anderen einsatzgebiet kommen mit der richtigen modifizierung haben sie ein gro es potenzial f r unsere anwendungen
7466105 in einem ersten anwendungsbezogenen projekt arbeiten wir beispielsweise an einer gewichtsreduzierten seilwinde f r hubschrauber au erdem planen wir in kooperation mit einem anderen unternehmen faserseile in krananlagen zu testen

7466107 dna chips have revolutionised biological and medical science for many years scientists have tried to develop similar protein chips but technical difficulties associated with attaching large numbers of proteins to surfaces have prevented their widespread application
7466108 the method we have developed could have profound applications in the diagnosis of disease screening of new drugs and in the detection of bacteria pollutants toxins and other molecules

7466125 i went after him because he was the only one who could beat me
7466126 i feel sorry for him but there can only be one winner it is just sport and you have to do what you have to do
7466127 certain aspects of these games have been disturbing for me most notably the heavy crackdown on any kind of dissent in beijing many of the judging decisions in favour of the home competitors and also some of the negative sniping and whinging towards some of our successes that has gone on here
7466128 i suspect theyre china going to dominate future olympics in a way that will somewhat lessen everyone elses enthusiasm for them which will be a shame
7466129 at the end of the day in the events that count china was almost invisible won the games hardly

7466142 i had to discharge the jury because some jurors disobeyed my instructions and misconducted themselves
7466143 at some considerable public expense and inconvenience to a lot of people i had to stop the trial
7466144 its possible that every member of this jury panel will have heard about read about or seen some report or comment about this case over the past few years
7466145 the court is anxious to ensure that every juror who tries this case can be completely impartial
7466146 you are absolutely forbidden to make your own inquiries about this trial

7466148 hey guys who visited summer comike from far away lets talk about recommended doujinshi of this summer with me
7466149 i saw a wall of ice coming towards us and then we were carried 200 metres
7466150 there was absolutely no noise it was very disturbing we only had time to swerve to the right before being mowed down
7466151 if the snow melts and this might not happen because were close to the end of the summer its possible that the bodies will come to the surface if that happens well go and get them
7466152 it was a very very fine morning i went outside to see what the weather was like and i saw a line of lights moving up the mountain
7466153 i put on my harness i was ready to go i looked again and i asked myself am i dreaming then i understood
7466154 when i say scene from the apocalypse its because there were a lot of injured it was cold it was dark it was stressful
7466155 we found the first casualty who had a broken leg and after that we found a guide who had three broken vertebrae people with hypothermia people in panic people who had been through something horrific

7466173 st ndig entstehen neuartige methoden zur gewinnung neuer stammzelllinien in der kulturschale die wir f r forschung und therapie ja dringend brauchen
7466174 bisher konnten wir nur im tierversuch herausfinden wie potent die einzelnen linien sind unsere neuen instrumente methoden aus der k nstlichen intelligenz forschung und das plurinet geben uns nun die m glichkeit mittels computergest tzter modelle die f higkeiten der zellen zu erkunden
7466175 am meisten berraschte es uns dass unterschiedliche pluripotente stammzellen zu denen auch die so genannten und in deutschland kontrovers diskutierten embryonalen stammzellen geh ren untereinander sehr hnlich sind w hrend andere stammzelltypen wie z b die stammzellen die aus gehirngewebe gewonnen werden k nnen voneinander sehr verschieden sind
7466176 mit dem blichen reduktionistischen ansatz der sich auf die untersuchung und den vergleich von details konzentriert k me man irgendwann nicht mehr weiter
7466177 in unserem fach sind wir es gewohnt mit komplexen systemen wie dem menschlichen verhalten umzugehen das hat auch den ansatz dieses projekts gepr gt und dazu gef hrt dass man sich das system an sich vorgenommen hat um ein gesamtbild zu erhalten f r mich ist dieses gesamtbild die eigentliche sensation der arbeit weil dies ganz neue aufschl sse liefert
7466178 wir haben uns daf r entschieden alles als open source und mit verkn pfungen zum weltweit freien online lexikon wikipedia bereit zu stellen
7466179 weil wir uns dadurch einen ansto f r die internationale forschung erhoffen je schneller die erkenntnisse international aufgenommen und reflektiert werden desto eher werden wir mit stammzellen erfolgreich und sicher patienten behandeln k nnen

7466200 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
7466201 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
7466202 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines

7466285 the penalty save changed the atmosphere in the ground and put an extra yard in the step of the newcastle players and we were rocking for four or five minutes
7466286 we saw that off and the defending from the corner that got the goal was fine but it was the second phase of that we didnt do well enough we should be either catching michael owen offside or should be picking him up
7466287 he is one of the best strikers in the world
7466288 i am still very positive because the fact is we have been beaten in the last minute of the game
7466289 over the whole period i thought we should have got at least something from the game after we scored two very good goals
7466290 it is too early to start cutting up players as it were we have played two games in the premier league and weve scored six goals
7466291 so scoring doesnt seem to be our problem at the moment
7466292 i wouldnt be out here if i wasnt 100 but like anything you cant have the illness that ive had and then just go and train and then after two minutes go and play straight away
7466293 you need to almost harden your body like last season when the manager took over i played all 20 games under his reign and there wasnt even an ounce of a problem because your body gets hardened to playing
7466294 the whole kennedy family will be in a special section it should be quite a moment
7466295 today it is clear that after georgias aggression against south ossetia that georgian south ossetian and georgian abkhazian relations cannot be returned to their former state
7466296 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to get independence
7466297 we will look today at the appeals from the peoples of abkhazia and south ossetia to recognise the independence of these republics i think that all these decisions will be accepted
7466298 getting a ceasefire stopping hostilities and the troop withdrawal in eight days thats quite a lot already well have to see we have to take stock of the situation
7466299 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7466300 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7466301 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7466302 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7466303 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7466304 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig
7466305 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7466306 the industry has taken much greater strides than anyone ever imagined 40 years ago
7466307 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
7466308 their the cdcs ability to say that theyre going to have ongoing reliable reports of incidence is somewhat questionable unless you have funding for that
7466309 has seriously degraded cms ability to meet its responsibilities in combating fraud and abuse
7466310 the company has performed well during difficult conditions and is strongly positioned with an excellent product range
7466311 we are pleased with the progress at our melbourne projects development is under way and we anticipate receiving significant income from these projects in fy2009
7466312 while we recognise a number of factors have increased buyer uncertainty the prospect for future revenue growth from both western australia and victoria remains strong
7466313 i cant remember having seen such a good humorous non sense series linked to politics
7466314 the liberals control the ultimate passage of this through the senate so the question of economic responsibility goes fair and squarely back to them
7466315 he will do the right thing there and we will participate in all negotiations
7466316 in three of those four were awaiting senate inquiry outcomes thats the sensible thing to do
7466317 the governments got its budget and it wants to get it through in the main

7466325 each barangay will be authorized to deputize five police auxiliaries who will be under the strict supervision of the philippine national police
7466326 i see the dollar in a near term consolidation phase technically the market has already sharply increased dollar longs and concerns over the gses government sponsored enterprises are streaming back
7466327 we do think that growth concerns will keep currencies under pressure especially in the pro cyclical open economies including the singapore dollar and the malaysian ringgit and also where fundamentals are weak such as the indian rupiah and south korean won
7466328 the dollar strength across the board and the anwar issue is pushing the ringgit weaker
7466329 our us dollar singapore dollar forecasts are now at 1 40 1 40 and 1 45 on 3 6 and 12 month horizons
7466330 i think prices rose because of a technical rebound some market participants are obviously seeing buying opportunities after fridays sharp fall

7466334 the coa reportedly discovered that medicines the department of budget and managements dbm procurement service had purchased for central visayas using the pork barrel of an unidentified former senator were overpriced by p15 46 billion
7466335 it was noted that the price was eight times higher than of those procured by the department of health doh from the same manufacturer and distributor pitc pharma inc
7466336 recurring reports of government hospitals allegedly keeping millions of pesos worth of surplus and expired medicines
7466337 excessive and unnecessary and or expired or about to expire medicines
7466338 surrender is a simple criterion for a ceasefire because if you do not take a position against these kinds of crimes these murders and massacres against innocent civilians you cannot claim to be a part of these talks
7466339 yun ang pinakauna nilang gawin na hakbang surrender kato and macapaar para maniwala ang ating pamahalaan na ang milf central committee ay naniniwala pa rin sa usapang pangkapayapaan that is the first step they should take to convince our government that the milf central committee still believes in peace talks
7466340 we are absolutely not pressured by milf i think the criminal elements of the milf are the ones being pressured they are running all over the place like scared rats
7466341 president musevenis leadership has become like a rotating town service taxi with a handful of people inside and yet nobody is willing to come out
7466342 museveni should stop thinking that there are no ugandans who can lead this country and that without him the country will fall apart the struggle should begin now we want new people to run the taxi
7466343 to deepen democracy and stability within the party there is a need to dispel the idea that it is only museveni who can lead this country
7466344 the few people in this rotating taxi should not stifle undermine or tactically eliminate others that is why i am going to test musevenis democratic credentials
7466345 mr ogong is wasting time he is free to stand but the party delegates conference will elect our flag bearer if ogong convinces the delegates to elect him well and good nrm is a democratic party
7466346 they did their part but the country must move forward with or without them
7466347 these people calling themselves nrm historicals should know that in the process many people from different walks of life joined the movement and it is now for all ugandans
7466348 the price of the crude in the world market has been reduced greatly but oil firms have responded with small rollbacks the arroyo government has also been playing deaf to reasonable call by workers and the country for a p125 legislated wage increase and the removal of vat on oil products and power
7466349 i never had problem with him we have always worked together and i think his tour was a reunion of teso with him
7466350 we have considerable growth plans for each sector of the group plantations health care packaging and travel
7466351 the funds will be used to settle short term and high cost debt to enable the company to invest in the long term
7466352 we invest in good companies with good potential that have reached a certain level with capital from the founders and debt but are still not strong enough to go to the next level
7466353 so private equity funds like aureos fill that gap by taking risks that market participants may not like to take and take the company to the next level from local to the regional level and from the regional level to the global level
7466354 we made significant improvements in operations in plantations and healthcare high tea rubber and palm oil prices and growth in our branded business also helped
7466355 metal packaging is now the accepted green face of packaging
7466356 there is no need for the pml n to be part of the coalition government if one party is taking decisions unilaterally
7466357 there are babies whove been born and are now walking and talking since we started this campaign

7466369 we are definitely disappointed by australia because they have not toured us for 10 years naghmi said
7466370 australia have a commitment of playing five one day internationals in april next year so we hope by then their fears are removed and they play in our country said naghmi of australia who have not toured pakistan since 1998

7466376 i feel were probably one of the teams and i think theyre all about the same really between fourth and twelfth we could have finished anywhere up to fourth matthews said
7466377 were going to finish tenth or eleventh so therefore thats a failure
7466378 weve failed to end up where i think were capable of doing
7466379 we had seven games that have been decided by less than two goals and we lost three and won four matthews said
7466380 theyre the ones you tend to think if youre in front with a few minutes to go thats where you feel like you should be able to now protect the lead for a few minutes
7466381 one of the things that you always do at the end of the season and players should as well is ask how many players had career best years or how many players played as well as they have before
7466382 over the whole season there would be more that would look back and say no i didnt have a great year
7466383 some might say i had a poor year some might say i had an okay year but there would only be a handful that probably have felt yeah this is my best year that ive had in my footy career
7466384 i feel like weve got more upside in our players than weve got logical downsides so i still think were on the up he said

7466391 one of the most powerful pamphlets ever written in australia
7466392 racism and the highly evolved strategies that some white australians use to dismiss obstruct and trivialise aboriginal people are like a virus just when you think you have inoculated yourself against it another version of the attack hits you when you are unprepared
7466393 i just cant forget what he did to me its rushing back to me these memories

7466404 cargado con unos 8 mil pies de madera lo paramos y le consultamos al chofer de donde ven a la madera y nos dijo que no era de l que estaba haciendo un flete para el aserradero fueguino le pedimos la documentaci n necesaria para hacer ese movimiento de madera y no ten a nada

7466427 mit hansi lang verliert wien einen gro en musiker und k nstler der die geschichte der wiener popmusik ma geblich mitgepr gt und ein bedeutender vertreter der wiener kulturszene in den letzen drei jahrzehnten war
7466428 er war eine poplegende mit ecken und kanten mit widerspr chen und selbstzweifeln das zeichnete ihn aus und verband ihn mit seinem publikum er war authentisch origin r unverwechselbar und vielseitig hansi lang hat sich nie dem mainstream angebiedert und f hrte ein leben ohne k nstlerische kompromisse in dem er immer wieder neuland betreten hat wie etwa zuletzt mit dem slow club aber auch mit der vertonung von h c artmann texten hans lang wird wien sehr abgehen
7466429 durch das versagen von verkehrsminister faymann steuert sterreich auf einen verkehrskollaps zu die hohen lpreise machen das autofahren f r die menschen zum kaum mehr leistbaren luxus immer mehr feinstaub klimagase und l rm belasten die gesundheit der sterreicherinnen enorm
7466430 viele menschen wollen umsteigen haben jedoch auf grund fehlender ffentlicher verkehrsmittel keine chance
7466431 durch diese ffi milliarde wollen wir bus oder bahn in jedes dorf bringen
7466432 das bringt ca 420 mio euro mehreinnahmen pro jahr und schiebt dem lkw transit einen riegel vor
7466433 verkehrsminister faymann will in den kommenden jahren milliarden in den ausbau von autobahnen und schnellstra en pumpen und setzt damit die falschen priorit ten selbst der rechnungshof hat monsterprojekte wie die lobauautobahn in frage gestellt
7466434 der lpreis wird weiter steigen und erd l zunehmend knapp innerhalb der n chsten f nf jahre m ssen daher leistungsf hige und leistbare ffentliche verkehrsmittel f r alle sterreicherinnen zur verf gung stehen neue autobahnen helfen nichts

7466437 durch seinen tod hat sterreich einen k nstler verloren der mehr war als ein interpret
7466438 in der beschaulichkeit des sterreichischen kulturlebens hat hansi lang einen kontrapunkt gesetzt der aus heutiger sicht in seiner radikalit t kaum noch nachvollziehbar ist kultur fasst er als bewusste rebellion auf die sich durch alle bereiche seiner musik den texten der pers nlichen stilisierung aber auch lebensf hrung niederschlug hansi lang kopierte aber nicht nur internationale entwicklungen er versuchte sie mit den spezifischen sterreichischen erfahrungen zusammenzuf hren daraus entstand eine genuine sterreichische variante der popul rkultur die mit seinem namen untrennbar in verbindung bleibt unbestreitbar sind seine k nstlerischen und vielf ltigen sozialen leistungen f r die ihn ein breites publikum sch tzte durch seinen tod hat sterreich einen k nstler verloren der mehr war als ein interpret hansi lang war ein meister seiner f cher und einer der kult und kultur zu verbinden verstand

7466440 der st dtebund begr t die tatsache dass das bmi eine initiative zur information der bev lkerung startet
7466441 allerdings konterkariert diese initiative die behutsame informationsarbeit der wahldurchf hrenden kommunen da die bmi initiative mehr verwirrung stiftet wird als sie zur information der bev lkerung beitragen kann
7466442 so oder so muss die kommune schriftlich oder m ndlich dem nicht wahlberechtigten ausl ndischen oder minderj hrigen antragsteller die unangenehme nachricht bermitteln dass trotz information des bmi mangels vorliegender voraussetzungen keine wahlkarte ausgestellt werden kann
7466443 sterreichs kommunen haben eine langj hrige erfahrung mit der durchf hrung aller arten von wahlen und begr en nat rlich die initiative des bmi die bev lkerung ber die bevorstehende nationalratswahl zu informieren allerdings w re es besser gewesen wenn das bmi im zuge der planung der initiative das know how der kommunen und deren interessensvertretungen genutzt h tte

7466458 even in mainland china premier wen jiabao is very successful in delivering his image in a sympathetic way to the marginal or grass root groups of the chinese society
7466459 the message the premier has been delivering to the population is that he represents a new value in which he is on the side of the marginal groups who cannot benefit from the economic development process
7466460 as only a small circle of people can determine who can be the candidates running for a chief executive election its not about the dissatisfaction of the general public but that of the small group of people
7466461 but still politicians need to build up a positive reputation and care about public sentiment as no one wants to have another tung chee hwa who was overturned by half a million hong kong people on the streets
7466462 of course its a bad spin a good spin is only to let people comprehend complicated political messages easier rather than to distort a politicians image

7466503 ich sehe nicht den geringsten grund das konkordat und das bewaehrte verh ltnis zwischen staat und kirche in bayern in frage zu stellen

7466506 we wanted good screens and number of shows for hijack there was no point giving it a scant release since hijack is a big film which deserves wider audience
7466507 due to september seeing shraddh period majority of films are making a beeline to arrive in august itself good for them however i dont see any reason why hijack should come in a week with 4 5 other films just last week there were 4 movies phoonk mumbai meri jaan maan gaye mughall e azam and my friend ganesha 2 this weekend we again have four movies arriving c kkompany chamku rock on and perhaps mukhbiir sorry but i am in love with my film i would rather bring it on when it stands up on its own rather than be a face in the crowd even if that means that we all would have to wait for a week longer
7466508 nahi not at all after all i have nurtured this film and ensured that each and every frame carries the kind of finesse as we see in hollywood films this is an action film with quite some grandeur to boast of what difference does a few days make

7466513 we chose a punjabi couple because they are usually outspoken their excitement is wider and they are so colourful i knew aamir would play it best

7466548 it actually took us a really long time to write 17 pages
7466549 but we had never done a film before and we had a story to tell and we both wanted a challenge in our lives as we approached a certain age
7466550 but filming it is another thing and we didnt realize wed set ourselves a monumental challenge its funny though when we started to tell people wed actually written this film a comedy about grief some people looked alarmed i guess because theyre afraid of a grief thats too terrible to laugh at but most of the women we spoke to had a look of instant recognition on their face their response was just to burst into laughter that was really interesting
7466551 the moments when the penny drops when a decision is made when something becomes clear or maybe a little too clear
7466552 these people are all doing something new for the first time theyre all slightly nervous but it was wonderful watching people take those leaps of faith
7466553 it was inspiring to watch people learning from others ultimately we hope this project inspires other people of any age to try something new
7466554 our little film how are you is really a film full of recognizable moments and when we were making it we kept hearing from people like our producer sonya di rienzo flamenco at 5 15 or the sound person or someone in makeup or hair who said they would love to make a film about a pivotal life changing moment and we started to think wouldnt it be a great idea for all these people to work on individual films and then parcel them together in a mosaic that reflects real life moments of enlightenment amongst the filmmakers
7466555 the difficulty of short films of course is that the ramp up is so huge for three days of filming
7466556 to get a whole film crew together and raise the money the idea here is to pool our resources and be able to film the shorts over two weeks using the same director of photography david franco and the same crew so it seems like a smart idea actually just the process of filling out applications is so daunting for some people the producers in our group are able to help with that it just helps people get up to speed much faster
7466557 they say everyone has a novel in them but not many people have time to write a novel
7466558 but i actually think everyone has a short film in them making it however is a very difficult discipline to narrow it down to 10 minutes or three has its own challenges this is an opportunity to really get this kind of experience in microcosm
7466559 how are you evolved out of conversations we shared with each other our friends and acquaintances we decided to take the leap into unknown territory for the simple reason weve reached an age and point in our lives when we needed a new challenge
7466560 this film is about a certain kind of grief that we all have to deal with at a certain age
7466561 when youre in your 20s you think wow thats not going to happen to me but then we reach a certain age maybe its your 30s or your 40s when you realize oh im part of that too grief is now part of my story so how are you is about a turning point where you have to figure out how to go forward from here

7466589 the up side is that by eliminating the loss limits we hope to make it up
7466590 were the only state in the u s that has such a limit its a competition issue
7466591 theres a lot of legislators who view it as the last part of our original gaming laws and they just dont want to move away from that
7466592 the main purpose of the council is to give consumers a voice in the program
7466593 it makes sense that he will campaign in the battlegrounds where people are most familiar with him

7466598 many participants said they initially supported the death penalty mostly because of information they received from the mass media
7466599 many participants were convinced that the continued presence of the death penalty in national legislation was a deterrent they had not considered the opposite view that crimes were committed by people who were not thinking of the sentence at the time and were convinced they would escape justice
7466600 many said the death penalty gave them a sense of security they had not thought that street lighting everywhere and effective policing would give them this
7466601 it is the authorities who are deliberately prolonging the road to abolition
7466602 i know there is not just one argument in support of abolition i tried in my essay to give many reasons for my opposition to capital punishment
7466603 our country has reached a crucial moment in its history we have to make a good choice now we have to respect human rights and the dignity and value of human life
7466604 nevertheless we must not be ruled by our emotions and allow ourselves to administer this ultimate punishment
7466605 for crimes to be kept to the barest minimum it is important to guarantee employment and raise living standards in our society
7466606 i dont think thats something that can go away in six days
7466607 a lot depends on how we are treated at the convention and how hillary and bill are received at the convention
7466608 many rank and file democrats including myself who feel that our party leadership has failed us
7466609 the wounds are pretty deep so itll take a lot more than bandages
7466610 i think that what youre going to see is something very similar to what happened in 1960 going into the convention when president john f kennedy won
7466611 the enthusiasm came for him after he won the nomination and started telling people what he really believed and what he was going to do
7466612 he was so charismatic that the country fell in love with him i think theyll do the same thing with sen obama
7466613 this convention will have a great deal of excitement because of the number of young people who got involved in the obama campaign and the number of women who got engaged because of clintons candidacy
7466614 we have to project an image of unity and enthusiasm behind our nominee
7466615 secondly weve got to clarify our message as democrats and that message in a state like kentucky has to revolve around the economy
7466616 the opinion of the security forces is that the risk resulting from their release is low
7466617 the israeli government is making a big mistake by releasing now terrorists now with blood on their hands the first time for many years
7466618 and the lesson to the region is that terror pay s off
7466619 you are now putting him in a situation that he is the same like hamas both of them want terrorists back in the yard
7466620 these 200 it takes israel one week to 10 days to re arrest them
7466621 can in fact deliver much more for their own people than the extremists than the terrorists ever can
7466622 its a serious problem because as of now roughly 300 000 people have come out of bajaur and many of them who were living with relatives are now shifting to camps
7466623 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7466624 he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7466625 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7466626 el problema es el patriarcado la sociedad dominada por los hombres
7466627 tirar al beb con el agua de la ba era
7466628 mientras no me retraje de decirles ninguna de las cosas que fueran de provecho ni de ense arles p blicamente y de casa en casa
7466629 y estas buenas nuevas del reino se predicar n en toda la tierra habitada para testimonio a todas las naciones y entonces vendr el fin
7466630 its almost like youre writing a book one post at a time
7466631 australia have a commitment of playing five one day internationals in april next year so we hope by then their fears are removed and they play in our country
7466632 we are definitely disappointed by australia because they have not toured us for 10 years
7466633 thats like leaving the tap running and pouring 40 trillion litres of water into the garbage can enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
7466634 i was very surprised with the high numbers but it catches everybodys attention
7466635 so there is a distribution problem but this also reflects the maldistribution of water
7466636 curbing these losses and improving water productivity provides win win opportunities for farmers business ecosystems and the global hungry
7466637 the information is clearly presented current and easy to read the book contains information not available in other texts of this type and would be a valuable addition to any personal or institutional library
7466638 this book is very well written and reflects the enthusiasm of the distinguished authors for the subject matter the text is directed primarily at veterinary students and is entirely appropriate for this readership this reviewer has regularly recommended the previous edition to veterinary undergraduates at the ontario veterinary college and will continue to recommend the second edition
7466639 veterinary virology is a well worked text coming as close as any available to the task of reconciling the enormous advances in basic virology with the needs of those interested in the associated animal diseases
7466640 rahman is partially paralysed by the impact of the fall which has resulted in gradual wasting of his right lower limbs he cannot stand for more than three to four minutes because of the acute pain due to the compression fracture he has been on pain killers ever since he was admitted to the hospital in january
7466641 this is my fourth tour i went to almost every single show the last time round but i hadnt seen any of this one before tonight i loved it it is a great show
7466642 i love all her dark songs best some of the songs come from genuine suffering let me tell you
7466643 its quite an experience being on tour with the missus in america you get full on motorcades and 15 car escorts from the police
7466644 in london youre lucky if you get one rozzer its something else on show night there will be 20 levels of staff before you get through to see the missus
7466645 thats one thing about the missuss shows they are non stop
7466646 you get in shes on and then you have two hours of non stop entertainment
7466647 it seems to me this is what we are a constant renewal
7466648 anything to be cutting edge whether we can keep doing it remains to be seen ever since ive been here people have been saying its overbuilt
7466649 not to the best of my recollection but there is material being gathered by the department about the child concerned so there may well be something that i dont recall but as youll appreciate it is a long time ago
7466650 i think it would be wrong of me because its very complex human issues that are involved in this
7466651 this is about a child and an adoptive family thats gone out of its way and done their best to give a child a new life and to make a family equally there are birth parents who have equally suffered so the ultimate outcome here is one that i dont think any of us can know yet
7466652 the nepali government and people are striving for national stability and economic development and hoped to get support and cooperation from china
7466653 it may sound odd but the humanity of the taliban because they are a wide very diverse group of people
7466654 some would like to talk to the british government some of them dont want to be fighting british troops some of them would this is the ideological taliban
7466655 you knew the bombs were dropping and the guns were pointing in that direction but you never got a sense of how afghans are as a people
7466656 comments like this can only add hugely to the grief of relatives of the fallen
7466657 my eyes suffer terribly every time i chop onions i look like a scot coming out of murrayfield after a beating by england ive tried all of the old wives tales to no effect if they have finally nailed the problem with this invention i would be very impressed
7466658 i would love to see my customers faces though if they were greeted at the door by a madman in a huge pair of goggles
7466659 strong onions do make your eyes run even when youre used to them but i think id get a few laughs if i turned up to work wearing goggles im not sure theyre something that will take off in professional kitchens
7466660 if you switch on american tv you see all these gadgets most of them would be no use at all there are certain things which are actually a great help such as a machine we have to take the zest of citrus fruit and it saves us a lot of time but most of the things on the market are useless
7466661 we do sell a metal bar which helps people get the smell of onions off their hands and that is very popular so i think the goggles would be too
7466662 chinese authorities informed us last night that the eight individuals detained august 20 and 21 respectively were deported by chinese authorities
7466663 i once had the degree of my deviated septum operated on since then i can breathe much better and sleep nights like a baby
7466664 the rest of my body is all mine and absolutely natural and its going to stay that way i am very satisfied with what god gave me
7466665 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton rather than joe biden as the running mate for barack obama
7466666 its kind of a no brainer that thats your ticket
7466667 a friend of mine and i have great respect for him
7466668 his health has suffered during the three years he has been in prison here
7466669 he needs urgent medical attention otherwise he may barely last the next six months he thinks he has a maximum of six months to live
7466670 from what we have heard from people in britain they will think that is a good thing
7466671 my mom is a romantic person and i think i inherited that from her there are all different types of romance the romance you share with a partner but theres also the thoughtfulness you have with your children that can be romantic
7466672 then there is remembering what people like and what they appreciate and wanting them to experience it thats romantic to me
7466673 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar
7466674 warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
7466675 since the case is sub judice we cant comment as of now
7466676 however we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release
7466677 when i came here i could not decide what to do and it was a trying situation my mother has expired i came here to perform the last rites but when i saw this flooding i thought i should find out another place but then realized that floodwaters would be everywhere the government needs to look into this
7466678 i had to get the logs to the platform it was so difficult to reach the platform carrying the logs in knee deep waters
7466679 itu adalah keputusan saya tidak memainkannya dia tetap dimasukkan ke dalam susunan pemain karena kami butuh melihat apa yang akan terjadi kami berharap dia akan tetap bersama kami musim selanjutnya
7466680 there were around 400 fpi members we akkbb gathered at the monas open area

7466690 russia has long been told to simply accept the facts heres the independence of kosovo for you heres the abrogation of the antiballistic missile treaty and the american decision to place missile defenses in neighboring countries heres the unending expansion of nato all of these moves have been set against the backdrop of sweet talk about partnership why would anyone put up with such a charade
7466691 has been far from fair and balanced especially during the first days of the crisis
7466692 clearly wanted to make sure that whatever the outcome russia would be blamed for worsening the situation the west then mounted a propaganda attack against russia with the american news media leading the way
7466693 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
7466694 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7466695 the vice presidency is not worth a bucket of warm spit
7466696 it just seems like nobody wants to be vice president
7466697 i dont intend to spend the next four years counting the buttons on another mans coat tails
7466698 i can still hear roosevelts guffaw when he was told the speakers opinion of the office
7466699 tugwell undoubtedly believed the remark could be attributed to garner as he described the veteran politician as
7466700 im deaf blind and dumb as far as politics is concerned im like a soldier i do as im told but since the day i was elected vice president ive said nothing
7466701 our firm has two members the senior member does all the talking and i do all the work
7466702 you dont have to remove any rind to get at the meat of what he says
7466703 a number of gleeful disrespectful unprintable but endearing epithets couched in the rich vernacular of the southwest
7466704 there cannot be a great vice president a great man may occupy the office but there is no way for him to become a great vice president because the office in itself is almost wholly unimportant
7466705 when i was elected vice president of he united states it was the worst thing that ever happened to me
7466706 a no mans land somewhere between the legislative and executive branch
7466707 vice president has no arsenal from which to draw power
7466708 ill tell you lyndon the vice presidency isnt worth a pitcher of warm spit
7466709 the vice presidency isnt worth a pitcher of warm spit
7466710 the vice presidency john nance garner once confided to fellow texan lyndon johnson isnt worth a pitcher of warm spit
7466711 whites popular book on the 1960 presidential election undoubtedly helped circulate the bucket episode to a national audience
7466712 worst damn fool mistake i ever made was letting myself be elected vice president of the united states
7466713 when i switched from speaker to vice president it was the only demotion i ever had
7466714 i am vice president of the united states youd better stick around a while you might pick up some new ideas
7466715 plain spoken to the last he always regretted having given up his speakers role for the vice presidency which he said wasnt worth a pitcher of warm spit
7466716 those pantywaist writers wouldnt print it the way i said it
7466717 barack has a handicap the other candidates dont have barack obama has a black wife and i dont think a black woman can be first lady of the united states yeah i said it a black woman can be president no problem first lady cant do it you know why because a black woman cannot play the background of a relationship just imagine telling your black wife that youre president honey i did it i won im the president no we the president and i want my girlfriends in the cabinet i want kiki to be secretary of state she can fight
7466718 there are some who think it will be harder for america to accept a black first lady than a black male president
7466719 sometimes it seems that many americans fear a black first lady more than a merely half white president
7466720 i am the son of a black man from kenya and a white woman from kansas
7466721 i am married to a black american who carries within her the blood of slaves and slave owners an inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters
7466722 in america the enslaved african woman became the basis for our societys other
7466723 gender is probably the most restricting force in american life whether the question is who must be in the kitchen or who could be in the white house
7466724 the combined discrimination of being 1 black 2 female and 3 poor may be greater than the sum of each of the three parts
7466725 un deserving of the courtesy and esteem automatically bestowed on white women
7466726 polarized woman into the clustering of images goodness and light with virginity and evil and darkness with sexuality
7466727 reified and confirmed when white planters owned black slave women
7466728 for as perpetuator of white superiority legitimate line and as a creature absolutely inaccessible to the males of the inferior group she inevitably became the focal center of the fundamental pattern of proto dorian pride
7466729 it was no accident that the most articulate spokesmen for slavery were also eloquent exponents of the subordinate role of women
7466730 nevertheless white southern women internalized the mythology of the southern feminine mystique and reveled in the power it granted them over their black subordinates both male and female
7466731 just as the cult of white womanhood in the south served to preserve a labor and social system based on race distinctions so did the cult of the lady in an egalitarian society serve as a means of preserving class distinctions
7466732 the women of the newly middle and upper classes could use their newly gained time for leisure pursuits they became ladies
7466733 a more welcome resource to some thousands of young women unwilling to give themselves to domestic service
7466734 they organized black ladies literary intelligence temperance and moral improvement societies in this period as a reaction to that pressure
7466735 the white ladies and gentlemen in the car even stood on the seats so they could get a good view and continued applauding the conductor for his brave stand
7466736 thereby deliberately denying african american women the basic courtesies they unquestioningly accorded white women
7466737 black women have a hell of a history to live down
7466738 rise s out of the huts of historys shame from a past thats rooted in pain leaving behind nights and days of terror and fear
7466739 shes no lady shes a nigger abuses stereotypes and realities from the middle passage to capitol and anita hill
7466740 a myth of the southern lady antebellum proslavery rhetoric and the proper place of woman
7466741 better than rubies and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared with it
7466742 had the wisdom to recognize that segregation was wrong less because of precise sociological effects and more so because it was immoral and stigmatized blacks
7466743 senator hagel and senator reed may be coming with us look they are both experts on foreign policy they reflect i think a traditional bipartisan wisdom when it comes to foreign policy neither of them are ideologues but try to get the facts right and make a determination about whats best for u s interests
7466744 the capacity for judging rightly in matters relating to life and conduct soundness of judgment in the choice of means and ends
7466745 as the exercise of judgment acting on experience common sense and available information
7466746 why do holders of high office so often act contrary to the way reason points and enlightened self interest suggests why does intelligent mental process seem so often not to function
7466747 mental standstill or stagnation the maintenance intact by rulers and policy makers of the ideas they started with
7466748 how many times do we have to learn that tough talk is not a substitute for sound judgment the real commander in chief threshold doesnt have to do with years tallied up in washington it has to do with the judgment and vision that you will bring to the oval office on the most important national security question since the cold war i am the only candidate who opposed the war in iraq from the beginning this judgment was not about speeches it was about whether or not the united states of america would go to war in iraq
7466749 i have the courage the wisdom the experience and most importantly the oldness necessary
7466750 very very great lack of experience and knowledge of the issues
7466751 he does not have the knowledge background or judgment to lead this nation in these difficult and challenging times and i do
7466752 now that its clear that the surge a 2007 substantial increase of u s troops in iraq has succeeded and brought victory in iraq within sight senator obama who was critical of the surge cant quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
7466753 how did that whole drink a beer with bush plan work out for you vote democrat
7466754 bush appears to rest his confidence in a few people whose judgment corresponds to his gut instincts he seems to be obsessive about being decisive but willing to make hard and fast decisions on the basis of ideology more than evidence
7466755 there seems to be almost an absence of any analytical or deliberative process for mapping the problem or exploring alternatives or estimating consequences
7466756 the possible unpleasant consequences of war casualties economic effects geopolitical risks diplomatic repercussions
7466757 ive learned that acquiring good judgment in politics starts with knowing when to admit your mistakes
7466758 the attribute that underpins good judgment in politicians is a sense of reality what is called wisdom in statesmen berlin wrote referring to figures like roosevelt and churchill is understanding rather than knowledge some kind of acquaintance with relevant facts of such a kind that it enables those who have it to tell what fits with what what can be done in given circumstances and what cannot what means will work in what situations and how far without necessarily being able to explain how they know this or even what they know politicians cannot afford to cocoon themselves in the inner world of their own imaginings they must not confuse the world as it is with the world as they wish it to be they must see iraq or anywhere else as it is
7466759 a short time before he the president had read barbara tuchmans book the guns of august and he talked about the miscalculations of the germans the russians the austrians the french and the british they somehow seemed to tumble into war he said through stupidity individual idiosyncrasies misunderstandings and personal complexes of inferiority and grandeur
7466760 i know how to win wars and if im elected president i will turn around the war in afghanistan just as we have turned around the war in iraq with a comprehensive strategy for victory
7466761 alone it is no substitute for good judgment a bold vision an ability to articulate it and inspire a following and a temperament and organization to translate vision into programs and policies
7466762 i want somebody who will tell me when they disagree with me i dont like having a lot of yes people around me who are just telling me what i want to hear all the time thats part of what happened with george bush he surrounded himself with people who were of the same mind as a consequence once he started making mistakes on things like iraq they just kept on saying it was going ok when it wasnt thats a huge problem thats something thats going to have to change
7466763 first you want to make sure you have a candidate thats not going to burden the ticket the second thing is and i think its the key criteria is it someone who shares your principles your values your philosophy and your priorities
7466764 change for the sake of change has no absolute merit
7466765 advantage of the great quadrennial opportunity to debate issues sensibly and soberly i hope and pray that we democrats win or lose can campaign not as a crusade to exterminate the opposing party as our opponents seem to prefer but as a great opportunity to educate and elevate a people whose destiny is leadership
7466766 more important than winning the election is governing the nation that is the test of a political party lets face it lets talk sense to the american people lets tell them the truth that there are no gains without pains
7466767 i shall always try to do justly love mercy and walk humbly with my god
7466768 the speech did not win stevenson the election but it set a standard worth emulating
7466769 if this cup may not pass from me except i drink it thy will be done
7466770 redouble their efforts to find alternatives to russian oil and gas
7466771 i think resolving the big issues like the hydrocarbons law in a way that gives sunnis the impression that their voice is heard thats going to be important
7466772 now the willingness of sunni cabinet members who have resigned to now return to have those cabinet seats filled and a sense that the sunnis are going to participate aggressively in the upcoming elections that again is i think a sign of progress
7466773 iraq is not going to be a perfect place we are not going to eliminate every trace of iranian influence
7466774 the consumer lending market has moved beyond recognition lending markets are currently beset by high market uncertainties with the ongoing credit crunch falling house prices rising arrears and repossessions and indebted consumers struggling to find credit
7466775 se faccio cavolate mi dico st da solo e non soffro per questo
7466776 i felt a wave of hot air sweeping all over me and a terrible smell of burning
7466777 i immediately unfastened the safety belt and fell to the floor the air was cooler there and we could breath

7466798 antes de verme entre la espada y la pared como muchos compa eros m os
7466799 me observaba a m mismo estudiando mi propio desarrollo sin querer jam s forzar las cosas

7466804 aurora y yo encastillados en nuestro granero nos dedicamos al trabajo a la lectura y a la audici n de los cuartetos de alban berg y schoenberg aprovechando la ventaja de que aqu no hay nadie que nos golpee el cielo raso
7466805 aurora lee por sobre mi libro y me moja una oreja con un beso para ustedes
7466806 son a os catalizadores a os en que se da una especie de coagulaci n de mi experiencia precedente de argentina de golpe en poco tiempo se produce una condensaci n de presente y pasado el pasado en suma se enchufa al presente y el resultado es una sensaci n de hostigamiento que me exigi luego escribir rayuela llegar a europa signific la necesidad de confrontar todo un sistema de valores mi manera de ver mi manera de escuchar fue una sucesi n de choques desaf os dificultades que no me hab a dado el clima infinitamente m s blando de buenos aires

7466814 una noche escuchando un concierto en el th atre des champs elys es tuve bruscamente la noci n de unos personajes que se llamar an cronopios
7466815 fue una iluminaci n termin de leer ese art culo que anunciaba la muerte de charlie parker y al otro d a o ese mismo d a no me acuerdo empec a escribir el cuento porque de inmediato sent que el personaje era l era lo que yo hab a estado buscando

7466818 escrib a largos pasajes de rayuela sin tener la menor idea de d nde se iban a ubicar y a que respond an en el fondo fue una especie de inventar en el mismo momento de escribir sin adelantarme nunca a lo que yo pod a ver en ese momento
7466819 llegar a escribir un relato capaz de mostrar c mo esas figuras costituyen una ruptura y un desmentido de la realidad individual muchas veces sin que los personajes tengan la menor conciencia de ello
7466820 esta carta se incorpora aqu a t tulo de documento puesto que razones de gorilato mayor impiden que la revista citada llegue al p blico latinoamericano

7466822 este libro se complet en 1972 la argentina estaba entonces bajo la dicadura del general alejandro lanusse y ya entonces la intensificaci n de la violencia y la violaci n de los derechos humanos eran evidentes tales abusos han continuado y han sido incrementados bajo la junta militar del general videla las referencias a argentina y otros pa ses latinoamericanos son hoy tan v lidas como lo fueron cuando se escribi este libro

7466826 die nachlassende wirtschaftliche dynamik in europa hat bereits auf das hotel und gastst ttengewerbe bergegriffen das europ ische gastgewerbe gibt teilweise deutlich vorsichtigere prognosen zur gesch ftsentwicklung ab als im letzten jahr besonders in gro britannien und spanien wo die auswirkungen der finanzmarktkrise besonders ausgepr gt sind

7466837 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7466838 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7466839 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7466840 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7466841 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7466842 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7466843 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7466844 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7466845 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7466846 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7466847 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7466848 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7466849 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7466850 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7466851 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7466852 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7466853 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7466854 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7466855 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7466856 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7466857 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses

7466859 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7466860 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7466861 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7466862 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7466863 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7466864 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7466865 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7466866 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7466867 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7466868 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7466869 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7466870 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7466871 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7466872 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7466873 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7466874 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7466875 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7466876 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7466877 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7466878 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7466879 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7466880 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7466881 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7466882 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7466883 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7466884 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7466885 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7466886 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7466887 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7466888 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7466889 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7466890 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7466891 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7466892 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7466893 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7466894 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7466895 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7466896 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7466897 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7466898 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7466899 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7466900 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7466901 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7466902 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7466903 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7466904 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7466905 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7466906 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

7466909 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7466910 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7466911 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7466912 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets

7466915 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7466916 this is a planning took where all things are going
7466917 may initiate a request to grow the greenbelt at the same time as it is undertaking its growth plan conformity exercise
7466918 all these municipalities are working on a conformity exercise and hopefully they are going to meet the deadline but you throw this into the mix and they could be sidetracked the next thing you know this could be an excuse for delay
7466919 we could have planned without it the county of simcoes new official plan protects over a third of the entire county as it is i think we are well on the way to achieving and meeting what it is that is what this direction from the province is trying to get at
7466920 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today

7466922 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7466923 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7466924 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7466925 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7466926 ne propunem sa ne consolidam pozitia de lider pe piata de asigurari si pensii prin accelerarea cresterii pe segmentul asigurarilor de viata si continuarea eforturilor de dezvoltare si educare a pietei fondurilor de pensii facultative
7466927 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7466928 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7466929 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7466930 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings

7466942 i feel for kenny i think he should be walking away with a gold medal
7466943 the scorings not been very good all the way through but there it was terrible
7466944 zhang was hitting kenny on the arms which is not a scoring shot but the crowd were going mad it wand was they who were effectively pressing the button
7466945 when kenny was hitting him with good clean shots they werent scoring and zhang was touching kenny with little shots and scoring
7466946 i think kenny should have won by three or four points
7466947 i believe that in the first round that i was leading by two points but i think the other three rounds were pretty equal in terms of points
7466948 i believe that in terms of tactics were are similar and we are similar in terms of our skills
7466949 thats why we have him in an awful lot earlier this year to give us the time to get work into him i read in the paper the other day that katchit is still only on the walker were a good six weeks ahead of them
7466950 there are plenty of opportunities for him and were hoping to run him a lot more this year we might start off in the fighting fifth at newcastle november 29
7466951 if he wins that we might go to kempton for the christmas hurdle which leads us to the million bonus for winning the champion hurdle but theres always punchestown down royal and leopardstown around christmas
7466952 if we perform as we have done over the last few weeks its going to be extremely difficult to beat standard liege
7466953 theyre not a mickey mouse team they won their league and proved in the first leg how good they are
7466954 we realise we have to step it up a level on wednesday but we have won two out of two and long may that continue
7466955 maybe i havent had the chance to show him what im about
7466956 i always felt i trained well with england and hopefully hes seen that but im yet to start a game for him
7466957 all i can do is keep knocking on the door by knocking goals in
7466958 i know some people have advocated the scrapping of the international rules series but i challenge that view
7466959 there is no basis for believing that the recruitment of some of our best young talent would stop if the series ended
7466960 i ask you to wait until gaa director general paraic duffy and i have engaged with the afl officers in october after which we will report back to the ard comhairle and that body will decide on any future strategy
7466961 i have said on many occasions that we have no hold over these players if they wish to travel to australia he continued
7466962 however i remain concerned they are being sold a lifestyle that is not achievable
7466963 it may work out for a player or two but for the majority it will end in failure setanta readers comment of the day
7466964 the alpha 1 version contained only the mash up functionality and web page designer but this past may saw the alpha 2 version with the game developer
7466965 any time you have 12 penalties and 10 of them are on offensive plays thats an issue
7466966 thats something we have to do a much better job on
7466967 it just looks really bad when they start coming in piles it just doesnt look good when you are fighting yourself it becomes second and long third and long its just not a good situation
7466968 we had some big plays that were unfortunately called back
7466969 all we have to do is watch the film to see that we have a lot of potential it just goes to show how little things can lead to big things they are things that can be corrected rather quickly and easily but you cant win making those types of mistakes
7466970 i didnt do a good enough job emphasizing getting the tackles up even tighter than they were
7466971 like i said that did come down from the league that was a point of emphasis anytime thats a point of emphasis you better get it fixed and you better get it straightened out i could have done a much better job with that the other ones illegal shifts were concentration errors where we had two guys moving
7466972 as disappointing as it was that those plays were called back we see at the end result how good it can be
7466973 you can say were close its a matter of opinion but the fact is if we clean those penalties up i think we can be pretty productive
7466974 he coach eric mangini has no intention of letting him odea go
7466975 you definitely have to let coaches know to have a lot of confidence in you that things like that wont happen
7466976 i know what i did wrong it just didnt go through
7466977 in my mind im the kansas city chiefs kicker im going to continue to prove that in practice and in the next game
7466978 zimbabwe has many unique strengths on which to build a successful recovery programme yet nothing should be taken for granted
7466979 if there is a significant change in policies there is no reason why zimbabwe shouldnt be able to attract foreign direct investment
7466980 it zimbabwe no longer enjoys the monopoly of quality products
7466981 the ministry realised the importance of catching the children while they are still young as this empowers the children with the required skills before they start their primary education
7466982 the city of masvingo is the emotional home of every zimbabwean and the destination where the countrys name is derived from but the focus has not been in favour of masvingo but on destinations like the victoria falls
7466983 we want masvingo to be the number one destination in zimbabwe and we are proud to say that great zimbabwe is the only tourist attraction that is 100 percent owned by zimbabwe
7466984 we can assure you that there is not going to be that kind of problem we experienced in april when hoteliers were charging exorbitant rates and we have already talked to them

7466987 everywhere around the site there were body parts of the unfortunate passengers you could hear screams and moans there was a horrible stench of burning bodies
7466988 our three telephones were calling incessantly people were crying could not speak yelled at us demanding to know how we allowed such a tragedy there were children there young sportsmen and their parents grief was overwhelming
7466989 people were kissing what remained of their loved ones even we who should be used to anything could not look at this and turned away not to begin crying too

7466992 as a precautionary measure to ensure that law and order is maintained
7466993 to scare the heck out of you about the democratic nominee
7466994 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us comes from a middle class background went to school on scholarships had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about childcare and figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7466995 but ultimately this election is not about me its about you and whether we are going to allow ourselves to watch this country get run into the ground
7466996 whether we are going to do the same old things over and over and over again and somehow expect a different result or whether we are finally going to decide not this time this time were going to try something different
7466997 i am still tooling around with my speech a little bit
7466998 it may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choice that the american people are going to face in november
7466999 i have respect for john mccains service i dont have respect for john mccains policies because they represent four more years of the same
7467000 the same attitude and the same out of touch policies
7467001 well first of all let me say that i am grateful for the fact that i have a wonderful life i spent some years without a kitchen table without a chair
7467002 so all i can say is i am blessed to have the opportunity to continue to be part of a country where you can succeed and do well

7467010 i think losing today is going to be the best warning that we can be given
7467011 we could really see as soon as we dont play together and we dont put our spirit together we can lose the game
7467012 so i think these are the things we have to put together as soon as we play our football with the same spirit and play to help each other on the pitch we have no reason to lose the games
7467013 i dont think we had all those things on saturday and we lost the game anyway now its already behind us and we have to have a clear focus on wednesdays game
7467014 we didnt think about losing this early but thats football we lost and we just have to put it behind us and tomorrow is another day
7467015 i think we just learn the negative things we have done in this game and keep on going
7467016 you have to show character to show personality and we have to get back our confidence as quickly as possible
7467017 when you lose a game the solution is not always to buy
7467018 did we play at our best i say no and so we have to look at why
7467019 we had problems to win our first few games last year but we won them this year we did not win that is the reality we had 60 minutes to come back on fulham and we did not do it is that down to fulham s quality or the fact we were not good enough only the future will tell us that

7467031 since sri lanka had a colourful crowd it becomes difficult to spot the ball in the night specially after it ball becomes a bit dirty
7467032 having a fifth bowler is a luxury we have to make do with four bowlers but we have bowlers like yuvraj raina and virat who can bowl we needed one extra batsman
7467033 earlier india had batsmen who could play till the end and i could go for big shots early i am however happy that i still have strike rate of 90 though i would have been happier to have a strike rate of over hundred
7467034 when you are scoring centuries you dont ask these questions every batsman has highs and lows the idea of playing sangakkara as opener is to have some senior batsman to get more balls to play

7467051 losses incurred by japanese financial institutions due to the subprime mortgage problem are limited compared with those of us and european financial institutions and japanese financial markets continue to be stable
7467052 you go into some of these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothings replaced them so its not surprising then that they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them
7467053 is it because we are over thirty that we like fleet foxes
7467054 can we write about music made by teenagers for teenagers when we are well beyond that explosion of hormonal excitement
7467055 initially girls studying in class 6 to class 8 would be able to avail the scheme later girls of class 1 to class 5 will also be included
7467056 when we first went there we found homeless people in wheelchairs begging at the bus station in freetown
7467057 the homeless in sierra leone aren t people who ve just had enough of where they live and leave they have lost their home and their families during the civil war and have nothing
7467058 unless we get cash we will struggle with a project to buy a farm so that the homeless and disabled can grow their own food and become self sufficient
7467059 so i just knew i had to do something about it to try and raise some money because we do need a lot of it
7467060 being arctic monkeys the polar opposite would be desert monkeys so theyre gonna come out and just experience that and their idea is to submerge themselves in something else and do some tracks
7467061 i dont think theres any reason to bring anyone else in
7467062 i think they just want to experience something thats opposite to what theyre used to in the uk and its a good place to go to make some music for the sake of making music
7467063 when we got to play with them and see them live it gave us a kick up the arse they show you can still have top tunes and loud heavy songs too its a lot more fun playing loud music simple as that
7467064 this is a message of defiance to the international community we call on the unamid peacekeepers to do their job and defend the idps internally displaced persons
7467065 i am inside the camp kalma now there is still shooting
7467066 there is heavy shooting they came into the camp and killed people there are houses burning
7467067 the idp are resisting we are expecting casualties they the government of sudan want to demolish kalma camp they want to force people to leave
7467068 we confirmed that the denuclearisation of north korea will be achieved through six party talks
7467069 president lee and i agreed that the 6 party talks are now at a key stage
7467070 we sincerely hope that the south and the north can maintain the momentum of reconciliation and cooperation
7467071 malheureusement une fois encore nous avons connu un probl me de fiabilit cette fois sur la voiture de kimi regrette stefano domenicali le directeur de la gestion sportive de ferrari cela nous a fait perdre de pr cieux points et maintenant il va nous falloir comprendre exactement ce qui sest pass propos de cette nouvelle casse moteur et d cider de la mani re dont nous allons r agir

7467076 its fantastic i keep switching the lights on and off
7467077 they all come on at once instead of having to be lit with a match
7467078 before i used a black leaded one which i heated on the stove i had to be careful to avoid black marks
7467079 now i can iron my trousers in less than half an hour
7467080 if you think about how an operating system is loaded
7467081 the operating system is tied very tightly to that hardware
7467082 if windows ends up being less important over time as applications become more os agnostic where will microsoft make its money
7467083 midori is one of many incubation projects underway at microsoft its simply a matter of being too early in the incubation to talk about it
7467084 the real savings are around physical management of the devices and associated licensing
7467085 virtualising this gives you a couple of new ways to tackle those traditional problems
7467086 on the desktop we are seeing people place great value in being able to abstract the desktop from actual physical hardware
7467087 people take their application the operating system they want to run it against package it up along with policy and security they want and use that as a virtual client
7467088 the value of microsoft windows of what that product is today will diminish as more applications move to the web and microsoft needs to edge out in front of that
7467089 i would be surprised if there was definitive evidence that nothing like this was not kicking around
7467090 eighty percent of windows sales are made when a new pc is sold
7467091 thats a huge amount of money for them that they do
7467092 if windows ends up being less important over time as applications become more os agnostic where will microsoft make its money
7467093 la decisi n de no ponerle ha sido m a sin duda que es una situaci n inc moda para l y para nosotros pero estamos intentando hacer lo mejor le convoqu para que estuviese cerca del equipo a ver qu pasa al final hay que pensar positivo para que se quede con nosotros esta temporada
7467094 para m robinho ahora es el mismo que hace un a o un jugador importante para nosotros deber a ser parte de este proyecto creo que es lo mejor para l triunfar con el real madrid es un tema que hay que resolver lo mejor posible tenemos que ser ego stas todos buscamos lo mejor y ser a que siga con nosotros con toda la tranquilidad del mundo
7467095 esto pasa muy pocas veces para m es la primera nunca lo viv como jugador ni como entrenador pero el f tbol siempre depara sorpresas confiaba en que hay equipos como el valencia que tienen problemas de jugar con uno o dos m s hemos tenido la suerte de que no han sabido jugar con esa ventaja
7467096 un equipo tiene que tener una mentalidad el a o pasado la demostr y contra todas las dificultades que podemos tener hoy en d a lo hemos vuelto a hacer
7467097 la reacci n del equipo ha sido positiva creyeron que se pod a ir a por el partido y en la segunda parte vimos un partido muy bonito emocionante y justo por la entrega de todos los jugadores que estuvieron en el campo
7467098 no vamos a cerrar los ojos solo por el triunfo y la forma de la que lo hemos hecho
7467099 hay una base de equipo que nos gusta pero vamos a estar despiertos hasta el ltimo d a a ver si algo es posible pero somos el real madrid y fichar o traer gente es m s complicado que para otros equipos no va a ser f cil
7467100 the appeal addressed to russian president and accepted by the council of federation due to recognition of separatist regions in georgia will not arouse any surprise as russia tries to do it for a long period

7467107 weve been hooked up for a while and now were doing this
7467108 especially with the star wars brand and indiana jones we already have more notoriety than we need if were going to give it to something we might as well give it to racing ive lived through the andretti legends and now marco is carrying that on
7467109 this place sits at the intersection of racing and wine
7467110 since i started here my ambition has been to not only be in wine country but to be active in wine making
7467111 we have not had one second of problem as a coaching staff with our team
7467112 weve been joined at the hip for the last three years
7467113 we had a common goal so that was kind of a culmination i never expected to be kissed by coach k but that was a great moment
7467114 i want to thank coach k for believing in me and ive told him that
7467115 he was the one who was always checking on me seeing how i was doing he was the one who believed in me coming back to this team

7467118 les relations entre chr tiens sont plus intimes notamment parce que les partenaires prient ensemble par exemple
7467119 ils sont capables de mieux relativiser le sexe parce que ce nest pas le plus important dans leur vie faire lamour r guli rement avec son partenaire en combinaison avec une vie de croyant d vou am ne la satisfaction sexuelle
7467120 il nexiste aucun lien entre la religion et une vie sexuelle panouie les gens heureux sont en g n ral plus satisfaits de leur vie au lit que les autres mais les chr tiens ne sont pas plus heureux que les non chr tiens donc pas plus satisfaits sur le plan sexuel vos croyances peuvent avoir un aspect positif sur votre vie mais aussi n gatif beaucoup de personnes ne parviennent pas voluer sexuellement cause de leur croyance mon cabinet de consultation en est rempli

7467134 maybe i havent had the chance to show him what im about
7467135 i always felt i trained well with england and hopefully hes seen that but im yet to start a game for him
7467136 all i can do is keep knocking on the door by knocking goals in
7467137 thats why we have him in an awful lot earlier this year to give us the time to get work into him i read in the paper the other day that katchit is still only on the walker were a good six weeks ahead of them
7467138 there are plenty of opportunities for him and were hoping to run him a lot more this year we might start off in the fighting fifth at newcastle november 29
7467139 if he wins that we might go to kempton for the christmas hurdle which leads us to the million bonus for winning the champion hurdle but theres always punchestown down royal and leopardstown around christmas
7467140 i feel for kenny i think he should be walking away with a gold medal
7467141 the scorings not been very good all the way through but there it was terrible
7467142 zhang was hitting kenny on the arms which is not a scoring shot but the crowd were going mad it wand was they who were effectively pressing the button
7467143 when kenny was hitting him with good clean shots they werent scoring and zhang was touching kenny with little shots and scoring
7467144 i think kenny should have won by three or four points
7467145 i believe that in the first round that i was leading by two points but i think the other three rounds were pretty equal in terms of points
7467146 i believe that in terms of tactics were are similar and we are similar in terms of our skills
7467147 i know some people have advocated the scrapping of the international rules series but i challenge that view
7467148 there is no basis for believing that the recruitment of some of our best young talent would stop if the series ended
7467149 i ask you to wait until gaa director general paraic duffy and i have engaged with the afl officers in october after which we will report back to the ard comhairle and that body will decide on any future strategy
7467150 i have said on many occasions that we have no hold over these players if they wish to travel to australia he continued
7467151 however i remain concerned they are being sold a lifestyle that is not achievable
7467152 it may work out for a player or two but for the majority it will end in failure setanta readers comment of the day
7467153 if we perform as we have done over the last few weeks its going to be extremely difficult to beat standard liege
7467154 theyre not a mickey mouse team they won their league and proved in the first leg how good they are
7467155 we realise we have to step it up a level on wednesday but we have won two out of two and long may that continue

7467166 ive seen things that no training can prepare you for
7467167 how can i feed my family how can i give my children a future
7467168 thats what i am asking god every day every single day
7467169 the restaurant is just down the street from the police post that was blown up
7467170 his office is across from the courthouse you know the one where that attack happened
7467171 sometimes people look like they want to cry when they are paying for their groceries
7467172 they are searching their handbags and their pockets for every single coin i look away when this happens
7467173 my schoolwork is affected because it is too hot and too dark to study inside my home
7467174 i sit out on the roof until the light fades too much for me to read anymore i want to become educated and better myself but it is very hard
7467175 unless the government appears to the outside world to be competent and stable which it most certainly does not at the moment foreign investment wont be coming back and economic recovery will be very difficult
7467176 and a bad economy generates support for the insurgency even in pakistan where people on the whole really do not want to be ruled by islamists
7467177 but the extremists are seen as the main alternative to the government so in bad times people turn to them
7467178 this has reinforced the very cynical feeling pakistanis have had for many years about the relationship with the united states theyll use you and then theyll ditch you
7467179 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7467180 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7467181 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7467182 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7467183 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7467184 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig
7467185 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7467186 i think its the number one thing that brings frustration anxiety and knots in your stomach all the things that go along with the injury to the players which do not allow your team to function as it is presented on paper
7467187 those types of things are very difficult for coaches no matter what age you are
7467188 they were always swearing and shouting they were neighbours from hell
7467189 he does operate as a person on a very basic level and is receiving anti psychotic medication
7467190 he is sorry and is doing the best he can
7467191 you are a disgrace wasting public time and causing upset to neighbours
7467192 if you step out of line you go to prison
7467193 you have made peoples lives absolute hell and there is no excuse
7467194 if there is trouble at your new address and you breach your asbo you will go to prison
7467195 if the gymnast goes and eats a big mac i would guess thats a rare thing rather than a frequent occurrence and thats completely fine
7467196 any healthy and sustainable nutrition program is going to allow a certain margin of eating those types of foods
7467197 you should be stretching out before and after your run
7467198 because your muscles are cold if you do too much static stretching at the beginning of a workout you can end up over stretching a muscle
7467199 the mental side is the one thing that overrides everything youve done in preparation
7467200 if something doesnt go as well as you would like what can you do in response
7467201 whether its the olympic games or youre doing a group presentation at work there are things that increase peoples anxiety
7467202 the worst part was the recovery it was really really long because the delivery was really really long
7467203 what we learned was very generic i just didnt have any skills to draw on no action plan
7467204 some women become so relaxed they dont experience pain at all
7467205 generally in north american society people expect labour to go badly and they expect you to have an epidural and they expect you to have some kind of pain relief unlike in other cultures where childbirth is regarded as natural and normal
7467206 and even if there is a positive aspect of a birth that had an epidural or had an intervention the baby came out healthy and the mother was so happy people dont focus on that part they focus on the negative the labour was so horrible and long
7467207 hypnobirthing is the opposite its just an expectation that you can do it
7467208 i think thats the main point actually of the whole thing to believe in your bodys ability to have babies
7467209 it is an extensive injury that takes considerable time i have heard it said four months but again probably each individual is somewhat different the doctors have told me that this will be a four month recovery
7467210 dr warren has convinced us that this repair will put him in great shape going forward and because of that we are certainly 100 percent behind the decision
7467211 we just hope that the surgery goes well and that it is a full recovery and that he is even better than ever shortly down the road
7467212 it was obviously the news i didnt want to hear but after listening to the explanation and dr
7467213 we have to do a great job of getting our players refocused and our thoughts on going forward
7467214 someone has already raised that today and i havent really talked to anyone at this point in time about anything
7467215 i am sure that general manager jerry reese and i and ownership will look long and hard at whatever options are out there and do what is best here at this point in time
7467216 i have not had a chance to talk to anyone i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi kiwanuka this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7467217 with the medical people last night saturday there was no attempt to not make us aware of the possible severity of the injury
7467218 it was just that obviously nothing had been done yet there was no mri they could not conduct a full exam and once that was conducted then the doctors felt very strongly about this choice of action
7467219 i dont have a whole lot of comment about it the only thing i have talked to michael about is his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7467220 the number one thing that brings frustration anxiety and knots in your stomach is all the things that go along with the injury to the players which do not allow your team to function as it is presented on paper those types of things are very difficult for coaches no matter what age you are

7467234 people think that if they take a medication their body absorbs it and it disappears but of course thats not the case

7467237 everything that g d created in his world he did not create but for his glory as is stated
7467238 all that is called by my name and for my glory i created it formed it also i made it
7467239 rabbi chanania ben akashia said g d wanted to give merits to the jewish people so he gave them an abundance of mitzvahs
7467240 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
7467241 once he perpetrated a fraud that goes into his credibility and integrity
7467242 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7467243 some people have said its as big a financial shock as the great depression and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal in the 1970s
7467244 there are periods when markets look like they are getting better then another grenade explodes another bout of fear of sustainability of some financial institutions maybe intervention by the authorities
7467245 it has been very much ebb and flow and the mood here is very much one of financial caution as regards the next year we have our fingers crossed but there is the recognition there is still quite a long way to go yet
7467246 on the assumption commodity prices remain stable and if anything fall back then inflation should drop back as we go through next year
7467247 one would hope that the conditions in credit markets should gradually start to improve and those two factors will help to ensure growth will start to pick up as we go through next year
7467248 its going to be a tricky period household real income is very low that will make it difficult for households and there are difficult social issues that will arise
7467249 but the important thing is people realise this is just a transitory period of subdued of growth and we will get through the other side and growth will resume to more normal levels
7467250 hopefully we can go back to something like the steady growth that we experienced over the past decade
7467251 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door

7467301 we dont yet have figures on the number of accidents in rural areas nationwide over the years but by viewing local incidents we can tell its a growing trend
7467302 along with the increasing number of vehicles peoples lack of traffic safety knowledge is considered the biggest reason for accidents
7467303 whenever i come back to my hometown in giao thuy district i feel scared because a lot of young people are driving motorbikes fast without wearing helmets
7467304 i started driving a motorbike at the age of 16 when my father taught me i drive my mother and a lot of goods to the market every morning where she sells vegetables and things
7467305 in addition to peoples lack of knowledge about traffic safety poor infrastructure in rural areas is also leading to increased accidents
7467306 according to decree 32 the ministry of public security issued document no 1207 on july 2 2007 to allow police to be organised at local levels like in communes wards and hamlets to directly ensure traffic safety
7467307 clearly the duties of the local police are very difficult at the moment
7467308 however not all local police are aware of the importance of this role it is time to improve local police activities related to traffic safety

7467339 companies that value organizational learning not only tend to become more successful over time they attract and retain talented individuals

7467386 um den stromverbrauch rapide zu senken brauchen wir jetzt eine schnelle und effektive anwendung energieeffizienter ger te in allen bev lkerungskreisen nur so kann die bundesregierung ihr ziel noch erreichen den co2 aussto bis 2020 um 40 prozent im vergleich zu 1990 zu verringern
7467387 gerade einkommensschwachen familien muss es erm glicht werden mit effizienten ger ten ihre stromkosten zu reduzieren durch das marktanreizprogramm w rden effiziente modelle endlich preiswerter und in gro er st ckzahl auf den markt kommen
7467388 ecotopten ist bei verbraucherinnen auf sehr gro e resonanz gesto en und auch von seiten der hersteller hat das interesse an immer mehr zugenommen
7467389 nur wer sich vor dem einkauf ber die folgekosten und die kologischen auswirkungen seiner kaufentscheidung im klaren ist kann sie zugunsten der umwelt und des geldbeutels ausrichten
7467390 im bereich der wei en ware und der raumklimager te sind die energieeffizienz auszeichnungen vielfach unzureichend weil das daf r vorgesehene label einfach fehlt oder unvollst ndig ist zum beispiel scheinen viele k chenh ndler gar nicht zu wissen dass die kennzeichnungspflicht auch f r einbauger te gilt
7467391 solche fehlinformationen k nnten mit geschultem personal leicht vermieden werden
7467392 die pflegeversicherung ist nach dem aktuellen gesetz nicht nur weiter reformbed rftig sondern der reformbedarf hat sich sogar weiter erh ht die finanzierung der beschlossenen leistungsausweitungen erfolgt nach wie vor im umlageverfahren aber nur der einstieg in die kapitaldeckung schafft eine langfristig tragf hige l sung
7467393 jeder kennt die langfristigen probleme umlagefinanzierter sozialversicherungssysteme und es liegt eine reihe von konkreten vorschl gen vor wie im interesse k nftiger generationen eine nachhaltige finanzierung der pflegeversicherung gew hrleistet werden kann

7467396 das autorenteam hat sich dramatische geschichten ausgedacht die zuschauer d rfen sich auf wirklich tolle folgen freuen
7467397 john repudiates some of the bush administrations approach to the world
7467398 he recognizes that the power of our example is as important as the example of our power that allies we respect not disdain can advance our interests he is especially eloquent about his abhorrence for war as john is uniquely placed to be
7467399 start to listen to john mccain instead of the secretary of defense because they have totally different no i shouldnt say totally many have very different views of how to proceed
7467400 establishing an effective balance of power in the region will be achieved only if all middle east west asia countries undertake to ban the use of nuclear and other mass destruction weapons
7467401 one of the major challenges is in providing adequate health care facilities for the growing population of our country there is a shortage of both trained doctors and nurses
7467402 this needs to be addressed at the national and regional levels i am happy that the assam government is taking major steps to overcome the shortage in health care
7467403 five of the southern states have more than 60 per cent of the medical colleges in the country this uneven distribution of medical facility is the root cause of the problem
7467404 there is no need for the pml n to be part of the coalition government if one party is taking decisions unilaterally
7467405 attendance of the company officials was normal but that of the contractual workers was less than normal
7467406 naveen patnaik should publicly apologies to the people of the state for his governments failure in protecting sadhus and saints it was naveen individual responsibility to protect them
7467407 accusing it of being unable to discharge its duty and responsibility
7467408 we are not demanding naveens resignation but a public apology by him
7467409 a vehicle pulled into the parking lot and a couple of people walked by and said something
7467410 words were exchanged and the person inside the suv pulled out a gun
7467411 we know that kids in activities do better in school and are less likely to drop out
7467412 we are committed to ensuring that every student who wants to participate may do so regardless of income
7467413 it basically is taking a net and raking it on the bottom and anything that sticks up from the bottom gets bulldozed over it is similar to forest clear cutting
7467414 should the concentrations of fish move to the north it actually could be harmful to keep us from going where the fish are
7467415 one of the things that was very exciting about it the locomotives that were used here are no longer in juneau so it was a wonderful opportunity to bring back a piece of mining history
7467416 that fact that they werent scrapped thrown away or for that matter really modified where it would have taken away the historical significance of them is just an amazing thing
7467417 for the most part alaskas mining history the equipment was scrapped and salvaged so its just amazing
7467418 it was part of an operation that changed the course of mining history
7467419 it ran off electricity its a trolley locomotive and it pulled 40 10 ton ore cars so it was the big ore train
7467420 they are the most well documented locomotives in the history of the state in terms of mining locomotives
7467421 the first thing we needed to do is take the opportunity to acquire the artifact
7467422 the marine mammal protection act and more importantly the endangered species act protects those guys even after death
7467423 so collection of soft or hard parts bone or baleen or blubber is illegal
7467424 we could potentially develop a situation that we havent yet where the local bears discover it
7467425 since that hasnt happened were just kind of monitoring the situation at this point
7467426 after tomorrows high tide wherever it parks is probably where its going to land
7467427 there is a remote chance that it could float free but i dont think it will itll probably anchor itself there
7467428 we determined that it would be a challenge that probably couldnt be met
7467429 there are a lot of reefs out in front of that rocky outcrop of the beach and theres a pretty good chance it would just break up if we tried to throw a line around it
7467430 once it deflates itll just look like a big piece of carpet laying on top of a lot of skeletal remains
7467431 its not 100 percent but the theory right now is that its one of those whales
7467432 the fact that its lower jaw is missing is one indication of that its an area that orcas attack to kind of go after the tongue
7467433 there was some evidence that it had been predated on
7467434 but its difficult to say whether that might have happened before or after it died
7467435 there are some theories bouncing around that these animals are being weakened by a toxin and its increasing their susceptibility to being attacked by killer whales
7467436 the toxin isnt necessarily killing them but its weakening them enough so that theyre vulnerable
7467437 the police and an ambulance show up everybodys running around with bear spray all these ladies are on cell phones screaming theres three cubs in the tree
7467438 it was just an incident where he was driving down the road and the bear darted out of the woods
7467439 its heavily wooded right up to the side of the road there and they werent able to avoid colliding with it
7467440 there was a winnebago going the other direction to the hotel and to the right some cars were pulled off to the side
7467441 once the winnebago went by we saw the bear we were going about 15 20 mph and the bear hit the fender before peter even got on the brakes
7467442 weve had a lot of calls this year relating to black bears getting into peoples trash
7467443 most people at this point are securing their trash but the bears are ripping doors off sheds and eating 40 pound bags of dog food in a sitting
7467444 one shimmied up a tree and jumped onto a second floor deck to get to a bag of trash theyre pretty innovated
7467445 the bear ran off into the woods and the guy had a little dimple in his bumper

7467455 the routing of a busy road slap bang through the tara skryne valley represents an act of vandalism with not only national but international ramifications
7467456 for the past two millennia those generations regarded tara as a place invested with sacred as opposed to secular value protest against the loss of this value remains an imperative
7467457 literally desecrates an area i mean the word means to desacralise and for centuries the tara landscape and the tara sites have been regarded as part of the sacred ground
7467458 if ever there was a place that deserved to be preserved in the name of the dead generations from pre historic times it was tara

7467507 earthworms help ragweed thrive by systematically collecting and burying its seeds in their burrows
7467508 in fact weve found that more than two thirds of all giant ragweed seedlings emerge from earthworm burrows
7467509 our study shows that nightcrawlers are some of natures most effective weed farmers
7467510 they actively forage for weed seeds pull them into their burrows and then plant them under up to several inches of soil
7467511 we found the worms collect and bury 10 types of seeds in the same size range
7467512 but they have three special favorites giant ragweed bur cucumber sicyos angulatus and sunflower helianthus annuus
7467513 research that helps us understand the accumulation of weed seeds in the soil and how weeds are spread is critical to the development of new effective management strategies
7467514 giant ragweed should be vigorously controlled in fields and gardens in order to minimize further seed production and protect plant growth and crop yields

7467553 when older adults become isolated fragile or suffer cognitive decline their diets often suffer
7467554 they tend to eat foods like toast sweets or junk food rather than cook healthy meals
7467555 both malnutrition and dehydration exacerbate existing chronic conditions weaken the immune system and negatively impact overall health the ramifications of improper nutrition can be quite devastating on older adults
7467556 our latest caregiver training dvd teaches people exactly what they need to know about proper nutrition for people over the age of 70
7467557 it includes the new tufts food pyramid guidelines for this age group and other valuable information in a 43 minute training program
7467558 caregivers play an important role in helping older adults remain healthy by providing nutritious meals
7467559 when caregivers understand the importance of nutrition and how to provide it a host of complications can be avoided

7467565 apple aapl starts selling an album called songs for tibet on its itunes music store itms and it does it right in the middle of the beijing olympics coincidence or passive aggressive middle finger to china
7467566 we are aware of the logon problems but we have no comment at the moment
7467567 my name is bryan and i understand that you have not been able to connect to the itunes store for the last couple days and that you are concerned that it would be an issue with china blocking the itunes store im sorry to hear that and im happy to assist you with this today itunes is not being blocked in china from our end but access to the itunes store is restricted in some areas in china this would also explain why its happening to your friends there as well i would advise that you contact your isp about this matter please also note though that accessing the us itunes store outside of the geographic region of the united states is not supported and that attempting to access it while in china is at your own risk service policies are available for you to review
7467568 i am sure there were valid marketing considerations behind the decision to sell songs for tibet ill even grant the specious possibility that there was a good business reason to do so during the olympics if not apple was certainly within its rights to make a political statement but apple and its shareholders must recognize that its own actions are sabotaging its efforts to build a market in china right as those efforts are showing fruit such a bi polar approach to this market is not sustainable apple management needs to choose between developing china as a market or the freedom to engage in random acts of passive aggressive panda punching making that choice as much as real estate and labor expenses is part of the cost of doing business in china
7467569 apple has just learned that the choices you make across your business can affect your prospects in china success in china does not mean avoiding such conflicts but in dealing with them intelligently and proactively

7467576 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage
7467577 if we want to retain our position as a constructive eu member state we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
7467578 mr roche is not calling for a second referendum to be put that would not be a fair reflection the government is instead following the steps it said it would take in the wake of the referendum outcome
7467579 we now need to take a hard look at our situation within the eu
7467580 we have to recognise however that all other member states 26 sovereign democratic parliaments are likely to have ratified the treaty by the end of the year this will leave ireland in an isolated position
7467581 in the view of the other member states we will be preventing the eu from equipping itself to deal with the many political and economic challenges facing todays europe
7467582 not an inch is not a policy that has much to commend it in a dynamic europe that wants to move forward
7467583 we have to explore all possible solutions we cannot exclude the possibility that at some stage and in the right circumstances it may be necessary to consult the people once again
7467584 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage
7467585 i dont believe we will succeed in bringing the corpses back
7467586 because they ended up in a zone of high risk with unstable ice pillars which have a high risk of collapse at the most we might be able to survey the area to see whether some signs of the presence of the bodies have emerged the only certain thing is that these people are beyond hope of being rescued

7467591 part of our ethos at momentum is to expand northern irelands economic wellbeing through growth in the ict sector
7467592 we decided to take this ethos a bit further by working with habitat for humanity whose vision is of a world where every one has a decent place to live
7467593 we are asking northern ireland businesses across the economic spectrum to become involved by offering financial support
7467594 taking part in one of our global village projects allows people from northern ireland to contribute in a very real and practical way to improving the lives of those in need
7467595 it also changes the perspectives of those who take part and creates advocates for change in our world momentum will be making a vital and lasting contribution to the community they work with in ghana
7467596 four or five national governing bodies elsewhere in europe want to come and have a look at what were doing because they think weve had a really good games
7467597 my perception is that we havent done as well as we want to be or as we need to be doing
7467598 four medals are clearly not going to be enough in london i cant categorically promise but i am very confident we will do better ill bet my job on it
7467599 i have read the speculation about my future with interest
7467600 i havent heard anything on the subject from either my chief executive or my chairman
7467601 thats the length of time it takes to create what you might call a super programme
7467602 i know with 2012 round the corner we havent got long thats why im frustrated that we have wasted time in the area of sports development where we havent done enough this sport is a super tanker and i think weve turned it i think we are sailing into better water but weve just to keep the effort going
7467603 theres a lot more things that are right with the sport today than there were when i took over in 2005 we might have had two or three more medals here the disqualification in the mens sprint relay was down to human error but the womens sprint relay team were knocked out of their lane by the jamaicans when they were up on russia and they might possibly have won a gold
7467604 athletics would themselves agree that they have not delivered in the way that our most successful sports have
7467605 with the london games it would be crazy to go
7467606 its the greatest job in the world to take a british team into the london games the worst job would be to lead a foreign team in that olympics i do not think i could stomach that the national pride would not allow me to do it no matter what somebody paid me
7467607 the key message is things are going to be slightly worse rather than slightly better
7467608 there are three factors all happening at once the structural the cyclical and the structural multiplied by the cyclical
7467609 all of which makes for a pretty miserable outlook in the near term
7467610 i welcome the latest application from westfield which will include the first john lewis store in northern ireland
7467611 despite all the setbacks there have been it is reassuring that john lewis and westfield still see a future in investing in northern ireland i really do hope that this time the application will be able to proceed
7467612 i believe the development will be reduced in terms of the number of units and hopefully this will address the concerns raised previously by other retail interests in belfast and craigavon
7467613 the harsh reality is that we are in competition with many other locations john lewis plans to open two new stores in the republic one at dundrum shopping centre and the other at oconnell street in dublin
7467614 they have also said that if they are unable to secure permission for sprucefield they will open a third store north of dublin designed to attract shoppers from northern ireland
7467615 the message from the company is clear either we get a store at sprucefield or we lose this investment and the republic will be the beneficiary
7467616 all this stuff terry has been getting at home all this bulls t is not nice
7467617 its hard to say no to a million pounds but if they come to me with a sensible offer and terry is ok well that could be me signing for four years and going into the next olympics i could be a little superstar in amateur boxing and i could earn some decent dough winning another gold medal in 2012 in my home city imagine that and to be the face of the london olympics would be unbelievable deep in my heart i think london 2012 thats me if terry stays thats me i think he could keep four or five of us from the beijing team
7467618 i had just been thinking let me just get through this
7467619 it was hard tonight but everything proved worthwhile he was holding me throwing me it was horrible then his little gold teeth were munching me up but i kept thinking i want this and im going to get it
7467620 when i said i dont need this and that maybe i should spend more time at home which is something my wife deserves but the way i feel now having seen the team exceed its targets and with a record of three olympic finals in three olympics and two gold medals i do have this urge to carry on with this team we can a have real impact on the next olympics we could be the new cuba of amateur boxing
7467621 the vaticans decision to move cardinal newmans body from its resting place is an act of grave robbery and religious desecration it violates newmans repeated wish to be buried for eternity with his life long partner ambrose st john
7467622 they have been together for more than 100 years and the vatican wants to disturb that peace to cover up the fact that cardinal newman loved a man its shameful dishonourable betrayal of newman by the gay hating catholic church
7467623 i dont think anyone disputes that cardinal newman deeply loved ambrose st john he did say after st john died that the grief is comparable to a husband losing a wife or wife losing a husband but he did not mean that the relationship with ambrose st john was a marriage like a gay relationship it is simply wrong to read back from todays categories into the victorian periods when these very intense passionate but totally celibate relationships in oxford and among the anglocatholic community were very common
7467624 i wish with all my heart to be buried in father ambrose st johns grave and i give this as my last my imperative will
7467625 he deserved that goal because hes been awesome in everything hes done since ive been here
7467626 obama has picked someone who is going to be very aggressive in going after mccain and who is not going to be recalcitrant about it
7467627 if i was mccain id be thinking about my own attack dog
7467628 hes going to want someone who can go toe to toe with biden
7467629 certainly biden was a big choice for obama and it does therefore force mccain to think about a big choice both in terms of debates and the potential demographic or state by state advantages in who he picks for his running mate
7467630 i believe they wanted it a bit more than us in the first half
7467631 when you want to play at the top you must start the game with the right attitude and personality fulham started stronger and were sharper the corner showed that we were not sharp enough the mistake we made on the corner is not excusable
7467632 losing so early in the season puts extra pressure on us
7467633 but i also think it is the best warning that we can be given we cant think we are untouchable i hope we have learnt a lot of things during this defeat if we want to challenge we cannot afford to lose again we have to put more heart in keep focused and play our football
7467634 as soon as we dont play together as soon as we dont put our spirit together we can lose the game that was the case today so these are the things we have to put together once we do we have no reason to lose a game we have lost and now we have something to prove we have to show character and personality and get back our confidence
7467635 the manager has bought some cracking players and were looking like a good squad
7467636 the fulham who can play with composure pass well and be organised and the fulham who can defend with their backs to the wall
7467637 i used to play chess with my husband but he beat me so we dont play any more because we cant find all the pieces
7467638 wherever you put that ball i will put it on the green
7467639 prisoners cant get jobs because of their convictions or even insurance or loans
7467640 in some cases they cant get into countries like the us canada or australia so if they can wipe their record clean by proving that the convictions against them were unjust and flawed why not
7467641 before the innocent children women and men you massacred i appeal to you to do the right thing before god
7467642 i appeal to your hearts and human dignity give yourselves up to justice in this world before you face judgment in the next i also appeal to those who have information which could lead to the arrest and conviction of those who made or planted the omagh bomb you also have a duty before god to give that information immediately to the police
7467643 the families of those killed and the surviving victims have suffered enough help them to receive justice if you have any humanity left in your heart at all do all that you can to ease at least a little of their pain
7467644 the orange order deserves credit for what i believe are sincere and convincing efforts to promote dialogue and understanding these should be acknowledged and reciprocated attacks on orange halls such as those which took place last week around armagh deserve to be unequivocally condemned
7467645 they are symptomatic of a sectarian pathology which is evil and has to be continually challenged in our selves and every aspect of social religious and political life
7467646 a much more honest respectful and constructive dialogue about values in our society
7467647 like the debate within the european union is it fair is it representative of the views and convictions of the majority of the people here in ireland that the media is so dominated by a secular view hostile to or disposed to relegate the value of religion
7467648 is it possible to agree that there are objective values for which we should have serious regard because of their implications for the good of society
7467649 the honesty for example in arguing on the one hand that violence promiscuity and lack of respect in the media has no influence on the attitude values and behaviour of the young when billions is spent on advertising through the media precisely because of its power to influence attitudes and behaviour
7467650 pin their fears tribulations and concerns on paper inside the structure
7467651 this will be a very spiritual event as part of the overall festival
7467652 there were situations where he took it down held players off and won a free kick there were times last season when we were too naive too raw
7467653 i dont think i can shy away from people with different character traits i was no angel if i had a dressing room full of angels then i would be really really concerned trust me
7467654 i think sunderland is a big club but maybe before it had small ideas and ambitions
7467655 there are babies whove been born and are now walking and talking since we started this campaign
7467656 it has been a long pull all of us wish it would be shorter

7467663 it gives immunocorp animal health an owner with strong interest in further investments within the animal health sector and opportunities for continued development of macrogard
7467664 for its part biorigin secures access to a centre of excellence for immune modulating feed supplements and an increased presence in europe for biotec pharmacon the sale opens up for a stronger focus on our bio pharmaceutical activities in other words a further strengthening of our core business development of pharmaceuticals and marine bio chemicals
7467665 our plan is to maintain immunocorp animal healths existing organization and employees in norway while using its structure and technical knowledge to continue to support expansion of the position of biorigin in europe

7467668 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7467669 in the 1990s the gazan fishing industry produced an annual income of around 5m that had halved by 2007 and is still shrinking fast under the oslo accords which in 1993 were supposed to herald the coming of an independent palestinian state gazan fishermen were to be allowed 20 nautical miles out to sea where they could catch sardine as they migrated from the nile delta up towards turkey during the spring but israeli naval ships in recent years have imposed their own much reduced limits sometimes fewer than 6 miles out
7467670 what gives israel the right to take away the livelihood of these fishermen and why does the world allow them to destroy an industry that used to provide for thousands of palestinians
7467671 we intend to challenge that right backed up by warships and machine guns just as we challenged israels right to prevent us from coming here on saturday
7467672 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7467673 the need for respect for the archaeological historical cultural and religious heritage of iraq and for the continued protection of archaeological historical cultural and religious sites museums libraries and monuments
7467674 we reaffirm our commitment to protect iraqs natural resources as the patrimony of the people of iraq which should be used only for their benefit
7467675 it was there in what the greeks called mesopotamia that life as we know it today began there people first began to speculate on philosophy and religion developed concepts of international trade made ideas of beauty into tangible forms and above all developed the skill of writing
7467676 the heirs of a great civilization that contributes to all humanity
7467677 youd have to go back centuries to the mongol invasion of baghdad in 1258 to find looting on this scale
7467678 i thought i was given assurances that sites and museums would be protected

7467691 existen dos imperativos estrat gicos prioritarios en la convenci n
7467692 uno es hacer que la gente se ponga c moda con barack obama el otro es definir la carrera electoral con claridad estableciendo a obama como un factor de cambio y a mccain como continuaci n de las pol ticas de bush tanto a nivel nacional como en el extranjero
7467693 se trata de aclarar la idea de que las elecciones se realizar n entre dos candidatos y dos partidos pol ticos
7467694 no veo la alegr a que suele darse tras unas primarias

7467697 if we perform as we have done over the last few weeks its going to be extremely difficult to beat standard liege
7467698 theyre not a mickey mouse team they won their league and proved in the first leg how good they are
7467699 we realise we have to step it up a level on wednesday but we have won two out of two and long may that continue
7467700 i feel for kenny i think he should be walking away with a gold medal
7467701 the scorings not been very good all the way through but there it was terrible
7467702 zhang was hitting kenny on the arms which is not a scoring shot but the crowd were going mad it wand was they who were effectively pressing the button
7467703 when kenny was hitting him with good clean shots they werent scoring and zhang was touching kenny with little shots and scoring
7467704 i think kenny should have won by three or four points
7467705 i believe that in the first round that i was leading by two points but i think the other three rounds were pretty equal in terms of points
7467706 i believe that in terms of tactics were are similar and we are similar in terms of our skills
7467707 i know some people have advocated the scrapping of the international rules series but i challenge that view
7467708 there is no basis for believing that the recruitment of some of our best young talent would stop if the series ended
7467709 i ask you to wait until gaa director general paraic duffy and i have engaged with the afl officers in october after which we will report back to the ard comhairle and that body will decide on any future strategy
7467710 i have said on many occasions that we have no hold over these players if they wish to travel to australia he continued
7467711 however i remain concerned they are being sold a lifestyle that is not achievable
7467712 it may work out for a player or two but for the majority it will end in failure setanta readers comment of the day
7467713 thats why we have him in an awful lot earlier this year to give us the time to get work into him i read in the paper the other day that katchit is still only on the walker were a good six weeks ahead of them
7467714 there are plenty of opportunities for him and were hoping to run him a lot more this year we might start off in the fighting fifth at newcastle november 29
7467715 if he wins that we might go to kempton for the christmas hurdle which leads us to the million bonus for winning the champion hurdle but theres always punchestown down royal and leopardstown around christmas

7467727 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7467728 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7467729 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7467730 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7467731 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

7467735 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7467736 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7467737 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7467738 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7467739 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

7467742 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7467743 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7467744 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7467745 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7467746 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables

7467751 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
7467752 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7467753 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7467754 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7467755 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7467756 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7467757 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7467758 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas

7467764 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7467765 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7467766 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7467767 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7467768 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7467769 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7467770 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7467771 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7467772 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
7467773 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7467774 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7467775 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7467776 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7467777 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7467778 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7467779 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7467780 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7467781 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio

7467785 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7467786 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7467787 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7467788 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7467789 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7467790 these were men who had been sentenced and found guilty by the supreme court walking around freely
7467791 it was evening around the time for the last prayer when armed men came and took my son islamuddin by force i have eye witness statements from nine people that he was there from that night until now my son has never been seen
7467792 the commander and three of his fighters came and took my wife out of our home and took her to their house about 200 metres away and in front of these witnesses raped her
7467793 there are difficulties were rebuilding institutions including our justice institutions and there are shortcomings but the president and the government are committed to the rule of law on all equally
7467794 theyre in the government karzai the americans the british sit down with them they have impunity theyve become very courageous and can do whatever crimes they like
7467795 weve already lost our son our honour weve sold our land to pay for legal costs and weve lost our home what else can we lose
7467796 you boast about having a high end machine with 1080p high definition output and yet you dont include the video cables to take advantage of that you include very low end cables in fact what gives
7467797 the statistics ive read say that 38 percent of the tvs that were sold this year were high def tvs to me that says 62 percent were not high def theres a fairly high cost of goods to putting a component in the box that may or may not be used were providing the best value we can for consumers the cables that we put in the box will get the ps3 up and running but if you want to optimize it youll need additional cables it depends on what kind of setup you have
7467798 this part is expensive and over 60 of people out there cant use it because they dont have a high def tv it is a better deal for the consumers if we dont make them pay a lot for something they cant use
7467799 if you can find a ps3 anywhere in north america thats been on shelves for more then 5 minutes ill give you 1 200 bucks for it

7467831 when these things get thrown at you you actually try that much harder
7467832 he thaksin is even more adamant now because this is his love and he wants to show people he is really committed
7467833 i asked the question as well as everyone else is the club for sale and he is quite adamant this club is not for sale and he is here for the long haul
7467834 i asked why did you buy it he said he bought it because there is a 10 year plan
7467835 this was a big win for us irrespective of the fact west ham went down to 10 men mark noble was sent off so early i felt we were in control
7467836 there was a real determination in our play and a willingness to ask questions of the opposition
7467837 it was a good all round performance and once we got our noses in front there was only going to be one winner
7467838 i knew he was a good player and you saw that as well
7467839 you always hope that when you introduce someone who hasnt plied their trade in the premier league they will make an instant impact
7467840 vincent has presence an understanding of the game and he recognises danger when those situations occur he nips these things in the bud
7467841 manci cu mine da sa stii ca te vei simti mult mai bine dupa mancarea ridica moralul trust me

7467843 eh ma non sar mia il mio piccolissimo degrado a fare il grande degrado di roma
7467844 i cannot see how key elements in the treaty could be given effect simply by legislation particularly as we have already held a referendum on the whole treaty
7467845 hopefully this matter can be revisited in the days and weeks ahead
7467846 no matter what way it is dressed up or undressed another referendum is not going to work
7467847 attempting or purporting to ratify the lisbon treaty by the oireachtas would be illegitimate and would precipitate a constitutional crisis
7467848 would be an unprecedented breach of faith with the citizens of ireland of a most egregious nature
7467849 the wording put to the people on the june 12th said among other things the state may ratify the treaty of lisbon the people said no if they say no and refuse to give permission to ratify i dont think the government could now go ahead and ratify it or bits of it so i think thats out
7467850 it might have been possible to ratify it without a referendum beforehand i dont know its no longer possible once the people the ultimate repository of sovereignty have spoken
7467851 accordingly lisbon stripped of any potentially constitutional element not already covered by the licence of previous referendums may be passed and it is constitutionally proper that it should be passed by the oireachtas
7467852 thus the oireachtas could ratify lisbon subject to a number of opt outs if necessary those opt outs would cover those elements of lisbon which legal experts determine may raise constitutional issues and may have to be put to the irish people
7467853 such issues may include for example the charter of fundamental rights the solidarity clause transfer of certain matters to qualified majority voting and the inclusion of new competences such as energy security climate change and tourism
7467854 those questions would be put as specific and separate questions to the irish people for their approval
7467855 if approval was not forthcoming on these specific questions then the oireachtas would seek to exercise opt outs in those areas and could proceed to ratify lisbon without those elements forming part of the treaty being ratified by ireland

7467868 she in common with the great majority of international transit passengers is not obliged to pass through new zealand customs processing points provided she elects to remain in the transit areas of the international airport
7467869 transit passengers often have no contact at all with our officers
7467870 while we do have the legal authority to interact with transit passengers we would normally only do so where there was intelligence to indicate a threat was present
7467871 we share intelligence with agencies all around the world but we do not get every drug smuggler or every shipment of contraband that comes our way
7467872 that is a sad fact of life for customs agencies everywhere
7467873 these five rings blue yellow black green and red represent the five parts of the world now encompassed by olympism and ready to compete against each other moreover the six colors including the white background thus combined represent those of all nations without exception it is a true international emblem

7467875 i see young people who are becoming sicker at earlier ages and thats what frightens me because i think they dont know and parents dont know anymore what the right thing is to eat thats the main motivator behind me writing this book is somebody has to say something somebody has to do something kids should not be walking around overweight
7467876 we got to this point because i think parents traded away our own power of making food choices we let these big companies make decisions for us and let their messages tell us what the good choices are we trusted them and we believed them and i think weve been mislead our parents didnt eat this way and their parents before them ate very close to the earth they didnt have a bowl of fruit loops that came from some food company that engineered that food in their laboratory theres something terribly wrong and we need to make changes
7467877 i didnt use to question food like i do now when i was a young mother in my 20s and 30s i just went to the grocery store i bought things i didnt question it the packaged stuff looks pretty exciting when youre a new mom and i have learned to steer clear of that honestly i believe a lot of this trouble were having with obesity and diabetes is because were eating too much of these overly processed foods
7467878 i always say this it takes effort to get yourself in the car even to get dressed to get in the car go to mcdonalds go to the drive thru order the food and wait in line you could save all that time and have your own series of fast food choices in your kitchen yourself there are so many foods that dont take much preparation time at all that are so much better for you its a question of wanting to do it and knowing how i hope the book is a combination of both
7467879 we dont realize when were pouring some heavily processed food into our cereal bowl were not just pouring fruit loops were pouring junk and with so many of these overly processed foods youre also getting what i like to call toxins or chemicals because foods are chemically charged theyre engineered to sit on the shelf for weeks and weeks months at a time sometimes there are a lot of words we cant pronounce that are lurking in our foods that we really have no business eating thats why i call it chemical soup
7467880 my family was kind of my test kitchen i wanted to keep the family favorites and the kid favorites in place chicken nuggets are on everyones table
7467881 clean eating is green eating because the closer you eat to the earth the less packaging there is and the better that is not only for our environment but for ourselves
7467882 you might not be able to adopt every single principle but one one idea just make one change for the health of you and your family thats what i hope to get and if i can convince one person to do that then my job is done if i can convince many then were really going places but i just want people to see dont trust that everything in the grocery store is healthy food even when the labels says healthy

7467900 the russians have a clear plan on how to respond to the missile system but not yet to the georgian situation so the question now is whether they will be tougher on the polish deal in light of the georgian situation
7467901 in washingtons eyes this conflict has proved that russia is not a stable partner to the united states and that it still perceives its international environment as its exclusive area of influence
7467902 most probably they realised that poland needed protection not only against long range missiles but also against medium and short range missiles
7467903 its going to be more than a symbolic but less than a real response
7467904 there will be a set of harsh rhetoric but as usual it will be difficult to separate russian rhetoric from the real action
7467905 they dont want to go into an arms race with the u s but the georgian conflict could change things they might get much tougher
7467906 it could be done cheaply but its not sure the cuban government would go along with it there is no evidence the latin american regimes would cooperate but its a possibility
7467907 there is a growing likelihood of an aggravation of relations we are far from a cold war but we might have very frozen relations

7467974 on average we drink not much more than a gallon of the stuff even after washing and flushing the toilet we consume only about 40 or 50 gallons each but that is just the start it is only when we add in the water needed to grow what we eat and drink that the numbers really begin to soar it takes between 250 and 650 gallons of water to grow a pound of rice that is more water than many households use in a week for just a bag of rice it takes 130 gallons to grow a pound of wheat and 65 gallons for a pound of potatoes and when you start feeding grain to livestock for animal products like meat and milk the numbers become yet more startling it takes 3 000 gallons to grow the feed for enough cow to make one quarter pound hamburger and between 500 and 1 000 gallons for that cow to fill its udders with a quart of milk

7467983 getting a ceasefire stopping hostilities and the troop withdrawal in eight days thats quite a lot already well have to see we have to take stock of the situation
7467984 if it does this russia will further isolate itself from the entire world and will force the international community to seek more active ways to restore the territorial integrity of georgia
7467985 its better to bring them in and allow them to see things from the government point of view rather than lock them out and they criticise without understanding
7467986 unless they are prepared to have themselves held accountable for their writing i dont see how bloggers can equate themselves with professional media

7467988 saving water from field to fork curbing losses and wastage in the food chain
7467989 as much as half of the water used to grow food globally may be lost or wasted
7467990 curbing these losses and improving water productivity provides win win opportunities for farmers business ecosystems and the global hungry
7467991 inefficient harvesting transport storage and packaging make a considerable dent in the potential availability of food additional and significant losses and wastage occur in food processing wholesale retail and in households and other parts of society where food is consumed
7467992 we have banned tehreek e taliban pakistan because of their involvement in a series of suicide attacks
7467993 they themselves have claimed responsibility of several suicide attacks and the government cannot engage in a dialogue with such people
7467994 an official order has been issued to freeze all bank accounts and assets of taliban militants and their organisations
7467995 in general important civilisations start with a rigid and superstitious system gradually relaxed and leading at a certain stage to a period of brilliant genius while the good of the old tradition remains and the evil inherent in its dissolution has not yet developed but as the evil unfolds it leads to anarchy thence inevitably to a new tyranny producing a new synthesis secured by a new system of dogma the doctrine of liberalism is an attempt to escape from endless oscillation the essence of liberalism is an attempt to secure a social order not based on irrational dogma and insuring stability without involving more restraints than are necessary for the preservation of the community whether this attempt can succeed only the future can determine
7467996 today in capitalist and communist society many consider that the only knowledge worth having is that which will help them achieve some economic or bureaucratic goal which they happen to think important
7467997 a man should be aware of the minuteness of himself and his environment in relation to the world in time and space he should see his own age in relation to the past and the future he should be conscious of the vastness of geological epochs and astronomical abysses he should be aware of all this as a vast panorama which enlarges the mind that contemplates it
7467998 self propelling mega machines large scale enterprises faceless governments and other juggernauts of impersonal power represent the greatest threat to our present day world totalitarianism is no more than an extreme expression of this threat
7467999 what is a concentration camp after all but an attempt by utopians to dispose of those elements which dont fit into their utopia
7468000 l dont give any specific advice and i dont fix anything or anyone the most i do is to stimulate now and again
7468001 l try to fling my audiences into the heart of problems that they cant avoid
7468002 i try to push peoples noses into our common wretchedness theatre should remind people that the time is getting on that our situation is bad and that theres no time to lose
7468003 and throwing ourselves repeatedly into the tumult of the world with the intention of making our voices count only in this way do we really become human beings
7468004 it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7468005 weve got our fingers crossed that things will improve but there is the recognition that there is still a long way to go yet
7468006 this is just a transitory period of subdued growth and we will get through the other side and the growth will resume to more normal levels
7468007 this technique is really the first time that cancer surgeons can see structures that are otherwise invisible providing true image guided surgery

7468035 ive heard about a passenger accusing the male bus conductor of molesting a female passenger this bus is still operating at this time
7468036 i have seen the news photos from the guangxi news net i and my friends are more certain that tan was the molestor but the internet photos are not crisp and clear so i will wait for the police to do their investigation
7468037 the public should be able to discover what their public officials are doing
7468038 further the process of transformation even if it brings revolutionary change is likely to be a long one absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new pearl harbor domestic politics and industrial policy will shape the pace and content of transformation as much as the requirements of current missions

7468053 im for it now i think theres a legitimate argument on how you do it im not for having the legislature do it cause i think their plate is full enough frankly
7468054 i think it would be helpful to have a constitutional convention in alabama because i think the debate over a new constitution would raise public understanding our how state government works that is a hope that i have that a debate over elevate interest in how government works how our tax system works and why it works that way i am for a new constitution i endorse a constitutional convention i believe in that
7468055 people distrust the idea of public purpose they distrust that there can be a public purpose thats not contaminated by self interest they distrust the idea that we can have bold enterprises we engage in together as a community or a society they distrust that government can deliver i think the gist of it is refurbishing confidence in public trust ought to be one of the major enterprises of anybody who wants to run for office i think you could talk about that kind of stuff running for governor i think you can talk about the importance of reviving trust in public purpose when you think about it isnt that what obamas campaign is about obamas campaign is about reviving trust in public purpose that is the deep seated meaning of yes we can that we can revive confidence in public purpose
7468056 run on reform and run on progress and talk in a specific way about how youre going to accomplish things and talk about what your goals are for this next decade and if you win youll have the high ground to create change if you lose it means voters arent ready for what you wanted to do and you know what you wouldnt have gotten anything done if you won anyway and youre probably better off losing but if you win it means you will have the high ground to effect change
7468057 you have to prioritze there are 9 or 10 things we need to do at the same time in alabama but a governor cant do those 9 or 10 things at the same time what you hope to do is in that first year to find 2 meaningful agenda items that you can move to fruition same in the 2nd year same in the 3rd year and i think you got to make those agenda items such that they can be leveraged into other things
7468058 78 is the last time that we have known a governor couldnt run again that is the last time that we have known 2 years out that a governor wasnt running and what did we see in 78 by the way we saw an open seat for every constitutional office in alabama and who ended up running that year the names that dominated alabama politics up to and including the present jim folsom got elected to the psc that year don siegelman got elected secretary of state charlie graddick got elected attorney general george mcmillion got elected lt governor fob got elected governor richard shelby got elected to congress all those names have ended up dominating alabama politics for the 32 years since and i wouldnt be surprised if we had an open election for every constitutional office in alabama in 2010 be the first time in 32 years weve had that that by definition will be the narrative of the 2010 election the inevitability of complete sweeping change in alabama politics an introduction of new players and new forces 2010 is a big deal election and i think its going to be fought out differently

7468072 scientists in the department of biology amp biochemistry at the university of bath have started a three year study into the junctions that hold cells together giving insight into how cancer cells can break off and spread to other parts of the body cancer affects one in three people at some point in their lives with most cancer deaths being caused by the development of secondary tumours in other parts of the body this research funded by leading medical charity cancer research uk could help scientists better understand what causes cancer to spread and may suggest new ways it could be treated in the future normal cells are held together by junctions on the cell surface but in some cancers these junctions are lost this makes the cancerous cells more likely to break off and spread tumours to other parts of the body dr andrew chalmers and dr paul whitley both lecturers from the department of biology amp biochemistry are studying how a group of proteins called escrts are involved in the loss of these junctions in kidney and intestine cells
7468073 de zaterdagmiddag leek het meest geschikt om zoiets als de top dertig uit te zenden en wij hadden in die tijd het zaterdagmiddagblok van tien tot twee maar het kwam wel goed uit want bij omroep oost vlaanderen zat ook rudy sinia die van rudys club een echt popprogramma had gemaakt daarvoor had hij ook een paar jonge gasten aangetrokken met name roger troch en ikzelf

7468079 buddy holly is een heilige hij toonde aan de jeugd hoe zich te gedragen de rolling stones en dat soort groepen hebben die houding verbeestachtigd
7468080 als wij in de bladen schrijven of op vergaderingen zeggen dat rocknroll een zottekensspel is dan halen die jonge gasten achter onze rug hun schouders op en lachen ze je uit dat negatieve in onze woorden of geschriften aanvaardt onze huidige jeugd niet meer zij vraagt enkel begrip voor hun leven en een hoger optillen van dat leven wij veroordelen te veel en wij verzorgen te weinig wie veroordeelt moet ook iets kunnen opbouwen het oude zegt de nieuwe jeugd weinig of niets meer er is aan deze jeugd niet veel gegeven of gezegd in een taal die hen aansprak en daarom is zij haar eigen weg gegaan of beter gezegd niet haar eigen weg want jeugd gaat geen eigen wegen maar van de voorbeelden die hen aanspraken mij persoonlijk zegt elvis presley heel weinig maar ik vind wel dat die jongeman zowel in stem als in voordracht de sfeer van de huidige jeugd weergeeft dat gebrokene dat hese in zijn stem het geraffineerde in zijn voordracht en als men daarbij zijn figuur voor ogen heeft dan kan men zich enigszins indenken dat onze huidige jeugd zich daarin weervindt
7468081 och wij hadden daar hoegenaamd geen belangstelling voor maar dat was in feite al een vooruitgang want in de jaren vijftig hebben we werkelijk nog vurige pamfletten geschreven tegen elvis presley en zo

7468083 je bent amper nog maar 16 maar het kan heus niet gaan laat ons nog een tijdje wachten ik doe je nu verdriet en leed maar het kan anders niet
7468084 amper 16 opgenomen het was een goed nummer instrumentaal sterk van de singel zouden een 10 000 exemplaren in vlaanderen verkocht worden
7468085 amper 16 in nederland meer succes al stond het nooit in de hitparades
7468086 bewees even raak te kunnen rocken als de amerikaanse voorbeelden
7468087 wel weet ik van leon lambrechts de ondertussen overleden heistse platenbaas van monopole die honderden platen uitbracht dat er vroeger wel eens geminimaliseerde verkoopscijfers kwamen uit nederland lambrechts hield het best voor mogelijk dat van amper 16 10 000 platen zouden verkocht zijn
7468088 amper 16 leverde geen resultaat op uiteindelijk werd uit nederland gemeld dat het nummer in geen hitlijsten terug te vinden was

7468095 mijn oren zijn opengegaan met radio london want daarvoor moest ik mij b v nog opgeilen met cliff richard in de rudi carrell show de eerste platen die ik anderzijds ooit heb gekocht waren sloop john b van the beach boys en la poup e qui fait non van michel polnareff later zou ik mij echter vooral als verzamelaar van kinks platen ontpoppen aanvankelijk ging ik ook niet naar popconcerten omdat ik in moen woonde een dorp in zuid west vlaanderen dus ver van de beschaafde wereld al passeerden roland boudewijn de groot of jan de wilde daar al eens het heeft geduurd tot krastival vooraleer ik een serieuze groep aan het werk heb gezien dat was dan pink floyd en ondanks nights in white satin of a whiter shade of pale heb ik ook geen herinneringen aan eerste lieven of zo waarmee ik daarop zou hebben gedanst ik vind dat nogal truttig en eigenlijk hou ik helemaal niet van dansen wat misschien wel merkwaardig mag klinken van een disc jockey zoals je ziet de vogeltjesdans was toen al aan mij niet besteed

7468115 chris moyles has hurled his podgy frame into my feud it would have been slightly more credible if the same chris moyles hadnt fawned all over me like a lovesick puppy when we met by chance at gatwick airport earlier this year
7468116 i dont mind you ranting about me on air lardy boy but i suspect your dwindling army of fans would rather see a more consistent and indeed courageous policy when we next come face to face
7468117 if the u s dollar is rising commodities take a hit its been a huge factor
7468118 we may see this rally in the u s dollar continue in the short term but you have to differentiate between speculation and the underlying demand for commodities
7468119 the majority of the increase in commodities over the last five years has been driven by demand from china and the emerging economies being so great that supplies havent been able to keep up
7468120 only the ones who can sense the changes and respond to them can survive
7468121 i myself have personally been agonising what to do to navigate the company our true self shows in tough times i think it is a good opportunity to sharpen our human resources
7468122 it may perhaps allow them to express their views on the proposed takeover a little bit more loudly given that they are a major shareholder
7468123 but as it stands their stake isnt big enough to influence the outcome and i dont think the government is going to allow them to raise their stake from here
7468124 we suspect the government is probably not that keen on it either
7468125 so in essence by allowing chinalco to lift their stake to round about 11 percent of the combined group its basically providing the opportunity that tom albanese of rio can defend any hostile bid

7468136 style should never outweigh function otherwise the workhorse of their home will be all shiny appliances and no muscle power appearances after all arent everything
7468137 sticking with the tried and tested triangle workspace with your sink cooker and fridge freezer at each point is a must if you want to create a functional kitchen
7468138 the choice is endless and it is easy to get carried away with gimmicky features or fork out for expensive appliances that you just wont use to their full potential
7468139 good lighting and the best quality fittings you can afford are also a priority to satisfy both design and function
7468140 playing it safe with cabinet colors and styles pays off in the long term especially when you come to selling your property
7468141 when you are choosing the style of your cabinets keep in mind that contemporary colors and finishes are likely to date fast shiny red colors might be a statement piece now but what about 10 years down the line
7468142 the kitchen is the traditional heart of a family home so the overall design is important if your family is to enjoy spending time there
7468143 kitchen cabinet refacing is the affordable hassle free efficient way to boost your homes value while also realizing the kitchen of your dreams a kitchen cabinet refacing project can do more than just give your kitchen
7468144 what we found is that when men recalled their own offenses they were more likely to empathize and then forgive but they had to do that emotional work first
7468145 when the women started thinking about their own offenses they tended to feel defensive and guilty and that made it harder for them to forgive
7468146 if your brother sins against you go and show him his fault just between the two of you
7468147 lord how many times shall i forgive my brother when he sins against me up to seven times
7468148 i tell you not seven times but seventy seven times
7468149 settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court do it while you are still with him on the way or he may hand you over to the judge and the judge may hand you over to the officer and you may be thrown into prison

7468151 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against public life
7468152 pakistans leadership has clearly stated their commitment to pursuing and eliminating terrorism and securing pakistans borders for the benefit of its own citizens

7468154 the police have systematically denied my client of his rights
7468155 the court has repeatedly ordered them to evict the illegal squatters from his home but they have always come up with some excuse not to fulfil that order maybe being forced to pay a large sum of money will get them to move
7468156 we received it when the original owner defaulted on a loan
7468157 i have interests here but the jewish people have an even greater interest in this case if the courts do not enforce this order it is very likely that this entire area will simply become arab when you lose the ability to enforce the law you lose sovereignty and the jewish people are in danger of having that happen right here in jerusalem
7468158 a police lawyer called me yesterday tuesday and said that the police simply dont have the manpower for the job theyre afraid of riots and soon u s secretary of state condoleeza rice is coming to the region and soon it will be ramadan etc etc but she promised over and over that for sure before the high holidays nearly six weeks from now ed they will do it
7468159 the eviction is a very sensitive on behalf of a jew living in hevron sic he actually lives in kiryat arba ed and the property is located in an arab neighborhood it should also be noted that the eviction was set for approximately a week before the onset of the ramadan month in my estimation the police deployment for the eviction will be very intensive because of the expectation of riots after the eviction and it will lead into the ramadan fasts similarly it will involve the deployment of many policemen on the day on which u s secretary rice is expected which will make it very difficult based on this we ask for a flexible eviction order beginning from oct 5 2008 until feb 1 2009
7468160 but they even want to put it off for several months and how can the police lawyer make a promise to golbert that they will do it before rosh hashanah when the days before rosh hashanah are still in the month of ramadan how can i believe them
7468161 most unfortunately no if the police explain that they cant carry it out then the court will believe them and thats that

7468181 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7468182 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year

7468228 sesungguhnya manusia diciptakan dalam keadaan keluh kesah lagi kikir apabila ia ditimpa kesusahan ia berkeluh kesah dan apabi1a ia mendapat kebaikan ia amat kikir kecuali orang orang yang shalat
7468229 dan dirikanlah shalat sesungguhnya shalat itu dapat mencegah perbuatan keji dan mungkar
7468230 dan orang orang yang berpegang teguh dengan al kitab taurat serta mendirikan shalat akan kami beri pahala karena sesungguhnya kami tidak menyia nyiakan pahala orang yang mengadakan perbaikan

7468237 pondasi segala urusan adalah islam dan tiangnya islam adalah shalat sedangkan yang meninggikan martabatnya adalah jihad fi sabilillah
7468238 sesungguhnya kualitas keislaman seseorang adalah tergantung pada kualitas ibadah shalatnya kecintaan seseorang kepada islam juga tergantung pada kecintaan dalam mengerjakan shalat oleh karena itu kenalilah dirimu sendiri wahai hamba allah takutlah kamu jika nanti menghadap allah azza wa jalla tanpa membawa kualitas keislaman yang baik sebab kualitas keislaman dalam hal ini ditentukan oleh kualitas ibadah shalatmu
7468239 sesungguhnya amal seorang hamba yang pertama kali dihisab pada hari kiamat adalah shalat apabila shalatnya baik maka ia berbahagia dan selamat dan apabila shalatnya rusak maka ia akan celaka dan merugi
7468240 suatu ibadah yang terdiri atas ucapan ucapan dan perbuatan perbuatan tertentu khusus yang dibuka dimulai dengan takbir takbiratul ihram diakhiri ditutup dengan salam dengan syarat syarat tertentu

7468250 adapun seseorang yang membaca dalam hati tanpa menggerakkan lidahnya maka hal itu tidak disebut dengan membaca karena yang disebut dengan membaca adalah dengan melafalkannya di mulut
7468251 adapun selain imam maka disunnahkan baginya untuk tidak mengeraskan suara ketika membaca lafal takbir baik apakah dia sedang menjadi makmum atau ketika shalat sendiri
7468252 demikianlah nash yang dikemukakan syafii dan disepakati oleh para pengikutnya asy syafii berkata dalam al umm hendaklah suaranya bisa didengar sendiri dan orang yang berada disampingnya tidak patut dia menambah volume suara lebih dari ukuran itu
7468253 sesungguhnya shalat seseorang tidak sempurna sebelum dia berwudhu dan melakukan wudhu sesuai ketentuannya kemudian ia mengucapkan allahu akbar
7468254 apabila nabi akan mendirikan shalat beliau berdiri lurus dan mengangkat kedua tangannya kemudian beliau mengucapkan allahu akbar
7468255 hr ibnu majah dishahihkan oleh ibnu khuzaimah dan ibnu hibban
7468256 sesungguhnya nabi muhammad shallallahu alaihi wa sallam apabila akan melaksanakan shalat beliau mengucapkan allahu akbar
7468257 apabila engkau hendak mengerjakan shalat maka sempurnakanlah wudhumu terlebih dahulu kemudian menghadaplah ke arah kiblat lalu ucapkanlah takbiratul ihram
7468258 bahwasanya rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam apabila akan mendirikan shalat beliau mengangkat kedua tangannya sampai sejajar dengan kedua bahunya kemudian beliau mengucapkan takbir
7468259 bahwa ia pernah melihat malik bin huwairits ketika melakukan shalat memulainya dengan bertakbir serta mengangkat kedua tangannya
7468260 saya tidak pernah menjumpai ulama yang berpendapat bahwa takbir itu didahulukan daripada mengangkat tangan
7468261 apabila rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam berdiri hendak shalat beliau mengangkat kedua tangannya hingga setentang dengan kedua bahunya sambil mengucapkan takbir
7468262 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam biasa mengangkat kedua tangannya sejajar telinga setiap kali bertakbir di dalam shalat
7468263 saya melihat rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam ketika hendak shalat beliau mengangkat kedua tangannya sampai sejajar dengan bagian telinga paling bawah demikian juga ketika akan ruku dan bangun dari ruku
7468264 sesungguhnya ia melihat nabi muhammad shallallahu alaihi wa sallam ketika akan shalat beliau mengangkat kedua tangannya sampai kedua ibu jarinya sejajar dengan bagian telinga paling bawah
7468265 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam biasa mengangkat kedua tangannya sejajar bahu jika hendak memulai shalat setiap kali bertakbir untuk ruku dan setiap kali bangkit dari rukunya
7468266 bahwasanya rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam apabila mendirikan shalat beliau mengangkat kedua tangannya sampai sejajar dengan kedua bahunya kemudian beliau
7468267 apabila rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam berdiri hendak shalat beliau mengangkat kedua tangannya hingga setentang dengan kedua bahunya sambil mengucapkan takbir jika akan ruku beliau lakukan pula seperti itu begitu juga ketika hendak bangkit dari ruku
7468268 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam mengangkat kedua tangannya dengan membuka jari jarinya lurus ke atas tidak merenggangkannya dan tidak pula menggengamnya
7468269 bahwasanya nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam apabila hendak melakukan shalat beliau mengangkat tangannya sambil mengembangkan jemarinya
7468270 kami para nabi diperintahkan untuk segera berbuka dan mengakhirkan sahur serta meletakkan tangan kanan pada tangan kiri bersedekap ketika melakukan shalat
7468271 nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam meletakkan tangan kanannya di atas tangan kirinya
7468272 lalu rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam bertakbir kemudian meletakkan tangan kanannya di atas telapak tangan kiri pergelangan tangan kiri atau lengan kirinya
7468273 hr abu dawud nasai ibnu khuzaimah dengan sanad yang shahih dan dishahihkan pula oleh ibnu hibban
7468274 tetapi beliau terkadang menggenggamkan jari jari tangan kanannya pada lengan kirinya
7468275 hr dan daruqutni dengan sanad shahih ini merupakan persoalan yang menjadi perselisihan di kalangan ulama sebabnya ialah ditemukannya banyak hadits yang tidak menjelaskan secara detail mengenai posisi tangan rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam bahkan di dalam kitab kitab hadits bukhari dan muslim hanya ada satu hadits yang menjelaskan secara meyakinkan perihal posisi tangan rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam yaitu hadits yang diriwayatkan oleh imam ibnu khuzaimah namun hadits tersebut ternyata tidak banyak dikutip oleh imam imam besar seperti syafii maliki hanafi dan hambali maka berkembanglah tata cara meletakkan kedua tangan dalam beberapa cara cara ini berdasarkan hadits rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam berikut ini dari ali bin abi thalib radiyallahu anhu ia berkata di antara sunnah dalam shalat adalah meletakkan telapak tangan di bawah pusar
7468276 sanadnya tidak kuat karena abdurrahman bin ishak al wasithi adalah perawi yang matruk
7468277 hadits dhaif diriwayatkan oleh abu dawud dan ibnu hazm dari abdurrahman bin ishak al wasithi
7468278 di antara sikap rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam adalah meletakkan tangan kanan di atas tangan kirinya di bawah pusar
7468279 hadits ini adalah hadits paling kuat dalam babnya yang menerangkan tentang posisi tangan saat shalat
7468280 dia imam ishaq bin rahawaih meletakkan tangan kanan pada punggung tangan kiri di dada
7468281 bahwa ali radhiyallahu anhu ketika bersedekap memegang tangan kirinya dengan tangan kanannya pada daerah antara lengan tangan dengan sikunya di atas pusarnya
7468282 saat shalat nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam menundukkan kepalanya dan memandang tempat sujud dan tatkala beliau memasuki kabah pandangannya tetap kearah tempat sujud sampai beliau keluar kabah
7468283 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam tidak mengalihkan pandangannya dari tempat sujud di dalam shalat
7468284 maka sungguh kami akan memalingkanmu kearah kiblat yang kamu sukai maka palingkanlah mukamu kearah masjidil haram
7468285 jika kalian shalat janganlah menoleh ke kanan atau ke kiri karena allah akan senantiasa menghadapkan wajah nya kepada hamba yang sedang shalat selama ia tidak menoleh ke kanan atau ke kiri
7468286 jumhur ulama mengatakan bawa menoleh yang ringan tidak menyebabkan shalat menjadi rusak
7468287 sesungguhnya nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam membolak balikkan pandangannya ke langit kemudian turunlah ayat mereka adalah orang orang yang khusyu dalam shalat qs 2 lalu beliau menundukkan kepalanya
7468288 hendaklah orang orang berhenti menengadah ke langit ketika sedang shalat atau matanya tidak dikembalikan lagi kepada mereka
7468289 mengapa sekelompok kaum mengangkat pandangan menengadahkan wajah mereka ke langit dalam shalat beliau mengangkat suara sampai beliau berkata akhiri itu semua dan hendaknya turunkan pandangan mereka lihat ke arah sujud
7468290 ulama berbeda pendapat dalam hal mengangkat pandangan ke langit saat berdoa dan bukan ketika shalat menurut syuraih dan ulama lainnya itu dilarang namun mayoritas mereka membolehkannya dan mereka berpendapat langit adalah kiblat atau arah untuk berdoa sebagaimana kabah kiblat dalam shalat mengangkat pandangan ke langit saat berdoa tidak dilarang sebagaimana tidak dilarang mengangkat tangan dalam berdoa
7468291 tidak sempurna shalat seseorang sebelum ia bertakbir mengucapkan pujian mengucapkan kalimat keagungan doa iftiftah dan membaca ayat ayat yang dihafalnya
7468292 hr abu dawud dan hakim disahkan oleh hakim disetujui oleh dzahabi

7468300 ya allah sesungguhnya aku berlindung kepadamu dari godaan syaitan yang terkutuk

7468302 aku berlindung kepada allah dari setan yang terkutuk dari semburannya yang menyebabkn gila dari kesombongannya dan dari hembusannya yang menyebabkan kerusakan akhlaq
7468303 tidak dianggap shalat tidak sah shalatnya bagi yang tidak membaca al fatihah
7468304 hr yakni bukhari muslim abu dawud at tirmidzi an nasa i dan ibnu majah
7468305 sesungguhnya rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam memulai bacaan al fatihahnya dengan bismillah
7468306 sesungguhnya ia pernah ditanya tentang bacaan rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam lalu ummu salamah menyatakan ia putus putuskan membacanya ayat demi ayat seperti
7468307 maksudnya ialah mereka memulai shalatnya dengan bacaan ummul quran sebelum membaca surat surat lain jadi bukan berarti mereka tidak membaca bismillah baik sesudah maupun sebelum
7468308 sesungguhnya ia pernah ditanya tentang bacaan rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam lalu ummu salamah menyatakan ia putus putuskan membacanya ayat demi ayat seperti
7468309 apabila seorang qori pembaca al fatihah mengucapkan amin maka ikutilah karena sesungguhnya malaikat ikut meng amini nya maka barang siapa ucapan amin nya berbarengan dengan ucapan amin para malaikat maka orang tersebut dosa dosanya yang telah lampau diampuni
7468310 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam telah mengajari kami beliau berkata ketika imam membaca
7468311 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam shalat dzuhur dan ashar bersama kami maka pada dua rakaat pertama beliau membaca dua surat dan ummul kitab terkadang beliau juga memperdengarkan kepada kami ayat ayat dan beliau membaca al fatihah saja pada dua rakaat yang terakhir
7468312 sesungguhnya rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam pada waktu shalat dzuhur pada dua rakaat pertama tiap tiap rakaatnya membaca kira kira tiga puluh ayat dan pada dua rakaat terakhir kira kira membaca lima ayat
7468313 dalam satu shalat terkadang nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam membagi satu surah dalam dua rakaat kadang pula surah yang sama dibaca pada rakaat pertama dan kedua
7468314 hr ahmad dan abu yala juga hadits shahih yang dikeluarkan oleh abu dawud dan al baihaqi atau riwayat dari ahmad ibnu khuzaimah dan al hakim disahkan oleh al hakim disetujui oleh ad dzahabi
7468315 terkadang beliau membolehkan membaca dua surah atau lebih dalam satu rakaat
7468316 hr bukhari dan at tirmidzi dinyatakan oleh at tirmidzi sebagai hadits shahih
7468317 nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam biasanya membaca surah dengan jumlah ayat yang berimbang antara rakaat pertama dengan rakaat kedua
7468318 berikanlah setiap surah haknya yaitu dalam setiap rakaat ruku dan sujud
7468319 hr ibnu abi syaibah ahmad dan abdul ghani al maqdisi
7468320 seyogyanya kalian membaca satu surah utuh dalam setiap satu rakaat sehingga rakaat tersebut memperoleh haknya dengan sempurna
7468321 bacalah telitilah dan tartilkan sebagaimana kamu dulu mentartilkan di dunia karena kedudukanmu berada di akhir ayat yang engkau baca
7468322 hr abu dawud dan at tirmidzi dishahihkan oleh at tirmidzi

7468337 ive come in a few times this year in this situation today i was glad the coach had faith in me to send me out i just wanted to get the outs and give the guys a chance to come back and get the win which they did honestly im pretty proud of this win

7468407 das war ein fantastisches rennen mit einer schwierigen strategischen entscheidung in der schlussphase umso sch ner ist es dass wir nun schon zum dritten mal in folge mit einem doppelsieg in der american le mans serie vorsprung durch technik demonstrieren konnten und das gegen sehr starke konkurrenz gl ckwunsch an das gesamte team auch f r den vorzeitigen gewinn der herstellerwertung
7468408 das war eine echte herausforderung f r mich am ende noch einmal fast alle prototypen berholen zu m ssen es hat aber super funktioniert das auto war nach unserem kleinen missgeschick in der box nicht mehr ganz optimal ich musste echt k mpfen unser ingenieur hat mir ber funk gesagt dass ich wirklich alles geben muss das habe ich getan und zum gl ck hat es gereicht
7468409 ich habe lange nicht mehr ein so entschuldigung geiles rennen gesehen wie dieses hier es war unheimlich spannend wir haben gezittert und waren nicht sicher ob wir den sieg nach hause bringen k nnen bei unseren beiden autos wurden zwei verschiedene strategien gefahren klasse dass daraus ein doppelsieg wurde bei emanuele pirro wurde es zum schluss ganz eng er hat versucht die spritspar methode anzuwenden wir sind vollgas gefahren mussten daf r aber noch einmal unter gr n an die box kommen ich widme diesen sieg unseren jungs die diese woche viel gearbeitet haben und uns wieder ein tolles auto hingestellt haben
7468410 das war ein schwieriges rennen weil wir mit dem kraftstoff gepokert haben auf der einen seite war es gut dass wir den letzten tropfen diesel im tank genutzt haben das hat uns erlaubt in der letzten runde noch den zweiten platz zu holen als wir vom gas gehen und kraftstoff sparen mussten war jedoch klar dass wir das rennen nicht mehr gewinnen k nnen das war etwas frustrierend trotzdem freuen wir uns ber das gro artige ergebnis f r audi
7468411 ich habe in meinem stint gelernt wie man richtig kraftstoff spart ich bin mit zwei stufen weniger leistung gefahren das alleine hat jedoch nicht gereicht ich musste das auto sogar in die kurven hinein rollen lassen trotzdem war ich noch in der lage die lm p2 autos hinter mir zu halten mit dem ergebnis bin ich nicht zufrieden weil wir ein schnelles auto hatten wir haben gepokert es aber nicht geschafft ich bin trotzdem zufrieden wie wir die situation gemeistert haben und auch mit meiner leistung genau auf der ziellinie ist mir der kraftstoff ausgegangen unter diesen umst nden zweiter zu werden ist gut
7468412 was f r eine teamleistung nachdem die mannschaft am freitag ein auto bis sp t in die nacht wegen eines besch digten monocoques neu aufgebaut hat auch unsere vier fahrer waren gro artig das ganze team hat einen tollen job gemacht ich bin absolut zufrieden

7468458 bila seseorang sujud hendaklah menyertakan tujuh anggota badannya yaitu wajahnya kedua telapak tangannya kedua lututnya dan kedua kakinya
7468459 beliau bersujud dengan bertumpu pada kedua telapak tangannya dan melebarkannya sama rata

7468466 l uruslah kalian dalam sujud dan jangan kamu menghamparkan kedua lenganmu seperti anjing menghamparkan kakinya
7468467 apabila kamu sujud letakkanlah telapak tanganmu dan angkatlah siku lenganmu

7468469 beliau mengangkat kedua lengannya dari lantai dan menjauhkannya dari lambungnya sehingga warna putih ketiaknya terlihat dari belakang
7468470 bahkan sekiranya anak kambing kecil lewat di sela sela ketiaknya niscaya ia dapat melaluinya

7468484 ketahuilah bahwa aku dilarang membaca al quran dalam ruku dan sujud dalam ruku tadzhimkan agungkanlah rabbmu dan dalam sujud bertasbihlah sucikanlah rabbmu
7468485 mahasuci allah tuhanku yang maha tinggi dan aku sujud dengan memuji mu
7468486 hamba yang paling dekat dekat kepada rabb nya adalah hamba yang bersujud oleh karena itu perbanyaklah doa di dalam sujud
7468487 perbanyaklah doa di dalam sujud karena kemungkinan diterimanya akan lebih
7468488 dan dalam sujud berijtihadlah dengan berdoa maka sewajarnya doa tersebut dikabulkan

7468490 tidak sempurna shalat seseorang hingga dia sujud sampai ruas tulang belakangnya mapan kemudian mengucapkan allahu akbar kemudian bangkit dari sujud sampai duduk dengan tegak
7468491 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam apabila duduk di antara dua sujud beliau melipat kaki kirinya dan mendudukinya serta menegakkan telapak kaki kanannya
7468492 dan nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam menghamparkan kaki beliau yang kiri dan menegakkan kaki yang kanan beliau melarang dari duduknya syaithan

7468512 rasulullah shallallaahu alaihi wa sallam shalat maka bila pada rakaat yang ganjil tidaklah beliau bangkit sampai duduk terlebih dulu dengan lurus
7468513 a ku melihat rasulullah shallallaahu alaihi wa sallam bila sujud meletakkan kedua lututnya sebelum kedua tangannya dan ketika bangkit dari sujud mengangkat kedua tangannya terlebih dahulu sebelum kedua lututnya
7468514 hr abu dawud at tirmidzi ibnu majah ibnu khuzaimah ad darimi ad daruqutni ath thahawi ath thabarani al hadzimi al hakim al baihaqi al baghawi dan ibnu hibban
7468515 bukankah aku telah menyampaikan hadits tentang shalat rasulullah shallallaahu alaihi wa sallam setelah itu ia mencontohkannya ketika mengangkat kepalanya dari sujud yang kedua pada rakaat pertama beliau duduk setelah itu bangun dengan bertumpu pada bumi
7468516 kami mengambil pendapat dari hadits ini maka kami memerintahkan orang yang bangun dari sujud atau duduk dalam shalat untuk bertumpu dengan kedua tangannya secara bersamaan mengikuti sunnah
7468517 kemudian nabi shallallaahu alaihi wa sallam bangkit ke rakaat kedua dengan tangan bertumpu ke tanah

7468564 there are currently very few public transport options available for people in laurencekirk with no direct bus service to aberdeen or dundee

7468578 people might perceive anorexics as vain or selfobsessed but its a debilitating illness that can ruin not only the sufferers life but the lives of their family
7468579 the nhs need to promote more awareness of eating disorders and increase funding

7468614 a leader is best when people barely know he exists not so good when people obey and acclaim him worse when they despise him but of a good leader who talks little when his work is done his aim fulfilled they will say we did it ourselves
7468615 johns a very strong advocate for wayne county agriculture and agriculture in general
7468616 a lot of people are very concerned about how farmers are farming and how their farming practices affect the environment and that kind of thing when in reality farmers are probably the best stewards of our land
7468617 their livelihood depends on good ground and clean water and clean air

7468642 there are babies whove been born and are now walking and talking since we started this campaign
7468643 it has been a long pull all of us wish it would be shorter
7468644 obama has picked someone who is going to be very aggressive in going after mccain and who is not going to be recalcitrant about it
7468645 hes going to want someone who can go toe to toe with biden
7468646 certainly biden was a big choice for obama and it does therefore force mccain to think about a big choice both in terms of debates and the potential demographic or state by state advantages in who he picks for his running mate
7468647 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7468648 will highlight barack obamas life story his commitment to change and the voices of americans calling for a new direction for this country

7468653 but i dont care i have told the mongolian government that i want to buy a piece of land there and move to mongolia i dont mind even giving up my malaysian citizenship and settle down in mongolia so i dont care what they want to do to me
7468654 it is not that im scared it is just that the court case is going on so it would be sub judice for me to talk about the issue plus as the mongolian consel i need to be professional and not simply talk
7468655 what seven or eight people you mean altantuya was not the only one murdered and dumped at that site
7468656 those two utk are assassins their job is to get rid of people and that murder site is the place where they get rid of the bodies by blowing them up

7468693 were making history and the excitement of hearing obama speak and hillary clinton michelle obama joe biden so im just here to rock it this is woodstock for me
7468694 to create an exhibit of democratic history but also to put that history in a national context so we have documents here from george washington thomas jefferson abraham lincoln extending into the 20th century democratic party franklin roosevelt john f kennedy and everything is an original obviously
7468695 so you took the 26 hours from philadelphia to denver

7468707 it is more about him mendis if he bowls a bad ball then punish him and build up pressure on him if you continue to defend him then you know he will also be on top
7468708 it is very important that whenever he bowled a bad bowl we will get runs out of them so that you know he mendis gets under a bit of pressure
7468709 i think s badrinaths effort was great he took on mendis he went for a big shot but that is what you need to do at times to put some pressure on the bowler till now he mendis was never under any sort of pressure so he was bowling at his best
7468710 it is better to have a contributory effort while winning a match but we are not relying on one individual
7468711 if you will have the privilege of getting individual performances like zaheer played well in the last match in this match also he has bowled well but it is always better to win in the sense when it is a team effort and every one enjoys no body had a bad day it is good overall if we can continue to do this way
7468712 when you are playing with a extra batsman you need to score over 250 runs to put pressure on the opposition team
7468713 so we have to see which bowler is bowling well on a particular day and use him hopefully we will not have a day when all our part time bowlers of them bowl badly and then there is pressure on the skipper
7468714 on these sort of wickets we need to click especially the top order batsmen one out of the three or four batmen has to carry the innings and others can rotate around him then only we can achieve big scores in games like this
7468715 well that was the thought but nothing could be done about it when we could score only 237 runs
7468716 there was a bit of worry for us in the middle because we had to use the 5th bowler which was a part time bowler but yuvraj singh bowled well he was turning the ball and that really worked for us
7468717 of course as we saw in this game that if you have a partnership going and then it becomes very difficult to contain the batsmen the outfields are fast
7468718 the ball comes on even if it turns later you can go after the fast bowlers and the spinners so it is very important to have partnership in the middle and save wickets for the death over
7468719 i personally feel that to have a fifth specialist bowler is a luxury
7468720 you can manage with four bowlers provided you have part timers we have seen that part time bowlers like yuvraj singh rohit sharma can bowl raina and virat kohli can also bowl it is always better to play with five bowlers but seeing the conditions and the way we are batting right now it really gets tough to sacrifice that batsman to get some luxury
7468721 there was transformation from that i am playing for the last four years the later half of my career i was under a bit of pressure to take up the responsibility and play through the innings that is what i am doing
7468722 it is good to have a strike rate of over 90 of course 100 plus strike rate is a dream it is good to have a strike rate of 90
7468723 the crowd is very colorful here so it becomes difficult to spot the bowl till the bowl is new you still see it but once it gets mingled up with dirt and all that it becomes very difficult to spot the ball and at times we see the fielders not really reacting or we see a late reaction it is tough
7468724 but you cannot really do anything about it your concentration level has to be up all the time it is very draining but that is what international cricket is all about
7468725 there are two games remaining we will take one game at a time we will play to win we will try to give our 100 per cent then we will accept the result then we will try to rectify our mistakes and shortcoming
7468726 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off

7468757 lewis is an intelligent driver hes absolutely committed to winning every race and he likes to end every session the quickest but i think hes becoming more relaxed and confident in his approach and realising that what really counts is winning the world championship at the end of the year

7468763 im not downplaying the importance of it any time you have a day off youre going to handle your pitching a little bit different anyway but weve gotten to a point in the season where every game is important weve come out of this place with some tough losses i dont think we would have quit or hung our heads that doesnt worry me but it was a great win
7468764 a few of us were talking its probably a lot bigger than just a regular season win given the way these guys are playing theyre trying to catch up to us and theyve got the pitching to do it those guys right now theyre hitting to get down early the way aj burnetts been pitching it could have been a long day but pedey comes out boom

7468768 if we took away womens right to vote wed never have to worry about another democrat president its kind of a pipe dream its a personal fantasy of mine but i dont think its going to happen and it is a good way of making the point that women are voting so stupidly at least single women
7468769 it also makes the point it is kind of embarrassing the democratic party ought to be hanging its head in shame that it has so much difficulty getting men to vote for it

7468785 too ready criminalisation of children and young people for minor offences
7468786 the increased use of pre court summary justice is one of the most important elements in the governments strategy for modernising the criminal justice system
7468787 the implementation of the strategy has received virtually no research inspectoral or parliamentary scrutiny the trend towards pre court summary justice should more incisively be scrutinised to ensure that justice is being meted out fairly and effectively we cannot be wholly confident that this is so
7468788 the greater use of summary powers appears to have resulted in more people being dragged into the criminal justice system
7468789 the best way to avoid a criminal record is not to break the law
7468790 the law abiding majority want to see crimes dealt with effectively and fixed penalty notices and cautions are part of this process

7468807 sort of like us he obama comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care
7468808 the reception is an opportunity for sen clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for sen obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7468809 in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7468810 this campaign is not about barack obama and hillary clinton

7468825 che il gallerista italiano si occupa della vendita trascurando lattivit promozionale degli artisti rappresentati tutto un lavoro di valorizzazione e protezione nelle aste pubbliche che negli altri paesi avviene regolarmente da noi lo si ignora il risultato che tra un buon artista americano o inglese ed uno italiano il rapporto di 50 a 1 nella migliore delle ipotesi

7468831 i myself have personally been agonising what to do to navigate the company our true self shows in tough times i think it is a good opportunity to sharpen our human resources
7468832 i cant say that i ever felt much warmth for either john mccain or barack obama the first struck me as a burned out senate seat warmer term limits oh please term limits who had shown outstanding courage as a young warrior but considerable wrong headedness as a politician a category of persons with which history has after all been well supplied obama i have never seen as anything but a bag of wind possessed of great political guile but steeped in the faddy solipsistic notions of post 1960s college leftism that these two men are much worse than i thought only became apparent to me at the saddleback interviews conducted by baptist minister rick warren in front of 5 000 of his parishioners here the truth came out these are not merely two different specimens of mediocrity as is usual in presidential campaigns they are two different specimens of love the world romantic fantasist

7468842 kyle had the fastest car on the long runs all night
7468843 my only chance to get him was on the restarts
7468844 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad
7468845 he said i just had to look at your rear bumper and decide would you do this to me
7468846 just smoked the back bumper of my car and sent me up the race track
7468847 afterward he said sorry man my car was just faster
7468848 so in my mind i had to ask myself when i went down there in the corner should i lift and brake early and do the best i can or should i just kind of give him a little tap and see what happens thats the way it went and thats the decision i made
7468849 he does that and hell always come back and say hes sorry
7468850 its just his normal fashion thats fine ive grown to know that now
7468851 but we cant give up points when theyre right there for us to take
7468852 he just explained to me that you reap what you sow which i believe
7468853 i explained to him that thats why it happened that way

7468901 es vergonzoso que a pesar del rechazo de los consumidores por los alimentos procedentes de cultivos que suponen un grave riesgo para el medio ambiente la salud y la econom a algunas empresas sigan sin querer garantizar que no utilizan este tipo de ingredientes
7468902 es perfectamente posible optar por los ingredientes no transg nicos mientras empresas como hipp producen alimentos infantiles libres de transg nicos es grave que hero o nestl prefieran mantener una sospechosa pol tica de opacidad en lo relativo a las materias primas empleadas

7468930 asik suruh je banyak sangat kene buat malaslah nanti dah tua taubatlah
7468931 the best employees are being recruited at any given time managers need to make that assumption and create an environment thats going to make them want to stay
7468932 sesungguhnya rasulullah shallallaahu alaihi wa sallam mengajari kami sunnah sunnah jalan jalan petunjuk dan kebenaran dan di antara sunnah sunnah tersebut adalah shalat di masjid yang dikumandangkan adzan di dalamnya
7468933 telah datang kepada nabi shallallaahu alaihi wa sallam seorang lelaki buta kemudian ia berkata wahai rasulullah aku tidak punya orang yang bisa menuntunku ke masjid lalu dia mohon kepada rasulullah shallallaahu alaihi wa sallam agar diberi keringanan dan cukup shalat di rumahnya
7468934 apabila engkau mendengar adzan maka penuhilah seruannya perkenankanlah walaupun dengan jalan merangkak
7468935 barangsiapa mendengar panggilan adzan namun tidak mendatanginya maka tidak ada shalat baginya terkecuali karena udzur yang dibenarkan dalam agama
7468936 barangsiap yang pulang pergi ke masjid maka allah telah mempersiapkan tempatnya di surga setiap ia pergi maupun pulang
7468937 aku mendengar rasulullah shallallaahu alaihi wa sallam bersabda tidaklah berkumpul tiga orang baik di suatu desa maupun di dusun kemudian di sana tidak dilaksanakan shalat berjamaah terkecuali syaitan telah menguasai mereka
7468938 hr ahmad abu dawud an nasai dan lainnya hadits hasan
7468939 saya telah menyebutkan beberapa sebab perbedaan derajat keutamaan orang yang melaksanakan shalat berjamaah dan telah saya pisahkan yang tidak bersangkutan dengan shalat berjamaah
7468940 inilah dua puluh lima sebab sebab dan terdapat banyak dalil yang menyatakan hal ini dalam bentuk perintah atau anjuran ada dua hal lain lagi yang menyangkut shalat jahriyah yaitu
7468941 barangsiapa bangun di waktu malam hari kemudian dia membangunkan isterinya kemudian mereka berdua shalat berjamaah maka mereka berdua akan dicatat sebagai orang yang selalu berdzikir kepada allah
7468942 bahwasanya seorang laki laki masuk masjid sedangkan rasulullah shallallaahu alaihi wa sallam sudah shalat bersama para sahabatnya maka beliau pun bersabda siapa yang mau bersedekah untuk orang ini dan menemaninya shalat
7468943 janganlah kalian melarang para wanita pergi ke masjid dan hendaklah mereka keluar dengan tidak memakai wangi wangian
7468944 wanita yang mana saja yang memakai wangi wangian maka janganlah dia ikut shalat isya berjamaah bersama kami
7468945 wanita yang mana saja yang memakai wangi wangian kemudian dia pergi ke masjid maka shalatnya tidak diterima sehingga dia mandi
7468946 jika salah seorang dari kalian wanita menghadiri mesjid maka janganlah menyentuh wangi wangian
7468947 jangan kamu melarang istri istrimu shalat di masjid namun rumah mereka sebenarnya lebih baik untuk mereka
7468948 shalat seorang wanita di salah satu ruangan rumahnya lebih utama daripada di bagian tengah rumahnya dan shalatnya di kamar pribadi nya lebih utama daripada ruangan lain di rumahnya
7468949 sebaik baik tempat shalat bagi kaum wanita adalah bagian paling dalam tersembunyi dari rumahnya
7468950 bawa tendaku ini kepada abu juham dan bawa kain yang ada pada abu juham karena tadi aku terganggu dalam shalatku
7468951 dalam hadits ini terdapat larangan melihat sesuatu yang dapat membuyarkan konsentrasi atau kekhusuan dan larangan untuk membuat gambar lukisan atau ukiran apapun di tembok tembok masjid yang dapat mengganggu konsentrasi jamaah dalam shalat
7468952 pakaian yang ada gambar atau apapun yang mengganggu dapat merusak shalat
7468953 apabila shalat telah dimulai maka jangan kamu mendatanginya dengan tergesa gesa namun datangilah dengan berjalan dan kamu harus tenang lalu apa pun yang kalian dapatkan bersama imam maka shalatlah dan apa yang kalian tertinggal maka sempurnakanlah
7468954 apabila telah datang penggilan shalat maka datangilah dengan berjalan kaki dan jagalah ketenangan apa yang kamu dapatkan maka shalatlah dan rakaat yang tertinggal olehmu sempurnakanlah
7468955 apabila telah didirikan shalat jangan kalian datangi dengan tergesa gesa
7468956 apabila iqamat telah dikumandangkan janganlah kamu tergesa gesa mengejar shalat akan tetapi hendaknya kamu berjalan saja dengan menjaga ketenangan dan kenyamanan shalatlah seperti apa yang kamu dapati dan lengkapi rakaat yang tertinggal
7468957 jangan kalian lakukan hal itu apabila kalian akan mendatangi shalat berjamaah maka datangilah dengan tenang apa pun yang kamu dapati dari imam kerjakanlah dan apa yang tertinggal sempurnakan
7468958 hikmah yang terkandung dalam ketenangan ketika memenuhi panggilan shalat dan larangan tergesa gesa mengejar shalat adalah bahwa orang yang sengaja berangkat ke masjid untuk menegakkan shalat hendaknya bertindak sopan menjaga etika dan dengan kondisi sesempurna mungkin
7468959 barangsiapa yang berwudhu dan menyempurnakan wudhunya kemudian ia berangkat ke masjid dan mendapati orang orang telah selesai dari shalatnya maka allah memberinya pahala seperti pahala orang yang datang ke masjid lebih dulu dan berjamaah tanpa mengurangi pahala mereka sedikit pun
7468960 hr abu dawud dari abu hurairah radhiyallahu anhu hadits shahih
7468961 hakekat keutamaan berjamaah tergantung dari kesungguhan usaha seseorang untuk menunaikannya tanpa memperlambat diri atau ditunda tunda jika demikian ia tetap mendapatkan pahala berjamaah terlepas apakah sempat bergabung dengan jamaah atau tidak maka siapa saja yang mendapati jamaah shalat tengah tasyahud pahalanya sama seperti jamaah yang shalat dari rakaat pertama adapun urusan pahala atau keutamaan tidaklah diketahui dengan ijtihad jadi sepatutnyalah kita tidak mempedulikan pendapat pendapat yangbertentangan dengan hadits di atas
7468962 apabila kalian datang untuk shalat jamaah dan mendapati kami sedang sujud maka sujudlah dan jangan hitung itu satu rakaat dan barangsiapa yang mendapati satu rakaat maka ia mendapatkan shalat
7468963 jika di antara kalian mendatangi masjid dan menemukan imam dalam kondisi tertentu maka lakukan seperti gerakan yang sedang dilakukan oleh imam
7468964 yang menjadi imam shalat bagi manusia adalah yang paling baik bacaan kitabullahnya al quran al karim bila mereka semua sama kemampuannya dalam membaca al quran maka yang paling banyak pengetahuannya terhadap sunnah
7468965 jamaah di imami oleh yang lebih pandai membaca kitab allah jika sama sama pandai dalam membaca kitab allah maka oleh yang lebih alim tentang sunnah jika sama sama pula maka oleh yang lebih tua
7468966 rahasia diterimanya shalat kamu adalah yang jadi imam seharusnya ulama di antara kalian karena para ulama itu merupakan wakil kalian kepada tuhan kalian
7468967 j adikanlah orang orang yang terpilih di antara kamu sebagai imam karena mereka adalah orang orang perantaraan kamu dengan tuhanmu
7468968 apabila seseorang menjadi imam padahal di belakangnya ada orang orang yang lebih utama daripadanya maka semua mereka dalam kerendahan terus menerus
7468969 janganlah seseorang mengimami seseorang di dalam rumah tangga orang yang di imami itu dan di dalam pemerintahannya
7468970 sebaik baik shaf laki laki adalah yang paling depan dan seburuk buruknya adalah yang paling belakang sebaik baik shaf wanita adalah yang paling belakang dan seburuk buruknya adalah yang paling depan

7468974 ketika abu asid as saidi menjadi pengantin dia mengundang nabi dan sahabat sahabatnya sedang tidak ada yang membuat makanan dan yang menghidangkannya kepada mereka itu kecuali isterinya sendiri dia menghancurkan menumbuk korma dalam suatu tempat yang dibuat dari batu sejak malam hari
7468975 seorang wanita boleh melayani suaminya sendiri bersama orang laki laki yang diundangnya
7468976 aku shalat bersama nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam di suatu malam aku berdiri di samping kirinya lalu nabi memegang bagian belakang kepalaku dan menempatkan aku di sebelah kanannya
7468977 nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam berdiri shalat maghrib lalu aku datang dan berdiri di samping kirinya
7468978 bahwa beliau shalat di belakang rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam bersama seorang yatim sedangkan ummu sulaim berada di belakang mereka
7468979 bahwa aisyah shalat menjadi imam bagi kaum wanita dan beliau berdiri di tengah shaf
7468980 sebaik baik shaf laki laki adalah yang paling pertama dan seburuk buruknya adalah yang terakhir dan sebaik baik shaf wanita adalah yang terakhir dan seburuk buruknya adalah yang paling pertama

7468982 apakah kalian tidak berbaris sebagaimana berbarisnya para malaikat di sisi rabb mereka
7468983 mereka menyempurnakan barisan barisan shaf shaf yang pertama kemudian shaf yang berikutnya dan mereka merapatkan barisan
7468984 barangsiapa yang menutup kekosongan allah akan mengangkat derajatnya dengan hal tersebut dan akan dibangunkan sebuah istana di surga untuknya
7468985 hr abu dawud shahih at targhieb wat tarhieb no 502
7468986 buatlah shaf shaf karena sesungguhnya kalian berbaris sebagaimana barisannya para malaikat
7468987 hr ahmad abu dawud dan nasai shahih at targhieb wat tarhieb no 492
7468988 dahulu rasullullah meluruskan shaf kami sampai seperti meluruskan anak panah hingga beliau memandang kami telah paham apa yang beliau perintahkan kepada kami sampai shaf kami telah rapi pent kemudian suatu hari beliau keluar untuk shalat kemudian beliau berdiri hingga ketika beliau akan bertakbir beliau melihat seseorang yang membusungkan dadanya maka beliau bersabda
7468989 tegakkan luruskan dan rapatkan pent shaf shaf kalian karena sesungguhnya aku melihat kalian dari balik punggungku
7468990 dan salah satu dari kami menempelkan bahunya pada bahu temannya dan kakinya pada kaki temannya
7468991 berdirilah secara bershaf shaf niscaya allah mengokohkan barisan barisanmu persatuan di kalangan umat islam atau jika tidak maka allah akan menjadikan hati hatimu saling berselisih
7468992 adalah nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam apabila telah berdiri di tempatnya untuk shalat tidaklah terus beliau bertakbir sebelum beliau melihat ke kanan dan ke kiri menyuruh manusia menjajarkan bahu mereka seraya bersabda janganlah kamu maju mundur tidak lurus yang menyebabkan maju mundurnya jiwa jiwa kamu
7468993 luruskan shaf shaf kalian karena lurusnya shaf termasuk kesempurnaan shalat
7468994 apabila jamaah shalat tidak melaksanakan sebagaimana yang dilakukan oleh anas dan an numan maka akan selalu ada celah dan ketidaksempurnaan dalam shaf
7468995 tegakkan shaf shaf kalian dan rapatkan bahu bahu kalian dan tutuplah celah celah dan jangan kalian tinggalkan celah untuk syaithan barangsiapa yang menyambung shaf niscaya allah akan menyambungnya dan barangsiapa memutus shaf niscaya allah akan memutuskannya
7468996 sesungguhnya allah dan para malaikatnya bershalawat kepada orang yang menyambung shaf
7468997 sebaik baik kalian adalah yang paling lembut bahunya mau untuk ditempeli bahu saudaranya pent ketika shalat dan tidak ada langkah yang lebih besar pahalanya daripada langkah yang dilakukan seseorang menuju celah pada shaf dan menutupinya
7468998 kalaulah manusia mengetahui apa yang terdapat di adzan dan shaf pertama dari besarnya pahala pent kemudian mereka tidak mendapatkan kecuali dengan diundi maka pastilah mereka telah mengadakan undian dan kalaulah mereka mengetahui apa yang terdapat di sikap selalu didepan pastilah mereka telah mendahuluinya dan kalaulah mereka mereka mengetahui apa yang terdapat di shalat isya dan shalat shubuh dari keuntungan maka pastilah mereka mendatangi keduanya walaupun dengan merayab
7468999 sesungguhnya allah dan para malaikatnya mengucapkan shalawat untuk orang orang yang di shaf pertama dan di shaf shaf yang pertama
7469000 bahwasanya rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam bershalawat kepada shaf pertama tiga kali dan kepada shaf kedua satu kali
7469001 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam memohon ampunan kepada allah subhanahu wa taala untuk shaf pertama tiga kali dan untuk shaf kedua satu kali
7469002 nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam memerintahkan orang yang sebenarnya bisa masuk ke dalam shaf akan tetapi ia tidak melakukan itu dan berdiri sendiri untuk mengulang shalatnya
7469003 hr ahmad abu dawud at tirmidzi ath thayalisi al baihaqi dan inu hazm hadits shahih shaf shaf shalat jamaah telah sempurna maka lazimnya dia akan melakukan salah satu dari 5 hal berikut
7469004 dan sesungguhnya yang demikian itu shalat amatlah berat kecuali bagi orang orang yang khusyu
7469005 maka datanglah sesudah mereka generasi yang jelek yang menyia nyiakan shalat dan memperturutkan hawa nafsunya maka mereka kelak akan menemui kesesatan
7469006 allah allah wahai kaum muslimin peliharalah shalat peliharalah shalat dan bertakwalah kepada allah serta peliharalah para hamba sahaya yang menjadi milikmu
7469007 hr abu dawud 5156 ibnu majah 2689 ahmad 1 78 dan al baihaqi viii 11 dari hadits ali 414
7469008 sesungguhnya karunia pertama yang dicabut allah dari para hamba nya adalah kekhusyuan dalam shalat
7469009 dan khusyu merendahlah semua suara kepada rabb yang maha pemurah maka kamu tidak mendengar melainkan bisikan saja
7469010 di antara tanda tanda kekuasaan nya kamu lihat bumi itu diam tak bergerak dan apabila kami turunkan air di atasnya niscaya ia bergerak dan subur
7469011 kekhusyuan mereka itu berawal dari dalam sanubari lalu terkilas balik ke pandangan mata mereka sehingga mereka menundukkan pandangan mereka dalam shalat
7469012 khusyu artinya tak sedikitpun kita mempermainkan salah satu anggota tubuh kita
7469013 orang orang yang khusyu yaitu orang orang yang meyakini bahwa mereka akan menemui rabb mereka dan bahwa mereka akan kembali kepada nya
7469014 ilmu itu ada dua macam ilmu ungkapan lidah dan ilmu di sanubari adapun ilmu sanubari itulah ilmu yang bermanfaat sedangkan ilmu ungkapan lidah adalah hujah allah atas manusia
7469015 apabila seorang di antaramu sedang shalat sesungguhnya dirinya sedang berkomunikasi dengan allah

7469018 yang dimaksudkan dengan yang terbaik amalannya adalah yang paling ikhlas dan paling benar
7469019 seandainya seorang hamba sesudah berwudhu dengan baik tegak malakukan shalat memuji allah menyanjung nya mensucikan diri nya yang mana itu memang merupakan hak nya mengkonsentrasikan diri hanya mengingat allah maka ia akan keluar dari shalatnya laksana bayi yang baru dilahirkan
7469020 hr muslim 832 dan ahmad iv 112 385 dari hadits amru bin abasah
7469021 sesungguhnya kekhusyuan dalam shalat itu hanya dapat dicapai oleh orang yang mengkonsentrasikan hatinya untuk shalat itu disibukkan oleh shalat hingga tak mengurus yang lainnya sehingga ia lebih mengutamakan shalat dari amalan yang lain
7469022 aku pernah bertanya kepada rasulullah tentang berpalingnya wajah di kala shalat ke arah lain
7469023 hr bukhari 571 abu dawud 910 tirmidzi 589 iii 7 dan lain lain
7469024 s ebab dimakruhkannya berpaling tanpa hajat di kala shalat karena itu dapat mengurangi kekhusyuan dan dapat juga menyebabkan sebagian anggota badan berpaling dari kiblat juga karena shalat itu adalah menghadap allah
7469025 dan rukulah sehingga kamu thumaninah dalam ruku itu lalu tegaklah berdiri sampai kamu thumaninah dalam berdiri dst

7469034 yang dimaksud di situ adalah para malaikat yang datang membawa rahmat dan berkah bukan para malaikat yang mencatat amalan seorang hamba karena mereka yang kedua itu tak pernah berpisah dengan manusia
7469035 janganlah salah seorang di antara kamu shalat kala makanan dihidangkan atau kala menahan buang air
7469036 apabila matahari bersinar terik panas sekali tundalah waktu shalat hingga cuaca dingin karena sesungguhnya panas yang terik itu berasal dari uap narr jahannam

7469123 what takes care of neutralizing dna to allow chromosomes to condense
7469124 did dinoflagellates once have histones and then lost them or did dinoflagellates never have histones and just figured out a different way to fold large amounts of dna into chromosomes

7469126 cations play a very important role in the folding and charge neutralization of dna in all eukaryotes but more so in dinoflagellates
7469127 i find it truly amazing that in all other eukaryotes histones help in this charge neutralization and dinoflagellates constitute the only exception to this nearly universal rule it looks like this may have been the first and very efficient step toward the goal of neutralizing dna long before histones came into play

7469236 the reubenites had 44 760 men ready for military service ablebodied men who could use a bow and who were trained for battle they waged war against the hagarites jetur naphish and nadab they were helped in fighting them and god handed the hagarites and all their allies over to them because they cried out to him during the battle he answered their prayers because they trusted in him they siezed the livestock of the hagarites 50 000 camels 250 000 sheep and 2 000 donkeys they also took 100 000 people captive and many others fell slain because the battle was gods and they occupied the land until the exile

7469261 no you cant think that we do what we do
7469262 zunyi has high levels of industrial activity and serious problems with pollution that need to be dealt with it was decided to embark on this project as the local environmental authorities had very little capacity or skills to handle the problems themselves
7469263 the main focus has been on training the inspectors to do a better job when examining local factories this has involved everything from equipping them with simple measuring instruments to refocusing their attention on the production process as a whole instead of just the pollution that comes out of the pipes
7469264 its about making better use of chemicals saving electricity reducing emissions and generally making the process more effective norway and europe have evolved similarly in their approaches
7469265 the project seems to have succeeded in establishing a relatively good dialogue between the inspectors and factory owners and directors who seem to understand that cleaning up their production processes is not so expensive and can be economically beneficial over time
7469266 those we interviewed didnt believe that any of the 20 inspectors would be able to pass on their knowledge to inspectors in epbs in other towns around the province in an effective way the project was not designed to include train the trainer but we think that it should have been
7469267 our conclusion is that this will be a city level and partially provincial level intervention but with little effect on the central level
7469268 the chinese really seem dedicated to the project even though they had to finance large parts of it themselves this indicates that it is something they find important so im sure it will have a lasting impact in zunyi
7469269 we will just have to cross our fingers and hope that some of the lessons will spread to the other epbs in guizhou and yes pray to higher forces that they will also have some effect on a national level which could happen if one manages to document some concrete environmental results from the project and if we get a proper exit strategy for ensuring that more inspectors are trained
7469270 there is of course a real danger here as some of these factories are state owned with cosy relationships with local administrators and inspectors it is not clear that they will be fined or will care about it
7469271 we didnt receive a satisfactory answer to our questions about penalties for the polluters so there is some reason to doubt the fundamental willingness of the system to carry out measures having said that the beijing olympics have demonstrated that when they want the authorities are willing to make a huge effort to curb pollution but it is questionable whether this applies way out in zunyi
7469272 the actions that have been taken for the olympics are definitely not sustainable if they are to be combined with economic development it is clear that other measures have to be taken
7469273 of course china is in the same situation that we in the north were in a few decades ago with high levels of industrial emissions
7469274 whether they exist or not is largely irrelevant in a world dominated by sound bite driven perceptions
7469275 of course whos going to let a few facts stand in the way of contrary opinion and litigation eh

7469335 one of the major challenges is in providing adequate health care facilities for the growing population of our country there is a shortage of both trained doctors and nurses

7469347 genetic engineering modification gm of green leaf volatile production has important implications for manipulating food
7469348 for example the aroma of virgin olive oil stems from the volatiles synthesized by olives by modifying the activity of enzymes that generate these substances it may be possible to alter the flavour of the resulting oils
7469349 our work shows how you can convert one enzyme to another and more importantly provides the needed information for modifying the glv production in plants
7469350 a notable strength of this manuscript is the combined use of structural and evolutionary biology to draw new insights regarding enzyme function
7469351 these insights led to the striking demonstration that a single amino acid substitution converts one enzyme into another thereby showing how a single point mutation can contribute to the evolution of different biosynthetic pathways
7469352 this begins to answer the long standing question as to how the same starting molecule can be converted into different products by enzymes that look strikingly similar

7469411 as nanotechnology scientists we face a challenge similar to the one faced by structural biologists half a century ago determining the structure with atomic scale precision of a whole range of nanoscale materials
7469412 if we can understand how peptides self assemble at the surface of a nanoparticle we can open up a route towards the design and synthesis of nanoparticles that have complex surfaces these particles could find applications in the biomedical sciences for example to deliver drugs to a particular target in the body or to design sensitive diagnostic tests in the longer term these particles could also find applications in new generations of electronic components
7469413 bionanotechnology holds great promise for the future we may be able to create stronger lighter and more durable materials or new medical applications basic science and techniques for working at the nanoscale are providing the understanding that will permit future such applications of bionanotechnology

7469437 if test results went the other way wed be starting to look again and widening the circle for other products this limits it to what we have been focusing on so it is good news
7469438 the end result is a current information technology system used to identify terrorist threats that has been crippled by technical flaws and a new system that if actually deployed will leave our country more vulnerable than the existing yet flawed system in operation today
7469439 there has been no degradation in the capability to access manage and share terrorist information during the life of the railhead program
7469440 we are headed toward a two tier health system unless something changes we will be rationing care to the elderly the way health care is rationed in canada
7469441 once again we see the dismal failure of government run health care everyone is bickering about reimbursement rates from politicians rather than letting the market set prices for the goods and services
7469442 the texas medical association and other physician lobbying groups would be better served demanding the market set the rates
7469443 when they go along with the premise of government pricing it becomes a battle of the best lobbyists not the rational needs of patients and doctors expressed and priced through the market

7469454 historians ancient and modern have always known what postmodernism professes to have just discovered that any work of history is vulnerable on three counts the fallibility and deficiency of the historical record on which it is based the fallibility and selectivity inherent in the writing of history and the fallibility and subjectivity of the historian
7469455 history will not stay written every age demands a history written from its own standpoint with reference to its own social conditions its thought its beliefs and its acquisitions and thus comprehensible to the men who live in it
7469456 in the common cause of radicalism structuralists and poststructuralists new historicists and deconstructionists have been able to overlook whatever logical incompatibilities there may be between their theories this presents no great problem for deconstructionists who have an infinite tolerance for contradiction and no regard for linear logic like the communists and socialists of an earlier generation they have formed a popular front marching separately to a common goal
7469457 under the impact of postmodernist literary approaches historians are now becoming more aware that their supposedly matter of fact choices of narrative techniques and analytical forms also have implications with social and political ramifications essays on the state of the discipline often have a canonical form all their own first a narrative of the rise of new kinds of history then a long moment for exploring the problems posted by new kinds of history followed by either a jeremiad on the evils of new practices or a celebration of the potential overcoming of all obstacles the literary form that the argument takes has a very strong influence on the way that evidence and arguments are presented

7469468 in coppa speravo di far gol attratto dai tifosi rosanero
7469469 e stato straordinario giocare la prima vera partita davanti al nostro pubblico durante il riscaldamento ho capito quanto sar importante il tifo dei sostenitori rosanero per una squadra che ha cambiato molto come la nostra rispetto alla passata stagione il sostegno della tifoseria essenziale peccato di non essere riusciti a regalarle la prima soddisfazione della stagione ma i primi ad essere delusi siamo noi giocatori perch tenevamo al passaggio del turno in coppa italia nonostante ci la gente ci stata vicina ed ha compreso che in campo abbiamo dato il massimo per recuperare il passivo

7469475 i should have a decision in the next two weeks
7469476 if things continue to develop in the way theyve developed over the last few weeks i dont think it will be close
7469477 that could be the most important debate for a month or two
7469478 they can say weve made some progress in past years but when you look at whats happening in states around us were still not where we could have been with appropriate leadership
7469479 i thought in many ways there were some good aspects to it my point to her and my point to everyone is that had the senate taken our budget it would have been a good session
7469480 thats what kept it from being a good session the budget wasnt as good as the house version of the budget
7469481 they dont want another session like the last one they want us to try to help the governor and they want to stand up to the senate

7469487 this is the latest british wheat harvest in 10 years
7469488 we need good weather this week to assure milling wheat quality particularly hagbury falling number scores
7469489 imported milling wheat could offset temporary shortfalls in domestic supplies he said a spokesman acknowledged that wet weather had significantly delayed the countrys milling wheat harvest but denied that key quality characteristics had been damaged so far
7469490 its too early to tell whether the wet weather will reduce quality
7469491 it could be getting to the point where we do get worried

7469510 the people of kashmir were ready to defy the curfew and carry out the march to protest against indian occupation
7469511 clearly this election can only be fair and free when the media is free and when the election commission is credible and respected as an independent commission we dont have that on both accounts
7469512 this is a lie we dont have powers to remove names under the constitution we dont have such powers
7469513 our base case is the opposition parties still need time to work through all the differences among the different parties in order to form a stronger alliance
7469514 clearly they have chosen the path of arrogance unilateralism thats a serious blow to confidence building in the talks
7469515 it will be bigger than before probably the biggest one but the street can hold up to 35 000

7469536 with this new investment cma cgm has secured a strategic base in tianjin which is the port offering the best prospects of growth in north china
7469537 this will further improve the quality of service offered to our vessels and therefore to our customers
7469538 this contract is a major milestone in constructing the port in an economic climate where the building industry is experiencing a sharp slow down this is great news for essex and the uk in general
7469539 anns house is set into the lakeside mountain below boyes drive and as such the garden is extremely steep it was a huge challenge to establish it
7469540 this is the highest thing any athlete can hope for it has been a very happy experience for me i am proud to bring the somali flag to fly with all of these countries and to stand with the best athletes in the world
7469541 there is no money for facilities or training the war the security the difficulties with food and everything there are just many other internal difficulties to deal with
7469542 when we went back home my friends and i were rounded up and we were told if we did it again we would get killed some of my friends stopped being in sports i had many phone calls threatening me that if i didnt stop running i would get killed lately i do not have these problems i think probably they realized we just wanted to be athletes and were not involved with the government
7469543 the food is not something that is measured and given to us every day
7469544 the stadiums i never thought something like this existed in the world
7469545 the buildings in the city it was all very surprising it will probably take days to finish all the stories we have to tell
7469546 i didnt know what it was when i saw it
7469547 the olympic fire in the stadium everywhere i am it is always up there
7469548 its like the moon i look up wherever i go it is there
7469549 the good thing sports is the one thing which unites all of somalia
7469550 because of us the somali flag is raised among all the other nations flags you cant imagine how proud we were when we were marching in the opening ceremonies with the flag
7469551 despite the difficulties and everything weve had with our country we feel great pride in our accomplishment
7469552 i was happy the people were cheering and encouraging me
7469553 but i would have liked to be cheered because i won not because i needed encouragement
7469554 it kind of nearly led to me not racing this weekend
7469555 it was so bad that i was struggling to basically stand up and so i had to have injections in my neck and take plenty of painkillers
7469556 it depends on the particular circumstances and the particular driver it is possible but in principle i prefer a long term agreement
7469557 we rushed to the hotel foyer to collect autographs ronaldinho ignored all the chinese and walked straight towards me he looked me deep in the eyes took my hand and kissed it i almost fainted
7469558 somebody said in broken english that he was calling on behalf of ronaldinho ronaldinho wanted me to come up to his room
7469559 unfortunately he ronaldinho can not speak much english my spanish and portuguese are appalling and so the conversation consisted of mostly sign language
7469560 the interpreter said that ronaldinho asked if i would like to marry him i was shocked and replied immediately no
7469561 its clearly a strategy to eliminate our members and reverse our majority in parliament
7469562 it would be illegal for anyone to be arrested while they were proceeding to parliament
7469563 we hear that they are also looking for a total of 15 of our members of parliament as part of an evil ploy to rig the elections for parliamentary speaker
7469564 knowing how you are now i couldnt picture you working for a mortgage place
7469565 knowing who i am i cant believe im teaching people to be morally right effort is the name of the game fools

7469583 since we as indians have grown up watching animated films mostly comprising non indian content we continuously seem to be under the influence of these outsourced materials well now we have to start realising the potential that indian art holds for us the indian film market witnesses more that three billion theatre admissions every year and 75 per cent of its revenue comes in from theatrical releases hence there is a huge potential in the domestic market itself which the industry needs to tap
7469584 the animated genre can be targeted at all age groups hence indian content needs expertise in scriptwriting to maintain universality we need to engage people and only a good script clubbed with a fantastic visual identity has the potential to do so once we can master the craft of scripting and visualisation we can create an emotional connect with the audience and once that is created our roi will definitely be huge this is because the audience would want to experience the film again and again
7469585 currently the retail market home video segment and the digital mobile and gaming market are growing at an incomprehensible speed along with this the animation industry is also growing at a rate of 140 per cent per annum furthermore the industry is migrating from the small screen to the big screen its products are now fighting against live action films to capture that same friday release slot in the same multiplexes this means the modules to fully exploit these properties that did not exist earlier are now visible to us as marketers

7469588 it doesnt matter whether john mccain knows his ass from a hole in the ground he was a pow
7469589 hillary clintons support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7469590 an alternative approach which has been called systemwide or macroprudential oversight would broaden the mandate of regulators and supervisors to encompass consideration of potential systemic risks and weaknesses as well
7469591 clearly conceptually it has to be the right answer to have a comprehensive regulatory structure and a comprehensive perspective
7469592 the only counterarguments are practical ones would the fed have enough staff would this broader approach imperil its political independence
7469593 the macroprudential supervisor would recognize that for the system as a whole excessively conservative lending policies could prove counterproductive if they contribute to a weaker economic and credit environment
7469594 in principle such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered and because activities or risk taking not permitted to regulated institutions have a way of migrating to other financial firms or markets

7469601 um n mero apreciado dado o contexto de f rias no qual se realizou o evento
7469602 numa das ltimas etapas do dakar de 2001 tomei finalmente a decis o de contar todas as minhas hist ria em banda desenhada
7469603 wenn der tankr ssel am auto angesetzt ist wird rotes licht angezeigt
7469604 stefano seit wann verwendet ihr bei den boxenstopps keine lollipops mehr und wie funktioniert euer derzeitiges system
7469605 grunds tzlich funktioniert das system so wenn der tankr ssel am auto angesetzt ist wird rotes licht angezeigt zu einem bestimmten zeitpunkt gibt es ein blinklicht nahe beim roten licht das signalisiert dass sich der fahrer bereit machen soll und dann springt das licht auf gr n um sobald der tankr ssel abgezogen wird es sei denn der boxenstopp wird manuell kontrolliert weil zum beispiel ein anderes auto gerade die boxengasse entlang kommt dann muss er das auto blockieren so funktioniert das system wir verwenden es seit vergangenem jahr
7469606 ihr verwendet das system nun schon eine ganze weile werden damit die dinge nicht zu sehr verkompliziert wird damit nicht zu viel spielraum f r potenzielle fehler geschaffen
7469607 das denke ich nicht wenn das licht rot ist dann ist es rot ansonsten ist halt der lollipop unten ich glaube nicht dass wir uns das genauer ansehen m ssen nat rlich m ssen wir sicherstellen dass das system immer funktioniert aber das ist eine andere geschichte
7469608 es gab heute auch mit felipe einen zwischenfall in den boxen was war da los
7469609 wie ihr wisst haben wir als team nicht der fahrer eine strafe daf r erhalten dem fahrer zu fr h die freigabe zum losfahren erteilt zu haben ehrlich gesagt haben wir die situation nicht als gef hrlich eingesch tzt es gab keine blockade niemand musste bremsen felipe war rechts und blieb stehen um den force india durchzulassen aber die fia hat das anders gesehen und das m ssen wir akzeptieren
7469610 in der vergangenheit konnten am samstagmorgen mit dem ersatzauto boxenstopps ge bt werden jetzt gibt es kein ersatzauto mehr hat das eure boxenstopps beeinflusst
7469611 das glaube ich ehrlich gesagt nicht denn wir ben die boxenstopps zu hause beim rennen ist es nicht mehr m glich das stimmt aber darin sehe ich kein problem
7469612 er hat sich eine zehe gebrochen aber es geht ihm gut
7469613 er ist okay er hat sich eine zehe gebrochen aber es geht ihm gut er freut sich dass wir gewonnen haben er hat sogar gesagt dass es ihm sehr leid tut aber es war ja nicht einmal sein fehler so viel zum klima bei uns so sind ferrari leute eben so leidenschaftlich und doch professionell sie wissen dass sie mechaniker sind wir k nnen auf die leute in diesem team sehr stolz sein
7469614 beim ersten boxenstopp habt ihr felipes radkappen entfernt was war der grund daf r
7469615 wir haben das bei beiden autos gemacht um auf der sicheren seite zu sein die bremsen werden hier sehr stark beansprucht also wollten wir kein problem mit dem verschlei und den temperaturen riskieren es war einfach die sicherere variante vor allem angesichts des vorsprungs den wir hatten
7469616 gab es vor kimis motorschaden warnzeigen oder kam alles ganz pl tzlich
7469617 leider hatten wir genau wie zuletzt bei felipe in ungarn keinerlei hinweise wir sahen nur wieder den rauch bei start und ziel wir zerlegen geraden den motor um zu verstehen was die ursache war daher kann ich jetzt noch keine klare antwort geben die jungs arbeiten noch am motor aber es gab keine vorwarnung
7469618 ihr hattet zwei motorsch den in zwei rennen habt ihr ein zuverl ssigkeitsproblem machst du dir sorgen weil felipe auf der motorenmordenden strecke in spa francorchamps schon das zweite rennen mit dem gleichen motor bestreiten muss
7469619 nat rlich ist das ein zustand der uns nicht gut schlafen l sst wenn du bei den rennen nicht ins ziel kommst verlierst du punkte in beiden wm wertungen wir k nnen nur hart arbeiten und versuchen die ursachen f r diese defekte herauszufinden wir m ssen einfach weiterk mpfen denn die performance stimmt jetzt wieder und das ist gro artig einerseits sind wir noch im titelrennen andererseits haben wir einen r ckstand wir werden bis zum ende alles geben
7469620 er ist der weltmeister wir sind ein team und wir unterst tzten nat rlich jedes mitglied des teams
7469621 kimi ist weltmeister aber er steckt in einem tief heute hat er am start einen platz verloren und beim boxenstopp einen fehler gemacht unterst tzt ihr ihn irgendwie damit er sich wieder aus diesem tief rausarbeiten kann
7469622 nat rlich alles ist easy wenn es gut l uft dann klopfen dir alle auf die schulter und sagen dir dass du die nummer eins bist aber wenn es dann mal daneben geht dann bist du schnell der gro e trottel das ist hier nicht der fall er ist der weltmeister wir sind ein team und wir unterst tzten nat rlich jedes mitglied des teams au erdem vertrauen wir kimi hundertprozentig in schwierigen momenten muss das team zusammenhalten wir haben keine zweifel an kimis performance und ich bin mir ziemlich sicher dass er zwischen jetzt und brasilien wieder auf die h he kommen wird
7469623 was stimmt nicht mit kimi er hat am start einen platz verloren und ist beim stopp trotz des roten lichts losgefahren
7469624 wenn du ein fahrer bist dann musst du tief unter die oberfl che schauen und verstehen warum etwas passiert wenn es gut l uft und wenn es schlecht l uft dann musst du das genauso tun ich m chte unterstreichen dass wir zusammenarbeiten m ssen und dass wir verstehen m ssen wie wir uns verbessern k nnen ich bin mir sicher dass kimi voll entschlossen ist und dass wir ihn wieder in topform erleben werden denn er will beweisen dass er ein verdienter weltmeister ist das k nnt ihr mir glauben
7469625 kimi hat gesagt dass er sich mehr auf das qualifying konzentrieren m chte heute kam felipe aber fr her als er zum ersten boxenstopp hatte kimi auch die wahl auf so eine strategie zu setzen
7469626 ja nat rlich wir hatten w hrend der gesamten saison im qualifying immer die normalen diskussionen heute hat man wieder mal gesehen dass man konkurrenzf hig fahren kann wenn man freie fahrt hat wenn du hinter einem konkurrenten bist dann ist es schwieriger nat rlich m ssen wir uns als team das qualifying anschauen
7469627 about three years ago my brother was like tab man if you can make it to the olympics and do your thing there and people see you that opens so many doors
7469628 i figure why not come out here and show them my trends so when i do come out with a fashion line theyll be like oh thats tabia charless stuff thats the whole goal to make it in this aspect this will open so many doors for me
7469629 my boyfriend was like tab go all out why not you never know what can happen
7469630 s o muitos o pessoal do vasco meus familiares e o pessoal de volta redonda que me incentiva muito
7469631 gosto de jogar uma peladinha e futev lei nas horas vagas
7469632 representa o meu futuro aqui que vou conquistar meus objetivos
7469633 quero deixar bem claro que estou trabalhando bastante para chegar ao profissional e dar muitas alegrias torcida vasca na
7469634 the revenge will be shocking and huge surprises are in store
7469635 we will not allow israel and its generals to enjoy stability
7469636 quero sempre jogar e depois de alguns jogos que eu fiz pensei que fosse ser titular com todo respeito aos colegas isso passou pela minha cabe a sim e tenho certeza de que normal para qualquer jogador
7469637 once i thought he might eventually find the way of the leaf he was a gentle boy i think
7469638 eine aktuelle studie konnte zeigen dass sich 2 fr hst ckseier berraschend g nstig auf das abnehmen den bauchumfang und den k rperfettanteil auswirken
7469639 dieser effekt tritt jedoch nur dann auf wenn parallel eine verminderte kalorienzufuhr erfolgt mit 2 eiern und der gewohnten ern hrung lassen sich hingegen keine pfunde abnehmen
7469640 we continued to step up effort to develop innovative businesses in traditional fixed line services we used high quality and bundled services reformed pricing mechanisms and improved customer experience to promote customer loyalty as a result the company achieved good results in its strategic transformation into a broadband communications and multimedia service provider
7469641 i saw you pick your nose and it grossed me out
7469642 we instruct all our candidates to work within the rules
7469643 i have instructed them to administer the code of practice as i say without fear or favour
7469644 when you look at some of the things you say why didnt they pick that up but then you understand that actually theyre not trained or havent the experience to understand
7469645 in most capital cities petrol prices crept higher in the latest week after falling sharply over the past month
7469646 based on trends in the wholesale market the average pump price looks set to consolidate near 1 50 a litre
7469647 the average motorist is now forking out around 209 a month on petrol a saving of around 20 from the highs in mid july but still up 40 a month on a year ago
7469648 fuelwatch wont work wont give the benefits to consumers that its meant to
7469649 if the wholesale price is determined by the big oil companies and they also control many of the outlets its not a level playing field for those small operators those independent operators in the retail sector
7469650 central to our concerns is the fact that the proposal forces retail prices to be locked in for a 24 hour period
7469651 they were long term residents in the bay margaret and ken had been here for over 40 years
7469652 they were your grandmother your grandfather your mum and dad there was nothing pretentious about them
7469653 theres been a fair bit of support for the family whether it be meatballs or letters that sort of thing
7469654 ive been speaking with them regularly over the last few days and considering what theyve gone through theyve got incredible support from the community and family and friends
7469655 clearly the budget intention was to ensure that people on lower incomes were able to access the rebate and thats precisely whats happening
7469656 were thrilled with the uptake of the rebates and the publicity that the announcement in the budget has generated
7469657 while some of the bulk low cost solar companies have not been adversely impacted by the means test our inquiry heard from many solar companies which had lost enormous volumes of business and who had laid off staff
7469658 you ruined my life america now i will destroy your world
7469659 un accordo di cooperazione militare con la russia sarebbe importantissimo per noi
7469660 non c unamerica liberale e una conservatrice non c unamerica nera e una bianca una latina e una asiatica ci sono gli stati uniti damerica
7469661 considering the allegations that have been made concerning an incident said to involve greg bird the club will be standing greg bird down for an indefinite period of time
7469662 the club does not want to prejudge greg until we have had an opportunity to meet with him and his legal counsel face to face however we are mindful that the allegations made by police prosecution at this point in time are extremely serious
7469663 whether to stand him down or sack him were always considerations for the club and the board and the coaching staff
7469664 at this point in time we dont have all the facts and obviously its important that we do have all the facts before any further action is determined
7469665 at this stage the best solution for all parties is that the legal process is allowed to unfold with greg off the field
7469666 i saw a wall of ice coming towards us and then we were carried 200 metres
7469667 there was absolutely no noise it was very disturbing we only had time to swerve to the right before being mowed down
7469668 if the snow melts and this might not happen because were close to the end of the summer its possible that the bodies will come to the surface if that happens well go and get them
7469669 it was a very very fine morning i went outside to see what the weather was like and i saw a line of lights moving up the mountain
7469670 i put on my harness i was ready to go i looked again and i asked myself am i dreaming then i understood
7469671 when i say scene from the apocalypse its because there were a lot of injured it was cold it was dark it was stressful
7469672 we found the first casualty who had a broken leg and after that we found a guide who had three broken vertebrae people with hypothermia people in panic people who had been through something horrific
7469673 they were white from head to foot but they were okay they went back to the shelter
7469674 i saw a wall of ice coming towards us and then we were carried 200 metres
7469675 we vervangen onze statische per keyword quality scores met een systeem dat de kwaliteit van een advertentie evalueert elke keer als het past bij een specifieke zoekactie
7469676 op deze manier gebruikt adwords de meest accurate specifieke en uptodate prestatie informatie die bepaald welke advertentie moet worden laten zien
7469677 i have determined that the undertakings agreed with chinalco are acceptable for protecting the national interest in this matter
7469678 while australia welcomes foreign investment in our economy we will carefully examine national interest issues where these arise in relation to foreign sovereign ownership
7469679 while the firb plays an important advisory role determining whether a proposal is consistent with the national interest is ultimately a matter for the treasurer
7469680 the liberals control the ultimate passage of this through the senate so the question of economic responsibility goes fair and squarely back to them
7469681 he will do the right thing there and we will participate in all negotiations
7469682 in three of those four were awaiting senate inquiry outcomes thats the sensible thing to do
7469683 the governments got its budget and it wants to get it through in the main
7469684 he had a very bad day yesterday and the doctors have now determined the best course of action and theyve decided on using a new drug theyve got to solve some of his problems
7469685 if that doesnt work they said theyd need to perhaps carry out some surgery
7469686 it is a nasty setback but we live in hope yes
7469687 its not good news but anyway i suppose hes done very well to survive the whole thing
7469688 hes doing a good job fighting hes got a very strong will so im pleased with that
7469689 they have a very good reputation and they claim to have equipment in their hospital that we havent yet got in australia
7469690 we zijn nu in afwachting van de terugkoppeling van loncin en zullen verdere actie ondernemen op de ontvangen interesse van chinese autofabrikanten
7469691 ik heb daar wat betreft een tijdsverwachting geen prognose over maar een terugkoppeling zal geen maanden op zich laten wachten
7469692 loncin is een producent van motoren en auto onderdelen geely en great wall zijn beiden autobouwers het zijn dus potentiele klanten in beginsel kan dat natuurlijk
7469693 dat is niet het model dat voor de hand ligt
7469694 het maximum van antonov is in ieder geval 49 omdat chinese ondernemingen in deze gevallen een meerderheidsbelang moeten houden wellicht nemen we zelfs een kleiner belang een stake alleen al is goede waarde voor de aandeelhouders
7469695 we feel the city should be ashamed of this secret prison theyve set up
7469696 ondanks de sterke eerstehalfjaarresultaten en de herhaling van de doelstellingen voor 2008 en de lange termijn bewogen de aandelen niet al te veel
7469697 we zien dat de financials het toch weer redelijk doen nog wat verder omhoog geholpen door de geruchten rond lehman en de korea development bank en dat zette eigenlijk de hele markt aan het eind van de dag nog wat verder in de plus
7469698 we bestuderen een aantal opties en staan open voor alle mogelijkheden waartoe ook een overname van lehman kan behoren
7469699 er was niets in de speech van bernanke om de heersende verwachting dat de rentevoet voorlopig op het huidige niveau blijft aan te passen
7469700 de euro blijft laag zolang de angst voor een verder afzwakkende eurozone blijft bestaan door een dalende olieprijs nemen speculaties toe dat de ecb het rentetarief vervroegd zal verlagen
7469701 it was a tough initiation at the start of the process of realising thats it
7469702 it is very emotional and to have my team mates here today is great and that is what the club is all about and to tell the truth that is what i am going to miss most about the place
7469703 the good times heavily outweigh the bad times and i will be forever indebted to this club and to the game and hopefully i can put back a little bit into the game and this club
7469704 i copped a couple of knocks there i threw a ball to bails chris bailey that was bordering on under 7s pass then i got a knock on it that felt like a cork then i tried to throw another pass and it just snapped when it did actually go i knew i was in a bit of strife
7469705 when i walked across to the sideline i wanted to put my hand up and wave goodbye but it was a bit too early for something like that but i knew i couldnt play next week
7469706 when i went into the sheds i knew i was shot with all these emotions i had a little weep in the corner and then the boys pulled me back around to them and made a circle around and sang the team song and that is definitely something i will never forget
7469707 i see the doctor on wednesday and then book in early next week hopefully i can book in two at once and get my knee done at the same time and get on the road to recovery
7469708 leeds my new club have been great about it and i am still yet to iron out a date when i will go over there but i will get all my physio and recovery done here and then head over there in the new year
7469709 in one way it will freshen me right up so i can go over there and play as well as i can so that is one positive to come out of it
7469710 oh hes talking about x ill never understand why he cares about that
7469711 avril lavigne ok sebenarnya tidak ada elemen yang tidak baik personalitinya lebih baik

7469714 pemuda wilayah akan menghantar semula memorandum kepada pihak kerajaan bagi membantah dan mengutuk sekeras kerasnya kelulusan yang telah diberikan

7469716 ik heb gezocht naar een leider die de stijgende kosten waarmee de werkende klasse te maken heeft begrijpt zei obama toen hij biden de zoon van een autohandelaar introduceerde
7469717 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7469718 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7469719 he comes from a middle class background went to school on scholarships
7469720 hey insert my english first name here how are you doing

7469726 bij ieder interview moest ik nadenken hoe oud ik zogenaamd was
7469727 van een afbouw van het aantal tijdelijke werknemers is dus hoegenaamd geen sprake
7469728 ze maken een enorme hype van onze rivaliteit hopelijk kunnen we aan de verwachtingen voldoen
7469729 ik heb altijd iemand boven me gehad iemand die beter was dan ik dat was een grote drijfveer
7469730 for that reason any new egyptian attempt to mediate the dispute is doomed to failure
7469731 this is primarily due to the fact that cairo doesnt want to see hamas become a successful example of islamic governance in the region
7469732 as it now stands egypt is completely biased towards fatah which itself has a close relationship with israel
7469733 both hamas and pa president mahmoud abbas were elected by the palestinian people in 2006
7469734 egypts national interest requires neutrality and the avoidance of taking sides
7469735 the egyptian government is taking part in the siege and forbidding the entry of material aid into the starving territory

7469754 nat rlich das auto hat unsere st dte komplett ver ndert pl tzlich konnte man weit drau en wohnen und die landschaft wurde zersiedelt aber das auto wird an bedeutung verlieren wir m ssen wegkommen vom l wegkommen von transportmitteln die dem klima schaden und das hei t in der konsequenz unsere st dte werden sich wiederum ver ndern wir erleben gerade einen epochenwechsel
7469755 das liegt vor allem daran dass wir hier in europa und auch in den usa furchtbar lahm sind in unserem denken aber schauen sie sich an was im nahen osten passiert in abu dhabi zum beispiel dort bauen wir gerade masdar die erste co neutrale stadt der welt f r ber 50000 bewohner die verantwortlichen dort sind ungeheuer schlau die warten nicht bis ihnen das l ausgeht die fangen heute damit an f r eine zukunft ohne l zu planen stellen sie sich vor schon 2018 soll die stadt stehen das ist ungef hr so als wollten wir in zehn jahren den mond besiedeln
7469756 wir wissen weiterhin nicht wie wir das hinbekommen werden viele technische l sungen m ssen wir erst noch entwickeln wir brauchen neue intelligente materialien ein neuartiges glas zum beispiel das nicht nur gut isolierend wirkt sondern auch noch wie eine solarzelle funktioniert und energie produziert
7469757 wir m ssen berlegen welche alternativen wir zum auto anbieten k nnen nur so k nnen wir unser ziel erreichen eine stadt die ihren eigenen strom ihr eigenes wasser produziert und ohne fossile brennstoffe auskommt
7469758 ich beobachte schon heute dass es f r viele menschen der gr te luxus ist nicht mit dem auto fahren zu m ssen es ist ein luxus alles zu fu erreichen zu k nnen den obsth ndler den arzt das kino deshalb sind ja die lagen in der innenstadt oft ungeheuer begehrt in london zum beispiel notting hill oder chelsea
7469759 wir m ssen verhindern dass die zersiedelung weiter fortschreitet schon wegen des klimawandels kann es nicht sein dass unser lebensmodell mit den vielen kleinen einfamilienh usern berall kopiert wird deshalb brauchen wir dichte wir brauchen hochh user die ein gr nes menschenfreundliches leben in der h he erm glichen und technisch l sst sich das ja durchaus machen das haben wir in vielen projekten gezeigt denken sie nur an den commerzbank turm in frankfurt viele unserer geb ude sparen energie und sie schaffen ein viel angenehmeres arbeits und wohnklima unsere architektur hat eine technische und eine soziale dimension

7469763 we zijn nu in afwachting van de terugkoppeling van loncin en zullen verdere actie ondernemen op de ontvangen interesse van chinese autofabrikanten
7469764 ik heb daar wat betreft een tijdsverwachting geen prognose over maar een terugkoppeling zal geen maanden op zich laten wachten
7469765 loncin is een producent van motoren en auto onderdelen geely en great wall zijn beiden autobouwers het zijn dus potentiele klanten in beginsel kan dat natuurlijk
7469766 dat is niet het model dat voor de hand ligt
7469767 het maximum van antonov is in ieder geval 49 omdat chinese ondernemingen in deze gevallen een meerderheidsbelang moeten houden wellicht nemen we zelfs een kleiner belang een stake alleen al is goede waarde voor de aandeelhouders
7469768 ondanks de sterke eerstehalfjaarresultaten en de herhaling van de doelstellingen voor 2008 en de lange termijn bewogen de aandelen niet al te veel
7469769 we zien dat de financials het toch weer redelijk doen nog wat verder omhoog geholpen door de geruchten rond lehman en de korea development bank en dat zette eigenlijk de hele markt aan het eind van de dag nog wat verder in de plus
7469770 we bestuderen een aantal opties en staan open voor alle mogelijkheden waartoe ook een overname van lehman kan behoren

7469779 to anyone who really believed barack obamas candidacy represented hope and change the selection of joe biden as his running mate should put that illusion to rest antiwar activists point to bidens vote in favor of authorizing bush to go to war with iraq but even worse was his behavior in the run up to the invasion today he wails that he didnt know that nobody knew the truth about iraqs alleged weapons of mass destruction but it cannot be said that biden was all that eager to discover the truth either as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee in 2002 biden was in a position to ensure that a real debate took place on the issue yet in the hearings held by his committee not a single antiwar expert was called all were spear carriers for the war party biden was chosen for the number two spot because he is thought to strengthen the obama campaign in the area of foreign policy where the candidate is considered weakest biden is presented as a man of experience and a foreign policy maven to boot however it is precisely in the realm of foreign policy that biden falls far short

7469781 many developers used to spend money lavishly now it is time to rethink expenses
7469782 big developers like us can afford bulk buying and cut costs
7469783 when you set up a company employees become part of your growth you cannot penalise staff in bad times but we can certainly cut overheads
7469784 instead of three years we can finish projects in two and a half years and save time and overheads instead of firing employees putting a little pressure on them to finish the projects early makes sense
7469785 we buy land only if price is right and has good potential to develop
7469786 we have scaled back some of our new projects and have become cautious about making new commitments

7469811 there are safety and security issues in just about every country in the world that we play with the exception of new zealand
7469812 professional risk assessment says the risk is acceptable in some of those places unfortunately at the moment its not acceptable in pakistan
7469813 what were all desperately hoping now is the situation in pakistan settles down and allows us to go back there next year we havent had a senior australian team in pakistan for a long time
7469814 basically the safety and security advice weve got about india is completely different to the safety and security advice weve got about pakistan
7469815 its simple if the expert advice says its safe we go and were happy to recommend to players that we go
7469816 if the safety and security advice says its not safe then we dont go and our track record speaks for itself on that front
7469817 we really hope the situation in pakistan improves to the extent where they can tour
7469818 hopefully i will be playing cricket for a few more years to come so i am pretty sure i will get the opportunity to go and play cricket in pakistan
7469819 i think my view has been all the time that the icc cricket australia and the aca australian cricketers association would make a decision and they have finally done that

7469844 i look back at 2004 and im so proud right now
7469845 that person will have a structure that jerry and all these people have built
7469846 i think the greatest part of the continuity should be jerry and the players the ones who still feel like they can give that type of commitment
7469847 the young guys coming up that want to be a part of this make sure you have the right mind set
7469848 thats be unselfish with everything its not about you shining its about the team shining

7469855 no conduct is possible without knowledge without conduct theres no liberation and without liberation no deliverance
7469856 the whole process of evolution for the spirit is an awakening to the truths and the means of implementation of those truths that are eternally present in itself what was implicit has to become explicit when you discover for yourself however dimly that you are rooted in something that is infinitely vast and potential you have found the soil wherein you grow unconsciously into a most wonderful tree the tree of life blended with knowledge
7469857 only that science is a great and the best of all sciences the study of which frees man from all kinds of miseries
7469858 mahaviras teaching about the law of karma was similar to the other saints of indian traditions jain dharma recognizes nonviolence as the highest dharma duty
7469859 progress whether for individuals groups or the whole of humanity is by decisive choices made from time to time forced by the development of a situation which as it mounts up calls for its own resolution life in matter is a series of crises and resolutions
7469860 the greatest mistake of a soul is non recognition of its real self and this is only rectified by recognising itself
7469861 the enlightened should contemplate that his soul is endowed with boundless energy whatever is the supreme soul so am i whatever is my essential nature is the essence of supreme soul therefore i am fitted for meditating on my inner supreme soul none other

7469874 clearly the budget intention was to ensure that people on lower incomes were able to access the rebate and thats precisely whats happening
7469875 were thrilled with the uptake of the rebates and the publicity that the announcement in the budget has generated
7469876 while some of the bulk low cost solar companies have not been adversely impacted by the means test our inquiry heard from many solar companies which had lost enormous volumes of business and who had laid off staff
7469877 the liberals control the ultimate passage of this through the senate so the question of economic responsibility goes fair and squarely back to them
7469878 he will do the right thing there and we will participate in all negotiations
7469879 in three of those four were awaiting senate inquiry outcomes thats the sensible thing to do
7469880 the governments got its budget and it wants to get it through in the main
7469881 if you take billions of us dollars out of it then youve got to be able to say where you would elsewise get that money
7469882 the liberals control the ultimate passage of this through the senate so the question of economic responsibility goes fair and squarely back to them
7469883 he will do the right thing there and we will participate in all negotiations
7469884 in three of those four were awaiting senate inquiry outcomes thats the sensible thing to do
7469885 the governments got its budget and it wants to get it through in the main
7469886 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
7469887 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours
7469888 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7469889 we believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant

7469891 coal will continue to play a large and indispensable role in a greenhouse gas constrained world
7469892 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7469893 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7469894 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7469895 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7469896 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7469897 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7469898 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7469899 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7469900 make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
7469901 right after the conflict with georgia russia would look very indecent if it immediately annexed south ossetia and abkhazia
7469902 russia will be perfectly content if they are pseudo independent states
7469903 when you look at some of the things you say why didnt they pick that up but then you understand that actually theyre not trained or havent the experience to understand
7469904 typical of the pro obama dungeons amp dragons crowd from the comfort of moms basement
7469905 naturally gamers are not amused by the mccain campaigns quick resort to 80s era cultural stereotypes once mccain masters the internet were confident hell contemporize and start bashing video gamers instead
7469906 wields a fox cloak of deception with a 10 stun against nearby intelligent creatures
7469907 suggests that battle for the presidency between the illinois senator and republican rival john mccain is all tied up
7469908 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7469909 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7469910 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7469911 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7469912 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7469913 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7469914 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7469915 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7469916 the systems that generate elections and earthquakes are complex systems
7469917 they are not predictable by simple equations but after coarse graining averaging they become predictable
7469918 we didnt look at it as reagan versus carter or republicans versus democrats or liberals versus conservatives rather we looked at elections as stability versus upheavals
7469919 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7469920 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7469921 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7469922 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7469923 concerned about someone googling someones name and being able to access it later
7469924 it will have to be taken into account this is a very interesting development from the point of view of our project
7469925 concerned about someone googling someones name and being able to access it later
7469926 clearly the budget intention was to ensure that people on lower incomes were able to access the rebate and thats precisely whats happening
7469927 were thrilled with the uptake of the rebates and the publicity that the announcement in the budget has generated
7469928 while some of the bulk low cost solar companies have not been adversely impacted by the means test our inquiry heard from many solar companies which had lost enormous volumes of business and who had laid off staff
7469929 for each 8 000 rebate we are now getting on average units that produce 20 per cent less energy and that save less greenhouse emissions
7469930 really excited to see the football games and meet new people
7469931 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7469932 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7469933 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7469934 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7469935 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7469936 government is like a big baby an alimentary canal with a big appetite at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other
7469937 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7469938 i dont know if you are aware that i am a decorated vietnam war veteran
7469939 except in three cases that of their wives their daughters and their girlfriends
7469940 nancy unwilling to stand up for womens pro choice beliefs
7469941 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7469942 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7469943 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7469944 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7469945 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7469946 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7469947 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7469948 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7469949 make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
7469950 right after the conflict with georgia russia would look very indecent if it immediately annexed south ossetia and abkhazia
7469951 russia will be perfectly content if they are pseudo independent states
7469952 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7469953 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7469954 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7469955 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7469956 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7469957 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7469958 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7469959 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7469960 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7469961 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7469962 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
