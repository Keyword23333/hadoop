3070004 we got 99 percent of our energy from the middle east today it is zero
3070005 i have observed that in all other countries including in america people are complaining about how prices of gasoline are going up
3070006 the cure is not to reduce the price but on the contrary to raise it even higher to break our addiction to oil we are going to introduce a new tax reform in the direction of even higher taxation on energy and the revenue generated on that will be used to cut taxes on personal income so we will improve incentives to work and improve incentives to save energy and develop renewable energy
3070007 weve had 35 new competitors coming out of china in the last 18 months

3070010 i ask you maribel looking you in the eyes who gave you the substance and where did you buy it
3070011 when bolt ran 9 72 i realised that i had to run a 9 6 to beat him and thats what i trained my mind to do
3070012 the record can go and the guys can go 9 6
3070013 i did it with a lot of wind but i feel i can go there without wind this is one of the hottest 100s in history there hasnt been as much hype about it for a long time
3070014 thats just something im doing to show my love for the sport
3070015 i definitely understand that comes with the territory past champions have tested positive for drugs so the olympic champion does have to carry himself clean or should be clean and definitely able to prove it
3070016 i dont feel any aches or twitches ive been staying hydrated and im confident my body will hold up
3070017 i would have to say that bolt would be the favourite people may say he lacks experience at 100m but running 9 76 and 9 72 trumps experience tyson was in the shape of his life earlier this year but i think its going to be tough for him to come in and run the time he needs after a month off but that is not to say he cant win it
3070018 powell has shown it is very difficult for him to get it done on the days when it really counts
3070019 it would be devastating if that happened to him again so i think hes going to have a tremendous amount of pressure on him
3070020 we are celebrating the work done with autodesk maya over the past 10 years by many artists and creative visionaries in film television production and games as well as in industrial design and architecture
3070021 we designed maya 2009 as a tribute to creative innovation and production efficiency the new release will allow artists to raise the bar and deliver even more ground breaking computer graphics work
3070022 the future of maya is shining brightly with the upcoming release
3070023 autodesk maya 2009 will change the way artists think about dynamics rendering compositing and pipelines with the solid mental ray multi render pass workflow production will be far more effective this new workflow will optimize render times for multiple render layers and in turn elevate the quality of work the creation of nparticles builds on the unified dynamics engine introduced in ncloth allowing for greater integration of advanced effects
3070024 autodesk motionbuilder 2009 is one of the most significant releases of the software since its inception
3070025 this version includes improved workflows for technical directors as well as an increased focus on interactivity with capture simulation and high quality rendering in real time it lets animators be more productive and puts total creative control into the hands of directors and cinematographers
3070026 autodesk motionbuilder has long been one of the most powerful and reliable character animation tools on the market both for keyframing and motion capture processing
3070027 as an animator i love the new rigid body physics and rag doll solvers in the 2009 version which help to perfect a multitude of movements that would otherwise be quite painful to capture realistically technical directors will also be happy to see the new python script editor and ability to create custom uis which will allow them to fully integrate motionbuilder into pipelines like ours

3070129 hes really built this team into what it is today

3070134 as a result of being on welfare i have personally experienced the many pitfalls and the hurts that are felt at those times the constant fear of being removed from public assistance and of not being able to stand without that crutch forced me to dig deep inside and pull every ounce of fortitude just to survive surviving that experience has helped me to help others get off the merry go round to dig for dignity and to feel comfortable in sharing their experiences i came to do a job and that job is with whomever and whatever my hands find to work with i must take it and make whatever i need to move on in this life looking for a better world

3070139 we will conclude that 1 california statutes permit home schooling as a species of private school education and 2 the statutory permission to home school may constitutionally be overridden in order to protect the safety of a child who has been declared dependent
3070140 although the legislature did not amend the statutory scheme so as to expressly permit home schooling more recent enactments demonstrate an apparent acceptance by the legislature of the proposition that home schooling is taking place in california with home schools allowed as private schools recent statutes indicate that the legislature is aware that some parents in california home school their children by declaring their homes to be private schools moreover several statutory enactments indicate a legislative approval of home schooling by exempting home schools from requirements otherwise applicable to private schools
3070141 while the legislative history of education code section 44237 is somewhat complicated it confirms this interpretation and also reflects the legislature s apparent intent to accommodate home schooling parents
3070142 while the interpretation of the private school exemption is ultimately an issue for the courts we find it significant that education and enforcement officials at both the state and local levels agree that home schools may constitute private schools

3070501 this suggests that people with diabetes might want to avoid coffee and other caffeinated beverages so that this exaggeration doesnt occur they may find that its easier for them to keep their glucose down if they avoid caffeine
3070502 if i dont win any awards but the sec championship thats good enough for me
3070503 last year for the most part that was everybodys first time being in big situations being in the close games being behind

3070509 if we do that winning a national championship will take care of itself i think the hardest thing to do in college football is to win the sec championship

3070632 it was a problem trying to find swimming baths in the area in which to train in those days particularly ones that were big enough
3070633 she would swim in the taff race in roath park lake but im not sure how she managed it really
3070634 there certainly would not have been any lanes or starting blocks it would have been easy to get lost in a large olympic pool you would never have swum in before
3070635 we do know however that she used to be a breast stroke swimmer but a coach advised her to convert to freestyle about three or four years before the olympics he must have seen her talent in that stroke
3070636 unlike the olympics today when they arrive weeks ahead to help athletes prepare the british team arrived in stockholm just in time for the games

3070643 but it was difficult in a different way for my grandmother nothing was laid on for you i dont think they got the help they have now and the training they did was limited

3070666 come tutte le cose belle questi giorni sono terminati porto con me un tesoro di ricordi
3070667 nei momenti difficili dio ci porge la mano e chiede a noi di porgerla al prossimo nel bisogno

3070675 our primary focus in designing and implementing policies must be the actual needs of all children affected by hiv aids not whether they meet an agencys definition of orphan
3070676 civil society organizations and faith groups provide most of the available support
3070677 but small localized projects can only take us so far
3070678 strengthening the capacity of families through systematic public sector initiatives has been identified globally as one of the most important strategies in building an effective response for children
3070679 every developing country no matter how poor can afford a social protection package for children affected by hiv and extreme poverty
3070680 putting needed resources into the hands of affected families should be urgently considered in order to expand the impact of small scale programmes currently reaching only very small numbers of children
3070681 in many high prevalence countries in africa poverty is arguably the single biggest barrier to the scale up of hiv treatment and prevention
3070682 the tabloids and tv make it seem like its not normal that your body looks different after youve had a baby

3070684 wil armstrong is a career businessman not a career politician
3070685 it is that real world experience that washington so desperately needs today he has dealt with complex business situations and forged solutions during both the highs and lows of an unstable economy
3070686 leaders across the board all realize that we need to do something different in washington and we need to change politics as usual and wil is the right guy to do that
3070687 this is a trend we were hearing about even before talk of a recession really started
3070688 gen y students look to their parents for advice and support and this is just another example of a trend with this generation
3070689 during that time everybody wanted to own a mobile phone but it was not common to find them in this country
3070690 sometimes i am in bed and a customer will call me and i will go and pick him up
3070691 there is nobody in ghana who is not using a mobile phone
3070692 previously there were just simply no telephones or there would be a few phones around
3070693 now telephones are available for the masses which is a relatively recent innovation in africa
3070694 i think there is something quite fascinating going on here

3070697 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3070698 there is an immediate and pressing need to end the fighting and disengage all military forces in south ossetia the georgian government has offered a ceasefire which i urge the russians to reciprocate without delay

3070708 concept of social media and the concept of community are often used interchangeably and they are not the same thing she says that social media can help foster communities but it is limited to a conversation around content social media are the tools that the community can use for its networking and conversation and relationship building or put more succinctly rachel goes on to identify specific characteristics of an online community in her post much as how nancy white has defined a traditional online community she ends with two possible approaches 1 to use social media to enable conversations and get a better idea of how constituents respond to specific content initiatives goals this is much easier both to understand and implement 2 to create communities that extend their capabilities and engage their constituents in richer ways that results in higher retention lower risk increased roi and faster operational capacity communities have enormous strategic benefits to companies but require considerable investment in resources time and tools and are difficult to implement because they have a significant impact on business processes rachels post and we had a bit of email back and forth where she further clarified the difference i equate option 1 with having a bunch of people watching a movie together and then chatting about it afterward option 2 or a community is more like your local pub or church where when you go you dont necessarily run into all the people in the community and there may be new people but in general you see the same faces and develop relationships with the regular visitors those two different things require a very different level of commitment spending resources etc both are valuable but they have different purposes and pay off i asked her if she had grid which outlined the differences she sent me the graphic above and also spelled out the do you really need an online community or something else

3070716 children dont return to a home after school they return to a house with electronic appliances
3070717 they fill the absence of what makes a home with an alternative world constructed by entertainment when they come together it is this world of entertainment that forms their relationships from the clothes in which they choose to appear to each other usually in amazing conformism to the group to the love relationships they develop

3070837 because of the breadth of microchips analog and digital components from basic op amps to temperature sensors to sophisticated mcus and their superior levels of technical support we are compelled to use their products additionally as power density continues to climb we are forced to consolidate the housekeeping functionality required by a converter into one device that can manage these features microchips pic mcu op amp and related support allow us to do all of this in a timely flexible and cost effective manner
3070838 bel power requires global logistical support for multiple design and manufacturing locations microchip consistently delivers technical and sales support to our facilities in the u s as well as in china

3070842 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3070843 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3070844 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3070845 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3070846 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3070847 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3070880 there is a significant need in biology to be able to image at high resolution
3070881 metamaterials would be a better optical imaging method since it would be non invasive
3070882 in the case of such cloaks or shields the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock
3070883 an observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it making it seem to disappear
3070884 to scale up such a material to sizes visible to the naked eye will be very time consuming and very costly
3070885 the fish net structure is counter intuitive because as we stack the material in layers the energy loss is reduced instead of increased

3070888 we felt like the audit gave us a good blueprint to follow and didnt feel like any additional studies were warranted this year

3070894 the grande boucle has often started outside of france and in 2009 we want to start in britain in honour of nicole cooke
3070895 nicoles a great rider and i was really sorry she didnt win the grande boucle this year but i was really happy she won the gold medal in beijing
3070896 weve been planning the british start for at least a year we had talks with london after they hosted the tour de france depart last year but unfortunately it didnt happen however the race will still start in britain and ive just sent out letters to a lot of town that might be interested in the hosting the grand depart and then a stage start of finish
3070897 it would be good to start in wales close to nicoles home town and then head to the coast perhaps portsmouth or even brighton ive already talked to bbc wales and theyre interested and nicole has told me she will help promote the race in britain weve going to have a big gala the day before the start to celebrate womens cycling and then two road stages the 2009 grand boucle will then pass through france and will end in bilbao in the basque country of northern spain

3070900 als wir madsen holten war uns klar dass wir ein strukturelles problem hatten das wir beheben wollten aber dann kamen die erfolgreichen europameisterschaften 2006 mit 27 medaillen und zw lf titeln und wie soll jemand von nderungen berzeugt werden der gerade erfolg hatte das war ein positiver unfall f r den wir nun bezahlen mussten

3070902 the company could declare force majeure on its exports from the two ports
3070903 i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world
3070904 actually we dont disagree as much as youd think i think people assume im a democrat but im registered independent and im still undecided so im looking at mccain as well as obama
3070905 we were informed by the authorities that on the behest of daw suu they are allowing her a meeting with the lawyer it was their governments arrangement and the meeting went on for two hours
3070906 we are not sure how significant the meeting is but daw suu has handed over to kyi win the power to conduct any legal activities on her behalf and we believe there could be another meeting but we are not sure when and how
3070907 we do not have any such information kyi win did not mention anything about it and we are unaware of it
3070908 in earlier years by this time we registered full bookings but this year we have got only a few bookings despite the promotion
3070909 in previous years our cars were fully booked until december this year we do not have bookings even for next month the car renting business is slowing down
3070910 but now we have to worry about the lack of earning this season
3070911 there are almost no reservations at all in previous years our hotels occupancy rate was full till november
3070912 we dare not book either hotels or cars we have had three to four cancellations we dont know what will happen next we hope the situation will normalize
3070913 in previous years around this time we got assignments for tours now there is almost no work till today and i cant say what i will do in future
3070914 some tour guides have already shifted to other works including working at ngos
3070915 we had no holidays in 2006 will full assignments and were on tour all the month now we havent yet got any assignment
3070916 the situation is not good this year im considering shifting to another work
3070917 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull

3070920 we do for sure but we also need a bigger squad to finish seventh sixth fifth in the league
3070921 if we sign a few more players we will be a better and stronger team and so then we will have no choice but to try to finish higher and i feel we can do that
3070922 when you see the top four you see not just the best players in england but also some of the best players in the world
3070923 one of the main reasons they able to get them is money what they can spend in transfer fees and in wages
3070924 they also have the biggest squads you need to compete successfully in four competitions that is something the other clubs currently dont have
3070925 we already have great players in the squad david james sol campbell peter crouch all internationals but we would always welcome more anything to make the squad stronger
3070926 we know what we can both do and our record is quite good when you are talking about goals
3070927 it is still early days but we are kicking off next week with the game against chelsea and we can take a lot out of the game against united
3070928 it will be difficult at chelsea but it will be difficult for them too
3070929 i think if their manager watched the game today which i am sure he did then he will be thinking they will have a difficult game
3070930 it is up to the manager but we just need to focus on our club and get off to a good start
3070931 when the england squad gets selected then i am sure we will be ready
3070932 it wasnt a difficult choice to make coming here everyone in the papers was saying i was going to sunderland or aston villa but i only ever wanted to come here
3070933 as soon as i knew they were interested i said i want to come to pompey
3070934 i came here because the manager has wanted me for two years i met him two years ago when i was at auxerre and i like the man because he gives you confidence
3070935 its a good opportunity for me because the club has a lot of ambition
3070936 i think pompey are a top five premier league side and i believe i can achieve what i want to achieve at this club
3070937 weve got the uefa cup as well and i want to go a long way in that
3070938 it does mean that there is a lot of competition for places but thats good it keeps everyone focussed
3070939 also i can play in midfield or at the back i dont mind really
3070940 the important thing is that im here and ready to play i really want to do a good job here
3070941 hes a player the manager set his sights on very early

3070951 first impression it is much bigger than the sb 800 didnt really seem any heavier but definitely takes up more space this is a consideration for a couple of reasons one cubic inches matter when on the road not so much on a single flash basis but if you are packing half a dozen sb 900s you could probably cram seven in the same space
3070952 in this tutorial we will apply the same effect as dodging and burning but with more control and options and in my opinion better effects on the highlights
3070953 if you have ever shopped for a flash or read a review you may have noticed a section of the spec called the guide number or gn while this value is a measurement of power that the flash has and allows you to compare flash models is this number useful to you at all

3071025 when you discuss security issues if you are telling the truth that should be something protected at the core of the first amendment

3071029 it does not appear to contemplate somebody who is giving a talk to humans nevertheless the court believed that the act of giving a presentation to a group of humans was covered by the computer fraud computer intrusion statute we believe this is wrong

3071047 he had felt ill so he sent the beer away for analysis to a local hospital he was awaiting the results
3071048 but it was an open secret in the area that ian was going to be murdered but she had a secret police lover
3071049 when i recently went home to birmingham a policeman told me perhaps your friend will not be alive when you come back
3071050 so when i went to his house on sunday and saw his car was there and the house locked up i knew then his time had come his wife came out shouting at me and my wife to go away we decided to call the police
3071051 ian was a nice and charming man always helping others
3071052 but secretly he was broke and he had nowhere to go once his home had been taken away from him
3071053 he told us all he was going to be murdered and quite frankly we believed him and thought so too
3071054 friends had brought him a stun gun a tazer to use to protect himself we wanted him to go home to england but he was spending his last pennies trying to get his property back he was due in court today

3071076 just as importantly my dad was deeply interested and devoted to mentoring succeeding generations in the real estate industry his commitment is reflected in the fact that the senior executive team at the alter group has been intact for more than 25 years he always found time for anyone who wanted to learn whether a colleague a reporter or a recent college graduate

3071107 while the us economy has avoided recession to date the major economies are experiencing a generalized slowdown weaker demand in the major economies coupled with the need to contain inflationary pressures will dampen growth in the fast growing asia economies
3071108 at no time in the past 50 years has this happened without the economy being in an official recession
3071109 the path to financial ruin is littered with calls of a bottom and i dont think you want to confuse intermediate bottoms with fundamental bottoms i think that is quite a dangerous game to play

3071120 should coordinate with our partners in germany france and britain to seek an emergency meeting of the g 7 foreign ministers to discuss the current crisis

3071130 he was an equal cornerstone to the evolution of hip hop whats come to be known as r amp b and urban music in general
3071131 so theres absolutely no doubt that isaac hayes will be truly missed and he was a very influential part of music as we hear it today
3071132 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
3071133 after laying the groundwork for the memphis soul sound through his work with stax records his groundbreaking theme song and score for the movie shaft cemented his status as a musical icon
3071134 the world has lost a true creative genius and a passionate humanitarian but his indelible legacy will remain ever present

3071164 she is guilty as sin of murdering that little boy
3071165 the little guy was dealt a bad deck of cards
3071166 he was always trying to bang his head to get relief if he wasnt being supervised he would get those bruises

3071168 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe

3071175 we have a very good team its important to focus on ourselves we can qualify for the world cup we will be in south africa im sure
3071176 the level at the euros was good we have that same level or better
3071177 i must transmit the spirit of those teams to the players to play with confidence in our four games so far step by step we have been getting better

3071181 whether travelers are looking to purchase a last minute gift or are in need of replacement for a lost forgotten or broken product these kiosks will allow them to purchase the product they want from a brand they trust
3071182 the fact is that the united states participates in global markets for both crude and refined products and there are any number of variables that impact supply and prices in those markets
3071183 forbidding exports of u s petroleum reduces the incentive for domestic suppliers to produce and could potentially lead to higher prices if u s production or refining declined
3071184 the benefits of the game struck me during my uni university days i had so many subjects to take and assignments to finish when suddenly i realised that life is just like a large chessboard compartmentalising the problems and decision making abilities life is a like a game of chess
3071185 it helps me locate the problem and identify whats important now and where the battlefield is
3071186 resources are always limited and the window of opportunity is very short we have to be precise and efficient like in chess every move you make is timed you must know whats something that you must have and what is it nice to have

3071207 throw iraq where iran has huge regional imperialist interests back into the worst chaos
3071208 a world where the workers of israel iran iraq were united in opposition to all their rulers and strong enough to get rid of them
3071209 we as socialists want ahmedinejad to be sent to hell not by the israeli and american armies and airforces but by the iranian working class and the oppressed nations in the iranian state but if the israeli airforce attempts to stop iran developing the capacity to wipe it out with a nuclear bomb in the name of what alternative would we condemn israel

3071232 soaring price of oil will leave the iraqi government with a cumulative budget u s taxpayers have spent 42 billion for the stabilization and reconstruction of iraq in contrast the iraqi government has allocated 28 billion for similar improvements but has spent less than 4 billion
3071233 if we would have had our way we would have had a reasonable timetable for the redeployment of most of our troops which would have put pressure on the iraqi government to do what they are not doing
3071234 which is essential to end the conflict in iraq and that is to work out a political settlement among themselves
3071235 what this benchmark study tells the industry is that there is a need for more sophisticated yield management on the part of premium publishers for stronger partnerships between publishers and ad networks for development of best practices and more focus on the value of interactive advertising
3071236 our industry is at an important juncture and now is the time for publishers to adopt strategic approaches to the use of ad networks who themselves have become critical players in the digital ecosystem

3071249 one of the first questions that customers often ask is
3071250 kibaki and odinga maybe sharing power but it is now time they come down to the camp and share in our pain
3071251 last year we had a bad time at brno i could only finish seventh and it was quite disheartening this year however were going there in a very different frame of mind leading the championship following a great win and with our bike and tyres working very well ive had a good summer break just relaxing with my friends and family but now i am really looking forward to going racing again i know that brno is going to be hard and that casey will be a formidable competitor once again and were going to have to work at the maximum from the first practice in order not to lose any time in finding out the right set up for our bike we have seven races left and i am dreaming of them all being as fun as laguna seca
3071252 i am going to brno with a high hopes and above all trying not to think about the disappointment of laguna seca its behind me now in the usa i was fast once again and i hope that i can carry on like this in the czech republic i know that i can brno is a circuit that i like a lot its one of my favourites ive won there three times in 125cc and 250cc its a good place for my riding style and the weather is normally perfect physically i feel very good after the crash and the injuries i definitely feel as good as could be expected its the first time this season that ive really had proper time to recover thanks to the holidays so i think i am in good shape at the moment i am still using my crutches to walk but i have been able to do some training and i know that i wont have a problem when i arrive in brno on thursday
3071253 brno will be the start of a very important run of seven rounds to the end of the season with 25 points on stoner and 41 on pedrosa we are in a good position but we have to manage this advantage in the remaining races it will be an exciting end to the season with pedrosa back in the fight and lorenzo i am sure able to re join the podium club last year at most of these final circuits we werent able to fight at the top but we are working hard now to be able to provide valentino with the most competitive package to allow him to race at the front as he has for the majority of this years races every race from now on will be very important and brno could be one of the most difficult for us against our competitors we have to use all of our potential and work at 100 in all of the practices everybody in yamaha is extremely motivated and we cant wait to be back in the battle especially after the exciting laguna seca show

3071256 brno is a track that has been quite favourable for bridgestone in recent years and we have celebrated victory there for the previous two seasons with the ducati team first with loris capirossi in 2006 and again last year with casey stoner we have two very formidable riders at the top of the table with valentino and casey but there are still 175 points available over the next seven races so the championship is far from over this weekends race has the added complications of a new track surface but i am sure we will see a competitive battle at the front especially with our rivals more determined than ever to renew their championship challenge
3071257 brno has been resurfaced since last years event so we have had to revise our approach to the weekend even if we have been competitive in recent seasons we have had to produce different tyre compounds for this years event compared to the usual brno spec in order to adapt to the new surface in accordance with the sporting regulations and thanks to irta tyre manufacturers were permitted to test at the circuit for two days back in june and this allowed us the chance to acquire data from this new asphalt which appears less grippy than before the track itself is renowned for its elevation changes which put a real focus on bike set up and rider confidence so all elements of the bike rider tyre package will be put to the test this weekend
3071258 im a bit shell shocked to be honest three on the bounce is something special
3071259 i had a good dice with michael rutter early on getting ahead but he came back aggressively then i took him again i got my head down and thought to myself lets see what you can do now it went smoothly although there were a couple of nervous moments going through back markers when i dropped a bit of time
3071260 its good to take the win at last ive been confident all weekend and was so disappointed by the problems we had in the first race

3071504 airlines everywhere are struggling with the current price of oil but the solution to their problems should not lie in an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to less competition and higher fares
3071505 ba aa would have a combination of high frequencies and a transatlantic network that could not be replicated by any other airline alliance and which would make it impossible for other carriers to compete for time sensitive corporate or business travellers
3071506 i think peoples expectations got too high because they began to believe that these prices couldnt drop and almost the beginning of bubble mentality had taken place over the last year or so
3071507 no one knows how far prices will drop but the fact the world economy is slowing is finally getting recognized in the marketplace
3071508 however housing activity is definitely on a downward trend consistent with indications of deteriorating affordability through last year this factor is expected to keep new residential construction activity under pressure going forward our forecast assumes that starts will drop on average 5 3 per cent this year and 14 8 per cent next year
3071509 the final was very hard to win and i never expected to finish ahead of such good surfers i was lucky to get a bomb and make this big air i am very happy to win the wildcard to compete in the asp wqs 6 star sooruz lacanau pro next week
3071510 i am looking forward to take part in the oakley global challenge
3071511 until then i will do my best without pressure and try to keep surfing well and have fun in europe so stoked to get this win
3071512 i am very happy because i aimed at qualifying for bali and it is done
3071513 this competition was very tough the surfing conditions changed a lot and i tried to adapt every day so i am stoked to get back home with this runner up finish
3071514 last year i missed my asp world junior championships wjc ticket so i will do my best to stay in the top 5 to win it and make sure i make it to narabeen
3071515 i had some bombs in the heat but i did not make the best out of it and i could not catch up with any of them
3071516 i dont think youd want to call an end to this u s dollar rise just yet but i wouldnt be surprised to see maybe a little bit of a pullback as we await some more data later in the week
3071517 i dont think theres any major surprises with the data being on the weak side
3071518 i think the slowdown in housing was probably expected and a bit overdue so were not really taking a huge cue off that this morning because the sting was already felt on fridays employment numbers
3071519 i think theres just a bit of fatigue in the canadian bond market
3071520 weve priced in two cuts by the bank of canada so if anything canada may look a little stretched here on a valuation basis
3071521 well i actually did pitch a batman film when warner bros
3071522 in my version there was actually a new villain it wasnt one of the classics which is probably why they didnt use it
3071523 it was more of a hannibal lector type he was somebody already in arkham asylum that bruce went and sort of studied with it was a whole thing i get very emotional about it i still love the story maybe ill get to do it as a comic one day ed note hint hint dc comics
3071524 i just love the respect nolan has for the character and the world
3071525 i thought christopher nolans done an amazing job of bringing out the comic book and i see a lot of movies coughs
3071526 i worked in larger galleries to answer more creative questions and that experience gave me a better sense of the art world
3071527 i needed to do something more personal that inspired me
3071528 i needed a medium to get a better sense of the city and to get a better sense of la
3071529 my range of connections was close to none from the moment i decided to open the space to when i actually opened it meeting artists and people i was interested in working with building up a vision
3071530 the way i see the world around me and how i see this piece of art i need to have more people seeing this and talking about this
3071531 when i was visiting houses i wasnt thinking of them as one or two bedrooms i was looking at them as spaces
3071532 i had my space a place i was in love with
3071533 you really get a sense of that person where they come from just by looking at their work people can try to say art from germany looks the same but this is kind of breaking the stereotypes
3071534 the parties involved are a bit difficult i guess its for the best if it wasnt the best place for me but im definitely looking to move into a new space
3071535 should rep minnis seek legal action for defamation house republicans will stand firmly behind her
3071536 oregonians deserve better from their elected leaders i am deeply disappointed that such a dangerous accusation would come from a state representative especially one elected to lead his party
3071537 there are 643 000 oregonians relying on social security right now and under mccains privatization policy 105 000 of them would be cast into poverty

3071541 i thought this sort of headline was limited to iraq but it turns out that the iranians are also suffering electrical shortages you may well ask how a country drowning in oil revenues can have made such a mess of such things but it turns out that the mullahs have an extraordinary ability to make messes

3071544 kau sudah amat sangat sholeh kau sudah ibadah sekian lama dan untuk itu kau sudah dapat ampunan allah karena itu kau tidak perlu lagi sholat dlsb

3071546 i was elected by a strong majority of 63 percent
3071547 ive received the endorsements of the county firefighters sheriff david gee the police union public defender julie holt the labor unions all the groups im aware of have endorsed me and also the vast majority of the county bar presidents twenty past bar presidents have endorsed me
3071548 i believe i have the superior skills in terms of time management effective use of court time control of the court setting and decisiveness when it comes to ruling
3071549 those are skills that ive developed over the past 13 years as a sole practitioner running not only the business end of my practice but every aspect of the clients case because i do not have associates or paralegals
3071550 i have the judicial experience the education and career background to serve in this position and the wisdom to do the job based on that experience
3071551 i would judge each case on a case by case basis treating everyone fairly and i would always abide by what the law is
3071552 the only judicial candidate in all these races thats board certified
3071553 ive also been part of the management of the public defenders office for many years and dealt with other agencies in the justice system who solve problems that we experience in the court system
3071554 i do believe in the system and i certainly believe in the administration of justice
3071555 i believe my experience makes me qualified i feel like i can make a significant difference in the system
3071556 triple the experience in the courtroom and i have the leadership skills to handle not only dockets but the variety of cases and issues that would be presented in a big courtroom setting as a result of my prior litigation experience and my leadership
3071557 i think that in a nutshell i have a broad base of support not only from the legal community but the support of sheriff gee as well as several of the city and county firefighters and the union that i think is indicative of their confidence in my ability to serve objectively and fairly
3071558 i think that i am exceptionally qualified for the bench i think between the two of us i bring a good perspective and a good balance between my life experience and my legal experience that will allow me to be immediately effective in a number of areas
3071559 people are losing their pay losing their jobs or being penalized in some other way because they had to stay home sick or to take care of a sick child
3071560 i have spent many years earlier on where i went to work sick because i couldnt afford not to work
3071561 it was really miserable for everyone involved my co workers my customers and myself
3071562 i would like to get paid sick days so i can stay home without the fear of being fired
3071563 would cause employers to make tough decisions that would hurt california workers and cost jobs
3071564 the ever increasing burden of costly mandates on employers can cumulatively lower wages reduce health insurance limit training and produce job loss
3071565 for one thing the public health benefits are tremendous because co workers of the sick employees are less likely to catch infectious diseases
3071566 and studies also show that you also improve employee morale and reduce turnover by offering those kinds of benefits
3071567 there is an offer made to the individual and were just finalizing negotiations with them
3071568 we have some applicants for that that look very good
3071569 if they dont meet certain criteria or if they fall below certain job creation levels then that amount is reduced
3071570 i didnt plan on going back to work in any way but was called and offered a position
3071571 ive worked many years and i think my experience and guidance has helped the districts ive gone to
3071572 pensions and salaries are not both compensation for the same job theyre compensation for two different jobs
3071573 to find good interims you need someone who doesnt need a steady income retirees are perfect
3071574 the interim comes in does the difficult things no one wants to be blamed for and then steps aside
3071575 this is a very good deal and its really aimed at making it worth your while to retire as early as you can
3071576 when people retire that early theyre not ready to stop working
3071577 its completely understandable that if they actually have talent that is in short supply theyd seek to come back keep working and get a payment on both sides
3071578 the pension system is the problem when you have a pension system that encourages people to retire in their mid 50s you cant complain about double dipping

3071581 maggiemoos and marble slab offer summit entertainment a unique opportunity to reach our films core audience in an environment that they love and frequent often
3071582 we are hopeful that families will go to the film and then continue their experience by visiting one of maggiemoos and marble slabs many locations
3071583 we were excited to partner with summit entertainment and fly me to the moon
3071584 these brands are about quality products and entertainment so it seemed only natural to align our ice cream with this summers most exciting family film
3071585 have been identified as having disabilities that make them eligible for services and protections under the federal individuals with disabilities education act
3071586 i believe that if you have a major felony conviction whether its cocaine trafficking or mortgage fraud you should not be in a position of trust such as a mortgage broker would have with access to personal financial data and with opportunity to steal from people
3071587 it seems me that there should be a period of time after which you come out of prison that youre not given the right to have a license in professions that have that type of quality
3071588 what this investigation did to us good guys the white hat wearing brokers is that it devalued our license
3071589 there needs to be an iron wall between the consumer and a felon in dealing with mortgages
3071590 the debt for a persons wrongs can be paid in full people can be forgiven by their creator
3071591 he arranged nearly 3 million in fraudulent loans and fleeced 30 people many of them elderly and disabled
3071592 the key to this is proper hiring techniques and doing proper background investigations
3071593 to me the focus should be on the people in charge
3071594 in this case the focus does need to be on people who have been convicted of financial related crimes
3071595 just like you dont want to give firearms authority back to someone who has committed armed robbery
3071596 then we need to give people that second chance otherwise we might be forcing them back into a life of crime and thats not what we want to do we believe in rehabilitation
3071597 if that means we purge all white collar criminals from our ranks great if it means removing all criminals thats probably better but what we have to have is swift action we have to reinstate trust in the profession
3071598 i would generally support the attorney general on this for consumer protection
3071599 but there may be unintended consequences its a bit of a broad brush there are many felonies that had nothing to do with fraud that give you no reason to think theyd be involved in mortgage fraud
3071600 you might be preventing someone from rehabilitating themselves and getting their lives back on track
3071601 he saw this as an opening since its a hot political topic
3071602 its an emotional appeal not a logical one we know that nationwide the majority of people that created the foreclosure crisis are not people previously convicted of a crime this is simply a drop in the bucket of the larger problem of foreclosures
3071603 but i certainly would not have raised this but for the fact that it has direct bearing on the issue at hand im interested in the safety and security of the people of florida thats what they elected me to do i would be very remiss if i didnt do this
3071604 this settlement is what happens when we have a board that rubber stamps everything weve had several people tell us that we should always vote yes when something comes in front of us

3071606 the el mirage police department is grateful that a concerned citizen took the time to call us when she thought the subjects actions were suspicious
3071607 we really need our residents to act as our extra eyes and ears in their neighborhoods they know best when something just doesnt look right
3071608 in addition a lot of good police work and a combined effort by our patrol officers and detectives resulted in the arrest of this career criminal
3071609 the chinese team were very speedy in the first 15 minutes

3071611 i think pompey are a top five premier league side and i believe i can achieve what i want to achieve at this club
3071612 everyone in the papers was saying i was going to sunderland or aston villa but i only ever wanted to come here
3071613 as soon as i knew they were interested i said i want to come to pompey
3071614 i came here because the manager has wanted me for two years i met him when i was at auxerre and i like the man because he gives you confidence

3071617 the body was actually in a spillway which goes from an upper part of the pond to a lower part of a pond there is actually two ponds down there
3071618 at this time the matter is under investigation although it appears to be accidental in nature the state police assigned to the essex county district attorneys office is thoroughly investigating this to make a determination
3071619 this is a good treatment for everyone who likes to have nice feet

3071670 the inability for families to feed their children on food stamps

3071672 people in our community who have struggled to feed their families using food stamps are finding that the challenge has now become virtually impossible whats more families who were able to survive without food stamps are simply no longer able to do so
3071673 government needs to do more to provide real relief to real families
3071674 as the number of people who are struggling to feed their families continues to grow at an alarming rate the government needs to lend a helping hand and prevent this issue from becoming a widespread crisis

3071708 why did the government have to give land to shrine board hasnt the yatra been going on without such a move they wanted to start something and they used this
3071709 the previous governors administration made certain aggressive comments about the land and land is a very very sensitive issue in kashmir there is a basic insecurity when it comes to land under article 370 no outsiders or non kashmiris can buy land so for the local anything to do with control of land is very important the diversion of land to the shrine board unfortunately led to a perception that soon the hindutva forces will thrust their ideology on the valley and then gain control of the region
3071710 people have been witness to the yatra for several years sadhus and people from all over the country would come and worship and go back but about five six years ago the atmosphere became politicised the state started interfering people also saw the hindutva forces gradually become increasingly unsympathetic towards the common kashmiri local this created an atmosphere of mistrust in the minds of the locals
3071711 the yatra was going on peacefully why did they bring in the land issue if as you are saying it is only for temporary structures hasnt the administration been providing facilities wouldnt it continue to do so just where did the issue of title to the land come in
3071712 even during the time when militancy was at its peak we did not have any problem in taking our produce to the rest of india we didnt even have fertilisers then we were under constant threats but this route was never disrupted but today when i see the highway blocked my blood boils how could those people do this
3071713 leaving aside politics the hardliners here and the right wing parties in jammu there was always cordial people to people relations between the two people the dogra people always held the kashmiri people closer to their hearts and the kashmiri pandits are always held in high esteem by the people of kashmir

3071726 rai says this amounts to the illegal use of chemical arms though the bombs are considered incendiary devices
3071727 any chemical that is used against humans or animals that causes harm is considered chemical weapons prohibited behavior
3071728 the rai report may have at its heart an important truth but it is factually inaccurate and misleading
3071729 it was used as an incendiary weapon against enemy combatants

3071734 weve proved it over and over again when the price of crude and refined product falls our customers are the first to see the price at the pumps fall as well with no catches

3071738 if you can walk by a restaurant and see which credit cards it takes and whether zagat recommends them then you should also be able to see how the local health authority rates them

3071751 if saakashvili stood in front of me i would wish him eternal hell after what we have been through
3071752 why is he trying to kill ossetians he should see with his own eyes what he has done with us he would be ripped to bits on the streets if he ever came here
3071753 putin is our golden leader he defends us and gives us food
3071754 one should understand that if we are cut off from russia we will have no future
3071755 if russia withdraws its troops from here we wont be able to do anything look the georgians laid waste to tskhinvali in just one day we will not survive without russia
3071756 the flights are ongoing to redeploy the elements of the georgian contingent so that they can deal with the security issues in their country
3071757 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way

3071763 if third level education has a problem with being underfunded then we need to tackle that issue theres no denying that the standard of our third level education has to remain competitive internationally
3071764 to simply reintroduce flat fees without any more thought or creativity or innovation is a retrograde step we wouldnt support it at any point
3071765 we are against the reintroduction of fees but we would have to look at it if it was officially put to us
3071766 at no time would my philosophy be to ask people to pay who couldnt afford to pay
3071767 my philosophy going forward would be that we would entice far more people in to the third level sector
3071768 in a struggling economy we need to ensure as many people as possible can access third level and not have their nose pressed up against the window
3071769 not only would fees hurt students and their families but they would put at risk the very idea of our knowledge economy by placing a barrier in front of those wishing to further their education

3071796 we found that the vast majority of parents were taking their children to a retail clinic as a substitute for regular care either at a doctors office emergency department or urgent care clinic
3071797 about half of the parents said they wanted to take care of their childrens problems more quickly which suggests to us that doctors offices may not be meeting expectations of parents in terms of providing timely care
3071798 the american academy of pediatrics is concerned that retail clinics interrupt the care that kids otherwise would receive from their regular doctors when those interruptions occur in care information about childrens health problems which their doctors need to know about can slip through the cracks and that can lead to worse health care for kids in the long run
3071799 there are only two camps here the camp supporting terrorism and that is against terrorism there is no intermediate camp that blesses war heroes in secret

3071806 in fashion the well to do are making sure they need what they buy and reducing the number of items they buy without shifting away from the brands they prefer
3071807 executives at procter amp gamble pg the worlds largest consumer company argue that austerity minded us supermarket customers will still opt for proven brands of items such as toilet paper and nappies against cheaper alternatives

3071822 a moral pornographer might use pornography as a critique of current relations between the sexes his business would be the total demystification of the flesh and the subsequent revelation through the infinite modulations of the sexual act of the real relations of man and his kind
3071823 such a pornographer would not be the enemy of women perhaps because he might begin to penetrate to the heart of the contempt for women that distorts our culture even as he entered the realms of true obscenity as he describes it
3071824 for many the line between reality and fantasy blurs they live on the raw edge of repressed urges the bare walls of prison cells serve as a screen on which to project their secret yearnings and worst nightmares

3071846 the territorial integrity of georgia is currently being violated on an enormous scale
3071847 there are bombardments civilians are dying foreign military forces are on georgian territory
3071848 attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged europe into war in the past and we have reason to remember how hitler used this very doctrine little more than half a century ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of
3071849 we did not accept military intervention by milosevics serbia in other yugoslav states on the grounds of protecting serbian passport holders
3071850 the eu and nato must take the initiative and stand up against the spread of imperialist and revisionist policy in the east of europe
3071851 the russian federation has overstepped a red line in keeping the peace and stability in the conflict zone and in protecting russian citizens outside its own borders
3071852 a worsening of the crisis could affect the whole region with its negative consequences
3071853 in this sense it is also a question of a violation of international law as soon as you start to go down the road of military action

3071862 hukuman apa pun layak diberikan pada orang yang bersalah sesuai dengan kadar kesalahannya
3071863 saya kira belumlah saatnya kali ini untuk membahas dan memutuskan sebuah bentuk hukuman sebelum ada kejelasan serta pembuktian

3071871 even though it decision makers clearly recognize the importance of green it solutions such as virtualization and server consolidation there are always going to be growing pains involved with making a significant change to an organization

3071877 clients benefit from the reduced operating costs of a green building while at the same time the planet benefits from the reduced environmental impact
3071878 tending to the needs of the environment is as important as tending to the needs of the person when it comes to home design
3071879 strives to seek the right balance between environmental concerns and aesthetic integrity
3071880 we also need to correct the misimpression that green building is much more expensive than conventional building it is not
3071881 conventional wisdom holds that building green adds 17 to construction costs but the true average is much closer to 5 and when you look at the savings attributable to the reduced usage of energy and water and the reduced impact on the environment there really is no question that building green is the right choice
3071882 lacks the refinement of materials and the interplay of space to be considered great architecture
3071883 the client had gone through two designers when we met and after discussing what she wanted i got to work

3071933 we see this increased stake in enrc to be broadly positive and earnings accretive but more importantly it provides kazakhmys with the necessary blocking stake at egms at present we do not see kazakhmys making an outright bid or further increasing its stake in enrc but it will be happy to have the power to have some influence on enrcs decision making
3071934 dsgs historical acquisition of unieuro in italy has been particularly value destructive and is viewed as a poison pill for a trade consolidator like us group best buy this speculation is likely to be well received
3071935 a clean disposal of the two businesses would obviously make sense loss elimination
3071936 that said getting out cleanly will not be easy and we believe that the shares strong recent run discounts the benefits of a streamlining of the business
3071937 it is hard to see how these disposals would add a great deal of value
3071938 pulling out of italy would be a much more significant move and we would be all for it but if anybody thinks that dsg could get a good price for unieuro in line with kingfishers recent lucrative disposal of their italian operation then they should think again
3071939 and no we still dont think that best buy will bid for dsg we think the shares are well ahead of the game at this level particularly relative to kesa and we are happy to

3071942 sinn fein is opposed to the reintroduction of third level fees education is a right not a privilege and it is the responsibility of the state to ensure its provision
3071943 despite being one of the wealthiest states in europe our educational expenditure is one of the lowest it is below oecd average as a percentage of gdp sinn f in has argued for investment in education should be based on a percentage of 6 per cent of gdp
3071944 the abolition of fees in the mid 1990s was a progressive move but has been fundamentally undermined by successive fianna f il led governments who have failed to invest the economic boom into the countries future
3071945 with third level registration fees set at 825 and a lack of student supports such as childcare and accommodation supplements students and their families already shoulder a considerable financial burden mature students have in most instances to pay full fees when they seek to up or re skill

3071947 tetaplah tinggal di rumah ayahmu lebih baik makan separoh potong roti di rumah daripada mencari sepotong utuh di negara negara yang jauh
3071948 jika pikiranmu sudah bulat kukira kau harus menentukan jalanmu sendiri tapi dengarkan baik baik dan ingat lima nasehat perpisahan yang akan aku berikan kepadamu jika kau selalu menjaganya maka kau tidak akan gagal yang pertama selalu patuhilah tanpa pertanyaan segala perintah orang yang menjadi majikanmu kedua jangan sekali kali bicara kasar atau menyakitkan kepada siapapun ketiga jangan sekali kali kau berbohong keempat jangan sekali kali mencoba untuk tampil menyamai orang orang yang kedudukannya di atasmu dan yang kelima ke mana saja kau pergi jika kau bertemu orang orang yang membaca atau mengajarkan kitab kitab suci berdiamlah dan dengarkan barang beberapa menit saja niscaya kau akan memperoleh kekuatan dalam mengerjakan pekerjaan
3071949 kemarin ketua wazir raja kami kehilangan seorang pelayannya dan sedang mencari penggantinya sekarang kaulah satu satunya orang yang ia butuhkan karena kau masih muda tinggi dan tampan aku sarankan kau melamarnya ke sana
3071950 sesungguhnya tuan wazir ada sumur kira satu atau dua mil dari sini yang telah dibuat raja yang dulu beratus ratus tahun yang lalu orang orang mengatakan bahwa sumur itu besar sekali dan tak pernah kering yang ditutupi oleh bangunan batu yang berat dengan deretan undag undag
3071951 bahwa tak ada seorangpun yang dapat dipercaya sampai ia diuji pergilah dan carilah air untuk rajah dan orang orangnya dari sumur itu
3071952 selalu patuhilah perintah orang yang kau layani tanpa banyak tanya
3071953 sesungguhnya tuan aku yakin di manapun anda tak bisa menemukan orang lain secantik isteri tuan
3071954 paling tidak kau bisa lihat aku tidak tahu sudah berapa orang yang kubunuh karena menghina isteriku dengan mengatakan bahwa ia hanyalah tulang belulang yang sudah mati kau seorang pemuda yang baik dan aku akan membantumu
3071955 kau telah membuatku senang dan kau boleh meminta bantuanku apapun yang kau inginkan akan kulakukan untukmu mungkin kau ingin aku tunjukkan di mana terkubur harta karun raja raja yang telah meninggal
3071956 adalah bahwa kau segera berhenti menghantui sumur ini sehingga orang orang bebas keluar masuk untuk mengambil air
3071957 aku tak ingin siapapun tahu hukuman ini dilakukan atas keinginanku dan siapapun yang menyebut persoalan ini akan dihukum berat

3071967 no hay accesos en condiciones ni cortafuegos en la masa forestal y al no haber pastoreo tenemos problemas con las hierbas secas

3071996 the next generation network which will make extensive use of ip and web services is still years away from generating serious revenue and in the meantime carriers are not about to fork lift out the infrastructure that makes them money today
3071997 gateways form the link between todays revenue generating services and what the carriers will be building to generate their future revenue streams so we expect the telecommunications gateway market to continue growing for at least the next five years

3072013 this decision clears the path toward our pursuit of an effective and fair public defense system that protects new yorkers constitutional rights
3072014 the states broken public defense system can and must be fixed unfortunately the legislature has failed to address this crisis forcing us to take action in the courts
3072015 the public defense crisis in new york is unfair both to defendants and to the lawyers who are charged with representing them
3072016 defendants are denied justice because they cannot afford to pay private lawyers and public defense attorneys are not given the resources tools and training they need to do right by their clients

3072024 our study is the first to specifically examine psa screening in younger men which provides an important assessment of quality of care especially for high risk groups
3072025 further investigation will be required to understand the impact of new risk stratification strategies with particular focus on the policy implications of potentially large increases in health care resource use
3072026 we showed that the patients who got the real drug rather than placebo were less likely to relapse to drinking or if they relapsed it was later
3072027 in other words gabapentin prevented and delayed relapse meanwhile patients reported sleeping better in both the treatment and placebo groups which may be due to the gabapentin in the first group and the resumption of drinking in the other
3072028 there may be some underlying chemical changes in the brain that prompt alcoholics to report more insomnia as a co existing condition than non alcoholics
3072029 a possible explanation of these new findings is that the gabapentin might decrease the insomnia initially and the patient may not need or crave alcohol as a treatment for the insomnia were also looking into other factors that may have an effect on the neurochemistry of the brain and see how they could impact recovery and sleep
3072030 these results raise more questions for us to explore including the potential impact of gabapentin on people who are in recovery from alcohol dependence but do not report insomnia
3072031 food allergic individuals need to increase the awareness of their food allergy among the people around them
3072032 this would include not only telling them that they are food allergic but also showing them how to treat them and how to recognize signs of an ongoing reaction
3072033 there are serious issues that need to be addressed in terms of educating these young adults that it is of utmost importance to not only maintain emergency medication but to have it with you at all times
3072034 until all students who display symptoms of a severe reaction are receiving epinephrine i would say that theres a significant gap that needs to be closed
3072035 we see an increased ability among clients who regularly exercise to do things that they had not been able to do independently like going up and down a flight of stairs or getting into a car
3072036 getting into a habit of physical activity certainly has long term benefits
3072037 some days are worse than others when it comes to a condition like parkinsons
3072038 so it is really important that someone working out really listens to their body
3072039 i know that exercise has delayed the progression of my parkinsons and i know that i have become stronger that is why i keep coming back
3072040 it keeps your mind working as well as your body many people dont realize just how much better they can feel by exercising until they get into a routine of doing it

3072053 life is not measured by the number of breaths we take but by the moments that take our breath away
3072054 there are thousands of veterans of wars in korea vietnam the persian gulf and the current campaigns in iraq and afghanistan who are isolated behind the walls of v a hospitals and nursing homes across the country we have an obligation to make sure that every veteran has the opportunity to make his or her voice heard at the ballot box
3072055 to assist patients who seek to exercise their right to register and vote however due to hatch act requirements and to avoid disruptions to facility operations voter registration drives are not permitted
3072056 wanted to ensure that our staff remains focused on caring for our veterans instead of having to determine the political agenda of each group that might try to enter our facilities
3072057 it appears to us that the department took one step forward for our veterans and the right to vote by directing that assistance be provided with voter registration and with securing absentee ballots but then took a large step back by prohibiting voter registration drives
3072058 about time you woke up the healer here was starting to get a bit worried about you
3072059 im very pleased to meet you although i must say you gave me quite a scare when you portkeyed into the middle of my consulting room
3072060 just before i passed out it felt like my throat was swelling up i could hardly breathe
3072061 the muggles call it anaphylactic shock basically you suffered a massive allergic reaction to the doxy venom
3072062 allow me to offer my congratulations by the way i believe youve set a new record for the most number of doxy bites that a person has survived
3072063 im afraid young mr weasley isnt going to be doing any dancing anytime soon
3072064 he has third degree burns to almost all of his legs oh i can treat him
3072065 but unfortunately it will take time i cant really walk out of st mungos with half a dozen bottles of skin regeneration potion under my arm
3072066 everything seems to be in order mr potter your wounds are healing nicely but you will need to rest for a few more days to allow your body to recover fully you should also try to drink plenty of fluids ill just finish changing mr weasleys dressings
3072067 and then i really must get back to st mungos
3072068 oh i was so afraid i was going to lose you both
3072069 whats going on why are we here how long have i been out of it
3072070 once the healer had got you both stable he bought you here because if you stayed at st mungos there was too much chance of the news becoming public
3072071 ive barely let it out of my sight since we got back
3072072 we should take it over to godrics hollow as soon as possible
3072073 how long will it be before rons better the healer said something about not being able to get the potions he needed
3072074 i dont know i spoke to the healer earlier and he said the treatment isnt difficult it just takes time whats really slowing things down at the moment is all the potions hes having to give ron for the pain thats why hes asleep at the moment
3072075 ron and i have ended up hospitalized just trying to retrieve the cup how are we going to survive this two more times at this rate ill be amazed if i survive to even face voldemort
3072076 of course thats assuming i survive mrs weasley has she said anything to you
3072077 i havent seen mr or mrs weasley since we got here all ive been able to find out is that theyve gone away somewhere but no one will tell me where or why
3072078 are you sure theyre not just away on order business
3072079 remember that officially we still arent members because were still kids moody or kingsley or whoevers in charge probably doesnt want us worrying about it
3072080 but fred and george were here yesterday and every time i asked them about mr and mrs weasley they changed the subject
3072081 what could be so important that they would do that
3072082 i dont know harry the real question is how can we find out
3072083 dads always warned us about making unbreakable vows are you sure they werent joking hermione
3072084 i think i know fred and george well enough by now
3072085 believe me ive never seen them looking so serious before
3072086 well weve got plenty of time to find out if they were joking or not
3072087 according to the healer its going to be at least another fortnight before youre back on your feet
3072088 and you can stop beating yourself up about that as well
3072089 you would still be wandering in circles around the forest
3072090 or if you had managed to somehow get past that barrier youd have either been ripped to pieces by one of aragogs cousins or bitten to death by doxies from what hermione tells me
3072091 but how many times have you got hurt for me especially you ron im just worried that your lucks going to run out sometime
3072092 while im out of action you two should at least make yourselves useful and concentrate on finding a way to destroy that cup
3072093 no i just did enough to confirm that it is protected magically i think you were right we should take it back to godrics hollow there arent too many order members around at the moment we should be able to leave without anyone seeing us
3072094 now that you mention it i havent seen anyone here except tonks and the healer
3072095 apparently there was a big death eater attack in manchester while we were away
3072096 they practically destroyed their version of diagon alley most of the order is up there trying to track where they came from
3072097 harry oh i knew you were too weak to try apparating
3072098 youre still weak and no one knows if there are any long term effects from multiple doxy bites
3072099 can we just get inside please before we attract attention
3072100 its hard to believe that something so beautiful can hold something so evil
3072101 certainly enough to make destroying it by magic next to impossible
3072102 how were the others destroyed i dont think youve told me
3072103 dumbledore never told me how hed dealt with the ring
3072104 but when i last saw it the stone had a big crack all the way through it
3072105 it sounds like you dont actually have to destroy a horcrux literally you just have to damage it enough so that the soul fragment escapes
3072106 if its protected in the same way as the locket was its going to be pretty impervious to most things
3072107 the basilisk venom was corrosive it burnt a hole straight through it maybe we can do the same here pour something into the cup thatll melt the surface
3072108 well basilisk venom is a bit difficult to come by harry
3072109 a lot of muggle house cleaners are acidic though i could try mixing something together but it might take time ive never done any muggle chemistry
3072110 voldemorts strengths lie in lies and deception yes and there just happens to be a very powerful liquid that can combat both of those
3072111 veritaserum that could be even harder to get hold of than basilisk venom even if i tried making it myself it takes over a month
3072112 he is wondering why harry potter is pointing his wand at him though
3072113 a house elf must always be able to find his master harry potter sir
3072114 dobby is a free elf and can serve whoever he wishes
3072115 mr wheezy wishes to see harry potter urgently he has asked dobby to take harry potter to see him
3072116 harry potter does not know the place where mr wheezy is at the moment
3072117 id better go and see what he wants have you got a quill and a bit of paper hermione
3072118 ill go and see mr weasley and then meet you back here
3072119 if anyone does manage to break in ive got no way of protecting it
3072120 i assure you i am not a death eater in disguise i have some very important news for you news that could have catastrophic effects if it were to fall into the wrong hands
3072121 what did we have to eat that night dumbledore brought me to the burrow

3072456 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events

3072460 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3072461 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3072462 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3072463 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3072464 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3072465 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3072466 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3072467 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3072591 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
3072592 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
3072593 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
3072594 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
3072595 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
3072596 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
3072597 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
3072598 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
3072599 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
3072600 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
3072601 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
3072602 but well do everything we can to try to keep him fresh we might give him an extra day here or there well try to find a spot to do that
3072603 if youre going to get into the playoffs were probably going to get a little further than that

3072611 with the demise of our credibility and sphere of influence attacks against u s interests abroad and terror operations on american soil are inevitable
3072612 while the united states has shown itself to be a paper tiger adverse to defending its friends and allies the russian bear remains a power without equal willing and able to impose its will upon any and all foes
3072613 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community

3072620 he has problems with certain areas that dont have a certain respect for his pet laws that are immoral and areas that have a certain demographic makeup
3072621 i also say good riddance to those so called friends in my network who removed me and rj can say the same to me
3072622 sorry i dont write the laws but i expect society to obey the same law i am subjected to
3072623 my only issue with new orleans is that the taxpayer spent two hundred billion dollars to rebuild a city that is still located behind insufficient levies and below sea level subject to getting hammered by another hurricane
3072624 dont forget you removed me first that said good luck on digg unless you walk lockstep with the libs youll still be looked down upon
3072625 ive lived long enough to know that those disadvantaged african americans havent chosen their condition and that given any reasonable opportunity they would make improvements something is standing in their way its racism plain and simple

3072627 while i do not approve of marshall law theres nothing wrong with imposing a curfew among aspects of martial law are censorship of radio and newspapers
3072628 it is intolerable this atmosphere we live in with the abusive conduct of federal agents or agencies deeply enmeshed with the machinery of the state generalized wiretapping is an indicator of and an exercise in authoritarian politics
3072629 supreme court justices react to the suspicion of wiretaps in the highest court in the land
3072630 o sinal captado altamente suspeito e vinha de fora do stf
3072631 o que nos leva a suspeitar de um poss vel monitoramento que pode ter ocorrido nas proximidades do edif cio sede
3072632 the signal detected is highly suspect and came from outside the court
3072633 which leads us to suspect possible monitoring which may have occurred near the court premises
3072634 the only reason the courts did not order that man hanged was that there was no hard evidence against him so lets hang him anyway
3072635 the maoists still have the rebel army confined in camps and weapons in containers and the peace process is yet to be taken to a logical conclusion
3072636 maoists cant run the government if they are put in a wheelchair with their hands and feet tied together
3072637 major sequeira has not benefited from any formal training or accreditation in the management of searching for missing persons
3072638 the search officers with the exception of the search and rescue team dispatched from lisbon had not benefited from any formal training in search procedures
3072639 we are thinking of organising elections which we want to be transparent and democratic
3072640 we are used to respecting our commitments so for this reason we cannot take the risk of giving a date which might not be respected
3072641 i cant say now whether i will be a candidate because it depends on the future i wont rule it out but i am not saying i will be a candidate either
3072642 unfortunately we have not been able to escort many families back through the task force we had to absorb a 10 fold increase in evacuees
3072643 we want to show to the people that we are earnest in holding clean elections
3072644 with this automated elections we are confident that this cheating will be vastly reduced the vote padding and shaving will be reduced with the fast and quick voting counting and transmission of results
3072645 chinese have the highest breast cancer rates followed by malays and indians but the pattern of breast cancer according to age is quite different
3072646 for the chinese and malay post menopausal rates essentially plateau off whereas for the indian population the age specific rates continue to increase over the entire age group
3072647 singapore women have adopted more western lifestyles they are having fewer and fewer kids
3072648 they have their first child later in life which means they have an increased risk of breast cancer because there are few factors that protect women from breast cancer the same way as having many children and the first child very early in life
3072649 the important message that we want to get across is that women who are 50 and above especially those who have started their family late and have a small number of children should go for mammographic screening
3072650 more of the women without cancer were eating soy products compared to those with breast cancer weve also found that women who had most protection were women who had been eating soy foods since adolescent days
3072651 i think i am good at both positions but naturally i am more instinctive on defense than i am on offense
3072652 i took over the starting role at tight end the last four games of my freshman season going into my sophomore year i knew i had to be more dependable more consistent we had a great senior class and they taught me how to work and learn i really improved that year we won the state championship and last year we made it to the finals we do not lose around here too much laugh
3072653 i am going to mostly play offense this year they want to develop some depth on defense but i will come in on a lot of situational downs i will just do what ever they need me to do i just want us to reach our potential and gel i want to enjoy my last year because it is going by so fast i just want to enjoy every moment of it
3072654 the only camp i went to was ole miss but i did not do any of the combine stuff i also visited tennessees kentuckys and louisvilles campuses this summer
3072655 they called my coaches last week to let me know that i had a scholarship i actually went down there the day before the camp so i could meet their coaches and tour the campus i went down there last year for the ole miss lsu game but i never really had a chance to look at all of their facilities they have a really nice campus and it seems like a real laid back town coach austin and i have a really good relationship they also have a lot of real good young talent and i think they are going to turn it around next year i was pretty impressed
3072656 ucla said they were sending my offer in the mail this week i have a total of 11 right now they are tennessee vandy ole miss auburn south carolina kentucky oklahoma louisville marshall oregon and ucla
3072657 tennessee was kind of the same way as ole miss i visited with all of the coaches that i really had not gotten to know from before they always have a chance to win the sec or national championship their resume is impressive coach clauson and i have a good relationship they are high on my list as well
3072658 there are some really great people in their program the new defensive schemes that coach english is bringing in is exciting i would not mind playing for him it is going to be a very aggressive defense just the way i like to play i know for sure that i will go back to louisville and ole miss for official visits
3072659 i am pretty much open right now i am starting to narrow my list down i have 11 offers right now and a lot of other schools are close so i want to wait and see how that plays out first then i will narrow it down when i take my act test in september

3072694 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3072695 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

3072700 theres a variety of tactics that employers have been employing over the last three to six years that has had an impact on the market
3072701 pretty much every employer has to do something or is doing something in an effort to bring that number down
3072702 it is encouraging that the growth in health care costs is going down but there is still more work to be done
3072703 when costs go up as great as this theres a lot of market pressure brought to bear on all of the parts of the market to bring those costs down and i think thats whats been happening over the last six years or so

3072788 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced
3072789 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
3072790 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
3072791 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
3072792 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
3072793 speak softly and carry a big stick and you will go far
3072794 he had a strong belief that judges should not be in the public eye
3072795 this is stuff you see other people do and you think thatd be awesome
3072796 i was an extra in the surrogates with bruce willis
3072797 i was in the background in a beauty shop scene
3072798 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3072799 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3072800 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3072801 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3072802 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3072803 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3072804 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3072805 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3072806 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3072807 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3072808 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3072809 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3072810 whats happening is that flooding events are all of a sudden not being labeled 50 year floods anymore
3072811 prior to that i hadnt heard anybody talking about it in the community
3072812 its more something you think that older people should take care of for us
3072813 such a friendly guy he has a very unique way of massaging different and better than any massage ive ever
3072814 we simply must do everything we can in our power to slow down global warming before it is too late the science is clear the global warming debate is over
3072815 americans are coming to understand that global temperatures have actually cooled over the last 10 years and are predicted to continue cooling over the next 10
3072816 if you look from 1995 you dont see any change that could be regarded as statistically significant for the last 13 or 14 years nothing has been happening
3072817 if you take the last 30 years its completely evident that its going up
3072818 this is a challenge for climate modelers we dont fully understand it
3072819 if we knew the answer to things like this one would have more confidence
3072820 the whole notion that something outside has to cause a change is absurd
3072821 weve looked at the sun volcanoes are not doing anything weird the oceans can dump heat into the atmosphere but theyre getting warmer too
3072822 the wall street journal gets a gigantic miss for taking at face value the recent actions of moqtada al sadr rather than a surrender i think his recent actions are the start of hezbollah south with strong support from iran the real nature of transformation will become apparent once the united states troops are withdrawn
3072823 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3072824 ralph nader is not a protest candidate he is not for sale and neither is my vote
3072825 i am not voting for a third party or a third person nor is my vote a protest vote and obama has the support of democrats not necessarily liberals liberals like myself are backing ralph nader
3072826 third or fourth party presidential candidates could garner enough votes in november to make a difference in some of the hotly contested swing states
3072827 i cant vote for anybody who doesnt call for an immediate end to the war in iraq
3072828 the war under post nuremburg laws is a criminal war of aggression its illegal we have no right as a nation to debate the terms of the occupation we have no right to be there
3072829 a few things we wont tolerate personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
3072830 personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
3072831 campaigns and parties often use dirty tricks to suppress the vote
3072832 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3072833 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3072834 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3072835 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3072836 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3072837 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3072838 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
3072839 could ralph naders entrance and exit have helped al gore the impact of decoy dynamics on consumer choice
3072840 we found that the entrance and exit of a third option the nader effect can profoundly impact consumers preference
3072841 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favorite even if they werent before
3072842 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3072843 the increase in affinity that a product may receive when a decoy option real or not is removed can mark a significant change in consumer choice
3072844 in terms of elections even a 5 percent increase in preference makes a huge difference at the ballot box
3072845 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3072846 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3072847 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3072848 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3072849 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3072850 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3072851 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3072852 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3072853 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3072854 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3072855 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3072856 historically presidential nominations were decided at the party conventions and as a result the vice presidential running mates were also selected at the conventions gallups jeff jones notes
3072857 that made it difficult to disentangle the effect of naming a vice presidential running mate on a candidates support from the
3072858 the small window of time after the announcement of a presidential candidates running mate but before the convention has taken place
3072859 similar to the pattern seen with clinton in 1996 support for gore held steady during bushs vice presidential selection phase at 41 percent
3072860 our partnership with nbc for the 2008 beijing olympics is a tremendous opportunity for rodale to offer its authoritative and trusted content in running and cycling to online viewers across the united states and the world
3072861 all eyes will be on beijing in august and we are so pleased that nbc recognizes rodale
3072862 through our coverage of the beijing olympic games it is our goal to provide our audience with a next generation online experience that encapsulates the storytelling and analysis nbc olympics is known for providing rodale
3072863 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3072864 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3072865 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3072866 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3072867 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
3072868 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
3072869 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3072870 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
3072871 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3072872 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3072873 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3072874 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3072875 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3072876 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3072877 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3072878 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3072879 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3072880 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3072881 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3072882 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3072883 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3072884 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3072885 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3072886 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
3072887 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
3072888 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
3072889 president obama and a democratic congress will likely dole out entitlements like free health care child care and cash payments to anyone who falls under a certain income level that means that people who drink gin all day long will be getting some of my hard earned money folks who dropped out of school who are too lazy to hold a job and who smoke reefer 24 7 will all get some goodies in the mail from uncle barack and aunt nancy
3072890 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
3072891 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
3072892 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
3072893 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
3072894 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
3072895 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
3072896 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
3072897 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
3072898 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
3072899 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
3072900 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
3072901 its very hard to tell your banker that hes wrong
3072902 ever wonder what washington has done with your tax dollars this olympics is your chance to find out for the last 8 years the bush administration has been paying china billions of dollars in interest on the trillions it borrowed for tax breaks pork and special privileges you never got that money helped create thousands of businesses and millions of jobs in china so as you enjoy the games keep an eye on your tax dollars at work the way our economys going its tough to pay your bills but take heart you already paid chinas
3072903 youre looking forward now to a much different life for yourself
3072904 there are some one way conversations going on cause ive said i cant talk but i certainly can listen
3072905 the thing thats important for someone with my experience to talk about is the state of politics in washington
3072906 its created what i call a extremely dysfunctional hyperpartisan senate were getting little to nothing done
3072907 could romney be planning to establish residency in california with an eye on the governors seat gov schwarzenegger is forced out by term limits in 2010 stay tuned
3072908 governor romney has been looking at property on the west coast because he has family in california and because his wife ann spends a good deal of time there riding horses
3072909 the number of deviant offenders a community can afford to recognize is likely to remain stable over time
3072910 malta is not an obvious place for a love affair to flourish not unlike staten island it tends to be a conservative place
3072911 word about the affair spread and republican officials soon became concerned fearing it would be exposed sources said
3072912 a pattern of conduct was exhibited among many individuals to remain willfully ignorant
3072913 i lost confidence in her and im not going to kid you
3072914 i was also concerned with this other relationship thing it didnt look like it should
3072915 at least 70 frivolous duplicative and repetitive actions in this court
3072916 by the time the order was issued that number had reached 82
3072917 the government can operate on its own self produced money
3072918 all superdelegates should save their endorsements for candidates with a real shot
3072919 when it comes to national security any big dog should think twice before agreeing to a long journey with mitt romney
3072920 a small varmint gun totin civil rights marching nra endorsed fantasy candidate
3072921 its one thing to campaign for my dad someone whose principles i line up with almost entirely
3072922 in this time of war i simply cannot let my campaign be a part of aiding a surrender to terror
3072923 we cannot allow the next president of the united states to retreat in the face of evil extremism
3072924 as a lifelong hunter i didnt want to miss the start of varmint season
3072925 its tenacious coverage of the twists and turns in the scandal involving the states senator larry craig
3072926 this was news to most idaho voters who have viewed the whole affair with shock outrage embarrassment and dismay but craig didnt stop there
3072927 i know ill love it because clean air clean water and many many many mountains
3072928 my heart my mind my body my soul my thoughts are in this to win
3072929 if i save one babys life it will be worth it
3072930 voters are casting a vote for a person and not a political proposition
3072931 the people that vote for me are more intelligent than to have something defined in legislation like this
3072932 the pirates are not in a rebuilding mode were in a building mode
3072933 trolling for sex in a mens room doesnt logically require that you support gay marriage
3072934 over the course of my public life i have insisted i believe correctly that people regardless of their position or power take responsibility for their conduct i can and will ask no less of myself
3072935 its one thing to campaign for my dad someone whose principles i line up with almost entirely
3072936 youve got this built in campaign team with your sons
3072937 to discuss the former massachusetts governor becoming the face of conservatism
3072938 was it for this that all that blood was shed
3072939 if someone had suggested a year ago and a half ago that we would be welcoming mitt romney as a potential leader of the conservative movement no one would have believed it
3072940 but over the last year and a half he has convinced us he is one of us and walks with us
3072941 you could tell everybody at the table sitting with romney was asking himself is he the one
3072942 i sampled all of the alaskan classics moose salmon and whale oh so good
3072943 theres no more important voter in this media market than the hispanic swing vote
3072944 i think people like me feel proud of being in a thinking process rather than just going with one party
3072945 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3072946 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3072947 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3072948 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3072949 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3072950 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3072951 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3072952 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3072953 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
3072954 thats second nature to me whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
3072955 is different than anything ive ever done that kind of has a pop quality to it
3072956 when i was a kid growing up in the southwest i worked for a rodeo company
3072957 so we wanted to do the comedy to tip our hats to the old burt reynolds movies and we wanted our characters to be strong and have the toast be a thread that runs through the movie
3072958 i was really concerned about hollywood meets ted nugent with their extreme difference in philosophies
3072959 teds a good friend of mine and teds not a hater yeah hes got a strong agenda and he carries a gun but hes never pulled it on anyone he can be dangerous if you try to tread on him but he doesnt bring the hate to the table hes so fun he kept everybody in stitches
3072960 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
3072961 al gore heard me say that and said were going to get some people on opposite ends of confrontation like rosie and donald trump and put em on the tv
3072962 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3072963 you realize that you know what 50 million spins as a writer compares to lennon the bee gees and billy joel
3072964 ive got a 35 greatest hits album in the store right now
3072965 you can imagine how much it meant to people who needed that song whether people hated it or loved it it left its mark
3072966 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3072967 most people who talk about courtesy of the red white and blue never even heard the song
3072968 if you read it word for word you know what it means lets go out and get the people responsible for 9 11 they attacked new york they attacked the pentagon they came and killed a bunch of innocent americans
3072969 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war
3072970 my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3072971 his presidency will be better judged 40 years from now
3072972 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say
3072973 if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
3072974 i think obama stands the best chance for the democratic party since clinton mccain is a good solid choice a smarter version of what we have we probably need a change and the economy needs a change and come election day ill have my mind made up
3072975 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3072976 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3072977 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3072978 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3072979 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3072980 just so you all know we did set a record
3072981 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3072982 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3072983 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3072984 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3072985 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3072986 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3072987 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3072988 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3072989 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3072990 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3072991 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3072992 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3072993 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3072994 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3072995 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3072996 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3072997 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3072998 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3072999 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3073000 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3073001 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3073002 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3073003 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
3073004 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
3073005 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
3073006 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
3073007 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3073008 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3073009 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3073010 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3073011 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3073012 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3073013 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3073014 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3073015 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3073016 you dont have to attack the united states to put us on our back you just cut 30 percent of the oil
3073017 global warming is on page two for me page one is foreign oil
3073018 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
3073019 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
3073020 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
3073021 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3073022 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3073023 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
3073024 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
3073025 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
3073026 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
3073027 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
3073028 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
3073029 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
3073030 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
3073031 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
3073032 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
3073033 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
3073034 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
3073035 dispongo di una meravigliosa dimostrazione di questo teorema che non pu essere contenuta nel margine troppo stretto della pagina
3073036 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3073037 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3073038 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3073039 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3073040 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3073041 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3073042 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3073043 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3073044 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3073045 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3073046 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3073047 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3073048 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3073049 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3073050 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3073051 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
3073052 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3073053 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3073054 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3073055 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3073056 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3073057 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3073058 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3073059 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3073060 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
3073061 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
3073062 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
3073063 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
3073064 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
3073065 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
3073066 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3073067 i didnt bring it into the courts mr gore brought it into the courts
3073068 richard nixon when he lost to john f kennedy thought that the election had been stolen in chicago which was very likely true with the system at the time
3073069 but he did not even think about bringing a court challenge that was his prerogative so if you dont like the courts getting involved talk to mr gore
3073070 bear in mind that the issue wasnt whether or not the election was going to be decided by a court or not it was whether it was going to be decided by the florida court or by the united states supreme court for a federal election
3073071 i mean one side or the other was going to feel that was a politicized decision but that goes with the territory
3073072 i dont think our legal system should be that complex i think that any system that requires that many of the countrys best minds and they are the best minds is too complex
3073073 if you look at the figures where does the top of the class in college go to it goes into law they dont go into teaching now i love the law there is nothing i would rather do but it doesnt produce anything
3073074 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3073075 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
3073076 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
3073077 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
3073078 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3073079 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3073080 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3073081 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3073082 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3073083 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3073084 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3073085 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
3073086 are you better off now than you were four years ago
3073087 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
3073088 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
3073089 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
3073090 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3073091 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3073092 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
3073093 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
3073094 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
3073095 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
3073096 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
3073097 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
3073098 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
3073099 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
3073100 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
3073101 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
3073102 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
3073103 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3073104 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3073105 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3073106 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3073107 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3073108 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3073109 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3073110 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3073111 est n ligando en general a todos los emergentes si te fijas brasil m xico todos est n bajando por la fortaleza que est teniendo el d lar y porque estados unidos est en una zona ascendente de corto plazo
3073112 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3073113 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3073114 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
3073115 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
3073116 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3073117 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
3073118 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
3073119 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
3073120 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
3073121 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
3073122 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
3073123 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
3073124 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
3073125 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
3073126 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
3073127 tila is great and totally fun court is having a good time with her but it definitely isnt anything serious
3073128 egypt is attacking the tunnels on its border with the gaza strip because of the great american and israeli pressure it faces
3073129 even though it decision makers clearly recognize the importance of green it solutions such as virtualization and server consolidation there are always going to be growing pains involved with making a significant change to an organization
3073130 if going green means replacing servers that are already delivering reliable it to an organization then widespread adoption may take some time

3073132 took a whole lot of tryin just to get up that hill
3073133 we are two people who come home at night to a home now
3073134 the car just took off in the corner and into the wall i went
3073135 the car seems real stable and it might even be a little better than the primary our goal now is to head to the front and stay there
3073136 we thought we were having some issues with the power steering or brake fluid but under review we diagnosed the problem was with an oil leak after the race i have to give our engine builder greg iossi credit for building a great motor that stuck together despite the leak im really proud of the sheltra motorsports team we had a tough weekend but the guys never gave up and we bounced back from some adversity to record a 10th place finish well take it
3073137 just because i cant explain it doesnt mean its a ufo
3073138 unidentified flying object i think that pretty much covers it
3073139 this stubborness of yours its why i fell in love with you
3073140 michigan is a totally different track from orp as a team weve run well over the last few weeks and had three good weeks in a row the team is working hard and that will help when we get to michigan we should have good results there too the gains weve made as a team will definitely help
3073141 michigan is one of those tracks where you can run all over the track has multiple grooves from the bottom to the top as long as the car is good we should have a good day hopefully we can go there stay out of trouble and finish better than the last time i was there
3073142 my aarons lucky dog team worked really hard to give us a rocket ship here i was really glad i could put it on the pole for them we had a great race today and the momentum is definitely with us now
3073143 it was just a little too loose at the start of the runs my guys have really stepped up and i appreciate all their hard work week in and week out were looking forward to the dirt races coming up it should be very interesting this is a new experience for all of us and i think well have a lot of fun
3073144 finally getting a top five finish for the no 2 camping world chevrolet feels great
3073145 we had a shot at this one tonight had there been 15 20 more laps in this race we would be sitting in victory lane im just glad to finally get a good finish for this team we roll off the truck fast every week ernie cope crew chief and the guys do a great job i want to thank kevin and delana harvick for giving us the opportunity to build great trucks and believing in this team we are going to get us a win once we get all the pieces to fit together just right
3073146 gostei muito do programa do marc o da tfc ou o aqui em bsb desde priscas
3073147 the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty
3073148 where can the purest principles of morality be learned so clearly or so perfectly as from the bible especially the new testament
3073149 nicodemus you have to be born again because you will not inherit eternal life until you are born of the spirit youve been born of the flesh to be born again of the spirit youve got to receive the life of god in you
3073150 lord i ask you to forgive me of that sin cleanse me with your blood from all unrighteousness
3073151 that is wrong and you need to repent of that
3073152 beloved as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling
3073153 for it is god which is at work in you
3073154 okay it doesnt matter how i live or what i do
3073155 you can get out of here cause theres nothing changing in this situation
3073156 as you therefore have received christ jesus the lord so walk in him
3073157 weve struggled some lately so this couldnt have come at a better time for us
3073158 mike greci and the guys gave me a great car today we really didnt have to make any changes to it all day
3073159 the car was awesome and im really proud of my guys hopefully we can carry this momentum to michigan
3073160 but i dont really have a good argument that the government should be the one to prevent abortion because of my religious beliefs
3073161 yes the other issues do matter but as a christian my belief system supports the idea that human life is sacred it doesnt matter if that human life is accidental or the result of rape as tragic as those situations are human life is sacred
3073162 for many democratic activists and operatives the phrase white christian still conjures up images of finger wagging priests and scopes era fundamentalists
3073163 even if he makes a marginal improvement with that huge group of voters that could ultimately be very important in certain swing states like my state of virginia where evangelicals comprise a large portion of the voters
3073164 many will either sit on their hands on election day or even if they vote for mccain they wont be out there mobilizing the base and doing the hard work that these folks have done in the past for the republican party
3073165 there are some data that young evangelicals are focusing on a variety of issues not just the social issues but i dont see a voting shift taking place just because younger folks care about the environment doesnt mean thats going to trump their concerns about the life issues
3073166 thats the minimal step he has to take to reduce the animosity against him on abortion
3073167 and if he doesnt do even that hes basically kissing goodbye the chances of making deep inroads in the white evangelical vote
3073168 he has got to come out forcibly and talk about reducing abortions in america he has to forcibly come out and talk about education and abstinence programs
3073169 we evangelicals have to face the fact that when we speak on this issue we in the church do not have enough authority to convince people of that position and have to resort to the coercion of the law
3073170 we have lost our moral authority in this society we havent been able to impact our own community to the extent that we should
3073171 everyone on the no 20 lofton cattle team was on top of their game today
3073172 we had a great qualifying effort after our friday practice the team put an awesome set up under the car and did a great job this weekend
3073173 during the first pit stop wayne and my guys did a great job at adjusting the car
3073174 as i was coming up through the field i was very glad they didnt loosen me up too much nashville is an awesome track i had a lot of fun today i just wish we could have brought home the guitar all in all it was a great weekend for us and we will move on to springfield and let it rip in the dirt
3073175 the 01 caisse and the 16 allgaier were battling so hard in front of us that i was willing to settle for third and not risk getting taken out of the race
3073176 i knew if we had the chance we could get past the 01 and when the opportunity presented itself i took it we may not have led the race until the end but those are the most important laps to lead anyways
3073177 well we lost all our forward drive out but it the adjustments during the pit stop helped the center for sure
3073178 i think in the long run its going to be really good its just a handful right now
3073179 i think i had it at a 90 degree angle coming out of that turn it was so loose
3073180 im glad you can laugh at it it made me a little nervous up here they just showed your wiggle on the tv broadcast man you did have it sideways nice job there
3073181 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
3073182 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
3073183 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
3073184 at the start of the race i thought we were pretty darn good
3073185 we got up from 14th all the way into the top five i couldnt even tell rick ren crew chief what to do with it one lap it would be tight and then the next lap it would be loose rick made an awesome call staying out on tires thats what this vfw crew is all about when youre down and come out with a top five well take that we were a 20th place truck and finished fifth that says a lot for our team
3073186 we took on some damage in that first lap wreck and pitted we made adjustments that helped me run good on the bottom better than ive ever been able to run johnboy he is a real racer i do this for a hobby he cant stand to loose he is dedicated and works hard on the car he makes my job easier
3073187 the guys worked hard all day but we just came up a little short at the end i appreciate rcr letting the no 29 get a little extra practice for sundays cup race by pitting our car and shane wilson for calling a good race
3073188 on the incident with the 24 gordon and the 77 we were held up in a little traffic and we were racing for position toward the end and he gordon got beside me i gave him room on the outside but he didnt give me any room coming back to the left i was already in the dirt but i wasnt trying to bounce off of him that was the only choice i had then he got his feathers all ruffled up and decided he wanted to play at that point i just let him go we just didnt have a great car and thats just how it goes
3073189 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for
3073190 this should be unacceptable to all the democratic countries of the world and should draw us together in universal condemnation of russian aggression
3073191 americans wishing to spend august vacationing with their families or watching the olympics may wonder why their newspapers and television screens are filled with images of war in the small country of georgia

3073196 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe it is time we moved forward with a number of steps

3073199 wiped from the face of the earth ten osettian villages
3073200 the scale of cynicism is surprising and the skill to present white as black and black the trick to present the aggressor as the victim of an aggression and to place the responsibly for the effects on the victims
3073201 it is lamentable that some of our partners are not helping us but are trying to stand in the way i mean among other things the transfer of the georgian military contingent from iraq actually to the conflict zone by the military transport planes of the united states
3073202 nobody was listening and this is the result we have finally come to it however russia will of course carry out its peacekeeping mission to its logical end
3073203 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3073204 georgia must fulfil two fundamental conditions withdraw all of its armed units to the border of the safety zone stipulated by the 1992 agreement and sign an agreement on the non use of force with south ossetia

3073210 the divine office is the prayer of the mystical body of jesus christ offered to god
3073211 an earlier age these canonical prayers were attended by many of the faithful
3073212 no mention is made for example of how to incorporate this public prayer of the church into family life or even single life with its many activities
3073213 all christians in any state or walk of life are called to the fullness of christian life and to the perfection of love
3073214 the majority of bishops even suggested that the recitation of the office could be in the vernacular rather than in latin the official language of the church
3073215 chiefly responsible for the gradual demise of corporate daily prayer among ordinary members of the church in the west
3073216 continued to struggle with the burden the monasticised roman office placed on active clergy yet they were unable to break free of the monastic paradigm
3073217 the church must do something that is valuable for the whole church and not for special groups inside
3073218 would not recognize an office book if it fell on them
3073219 it would be safe to say that the liturgy of the hours has not become a regular feature of roman rite parochial liturgical life in the united states
3073220 there is variety in the liturgy of the hours and this devotion belongs as much to the laity as it does to priests and religious
3073221 this was not fully appreciated at the time of the second vatican council
3073222 the laity the liturgy of the hours and the second vatican council
3073223 we werent good enough in june we dont want to go another three years without winning anything again were a better team than that

3073225 i thought the first test in south africa was disappointing because we finished off last season on a massive high with the grand slam
3073226 i was hoping the boys would kick on and keep the winning mentality or good performances and give us something to build on
3073227 we just need to get our performances back up there and get back on track straight away

3073241 i wanted to built a site that was multi faceted that provides women with not just content and job opportunities but also acts as an interesting value proposition not only to women but to employers
3073242 my wish was to create a full service destination site for professional women who can talk about returning to work after parenting or gender issues in the workplace or discuss business opportunities
3073243 there arent a lot of searches that women perform that are unique to them today
3073244 thats not to say that they dont love the site its just been hard to find that audience

3073285 did you know that there have been 70 000 new chemicals introduced into our lives since 1940 and no one really knows what the effects really are of all of these chemicals we do know that many of us our actually malnourished no matter how much we eat because of these chemicals and the way food is processed it strips out all the nutrients and enzymes
3073286 in 1940 one pound of spinach contained about 158 mgm of iron in 1967 this fell to 27 7 mgm and today its less than 2 2 mgm
3073287 your body requires over two million red blood cells every second

3073318 the eu grand strategy is to develop georgia as an alternative route for caspian oil and gas by bypassing russia
3073319 but if georgia is no longer a safe passageway then all of these schemes for diminished dependency on russia go up in smoke
3073320 the first significant break in russias previous monopoly control over all oil and natural gas from the caspian sea states
3073321 azerbaijan and georgia for example rely on this pipeline for the political independence they often act out
3073322 an alternative pathway for the flow of caspian oil and gas to the west
3073323 georgia has been one of the leading recipients of u s military aid ever since
3073324 this of course infuriated the russians and they determined to try to curb georgias ties to the west in any way they possibly could

3073354 i dont know why the hell people smile when they see me i look so pathetic all my life i simply exist being a sharp and pointed thing good for nothing except hurting people or maybe they feel better about themselves after seeing my silly and ugly existence
3073355 the rose is unhappy for it assumed itself probably looking at the thorn all its life to be just a thorn and thus ignored the happiness that it deserved all these years
3073356 there are a few rules i know to be true about love and about marriage if you dont respect the other person you are going to have a lot of trouble if you dont know how to compromise you are going to have a lot of trouble if you cant talk openly about what goes on between you youre going to have a lot of trouble and if you do not share a common set of values in life you are going to have a lot of trouble
3073357 the greatest of these values is your belief in the importance of your marriage
3073358 we investigated a good number of systems suited to the applications in which we were interested narrowing it down to two for the live audition one of which was the electro voice phoenix
3073359 from the moment we heard the phoenix loudspeakers it was clear that they had just the sound we had been searching for high quality and well balanced it is so easy to set up the system position the speakers connect and go and it looks impressive the fact that it gives such clarity in the high and mid range whilst at the same time punching out incredible lows makes it ideal for the uses we have planned for namely the mid to large concert scene both indoor and outdoor
3073360 everything we wanted and more we had lots of comments about how good the sound was and have received many enquiries on the back of that event

3073376 we entered kfar darom this was the first time i was in gush katif i saw that it looked just like a kibbutz large lawns very nice one floor houses i had always thought that settlers meant caravans and poverty but suddenly i saw how beautiful the place was
3073377 we got to the houses of the families and then it became very very hard
3073378 at one point his father and brother said they refused to let any soldiers come into their house and that they would take the boy out by themselves
3073379 it was a traumatic experience my girl friends started to cry for the first time one of them next to me said youll hear these cries of his as youre giving birth it was truly jolting the cries of that boy are with me every day they really are
3073380 there was an ethiopian family that we moved out it really broke my heart i remember that there even i cried the father kept on giving his little daughter candies to give to us the people who came to take them out just so she wouldnt be afraid of us he asked to speak with all of us and explained that ever since he arrived from ethiopia by foot in operation solomon in 1991 he has been wandering in israel among different caravan neighborhoods and only here in kfar darom did he finally succeed in building his house he asked us not to take him out forcefully as he wanted to go out by himself he took his little daughter in his hands and his suitcase and when he reached the door he just broke down in tears and crying held on to the doorpost and simply refused to part where is he today did he ever recover from what we did to him did he end up wandering again among caravans i dont know but that moment was shocking it it something that you remember every day something you get up with in the morning if you ignore it and leave it aside everything is fine but when you really think about it and the pictures return it is shocking its alive and kicking and painful and burning
3073381 i hope the families and residents will forgive me first of all as a private individual who did this terrible thing and also as a citizen of this country
3073382 i hear much talks about additional evacuations of jewish towns and people and various concessions it seems to me that everyone can see what is happening in the place that we evacuated i remember that the chairman of my youth movement spoke to us during a seminar in preparation for the disengagement and said we are not happy at their misfortune we want to do something good if it turns out to be not good we will be strong enough to admit that we failed well i never heard that he asked forgiveness but if we have to be strong enough to admit that we failed then i feel that this move was a failure it was a wrong move
3073383 were not yet in our permanent homes we have not yet reached our rest and inheritance to come and say to us were sorry without doing something to repair what they did has no meaning the soldiers who feel bad about what they do have to tell their commanders in that well oiled machine that they will not take part in another expulsion and they must go the people they threw out of their homes and see what they can do for them and they must educate their future children not to take part in something like this
3073384 but rather a national correction that must be made the nation of israel has to know that if someone destroyed an area in the land of israel it doesnt get solved just by saying sorry when it comes to the destruction of the land of israel there is no forgiveness

3073410 guys like tom blumer cover what really matters and theyre independent enough to tell the truth without fear of aggravating corporate media owners
3073411 bizzyblog made my point with numbers and facts and stuff
3073412 this is why i read bizzy blog he catches the stuff that i manage to miss

3073417 women who breast feed cats and we saw a monkey licking a window
3073418 logos smack of seeking approval for what youre wearing and many customers now have enough confidence not to need that
3073419 id like to think that in some small part we played a role in that decision
3073420 fda states no significant difference in milk from cows treated with artificial growth hormones
3073421 universally people have congratulated us that we stuck by our guns because we still have the label
3073422 some consumers prefer to purchase milk from cows that have not been treated with growth hormone monsanto respects this choice but we want to make sure that consumers have all of the information they need to make this decision
3073423 monsanto is really used to throwing their muscle around and for stan bennett to choose to fight them that was an awesome thing
3073424 stan listened to the consumers and the consumer here has managed to change the industry and you dont often get that chance
3073425 there wasnt a lot of consumer knowledge about the growth hormone i think initially it was a very smart marketing technique
3073426 they dont like the idea that things are being put into our food supply that they dont know about or have control over
3073427 people want to know where their food is coming from and more than that they want to know how far away it was grown who grew it and how they can support those farmers
3073428 consumers want to be reassured that they know where their food is coming from and that the label means something that there is integrity in what is on the label
3073429 it did take our attention away from the day to day business and it was very expensive
3073430 but it raised our profile and it made us think about how we really do have not just a marketing interest but an obligation to do whats best for dairy consumers
3073431 in a sense weve become a victim of our own success
3073432 a lot of this issue is about marketing and perception
3073433 its been a positive thing because it promoted a maine product but it took away from maine farmers a production tool
3073434 were told to get more efficient and use modern technology and this was an example of that the people who used it really loved it then they were told they couldnt do it i have some farmers who are still very upset about it and some farmers who are resigned to it they grumbled but they did it
3073435 there are a lot of farmers who dont like the idea that milk can be set apart from other milk
3073436 it was important that stan bennett and the family stood up for the idea that there is a difference in producing milk
3073437 it has come and gone and we deal with the here and now
3073438 it is my goal to help restore our forest as a mother i feel that tree planting also helps ensure that the earth will be healthy and thriving long after our generation has passed and it will be our childrens turn to care for it
3073439 we are very proud to have been nominated by ms harris
3073440 we ask that people help us plant 1 5 million trees to restore wildfire damaged forests by going to the american express members project website and voting for our california wildfire releaf project
3073441 sldn is pleased the dnc platform committee calls for the repeal of dont ask dont tell and firmly advocates that all who are qualified be allowed to serve in the military without regard to their sexual orientation this is a bold and historic moment for all those who must serve in silence today and for all who believe in equality
3073442 at a time when the military is having a tough time recruiting and retaining troops it is wrong to deny our country the service of brave qualified people
3073443 sldn is grateful for the leadership of congresswoman tammy baldwin chair of the dnc platform drafting committee in working with us her efforts have elevated dont ask dont tell to a more visible position within the democratic party we will seek similar support within the republican party
3073444 the nevada county fairgrounds is proud to work with our local students high schools and 4 h clubs in developing both the ag mechanics auction and the junior livestock auction
3073445 the fairgrounds and the foundation are particularly focused on funding projects that will serve to support and develop our local youth in agriculture these two events as well as the creation of the foundation are examples of our commitment to our young exhibitors at the fair
3073446 has been poorly thought through badly implemented and has produced many unintended costs that will linger for years if not decades but blanket criticism of bush misses an important reality
3073447 whatever reasons and through whichever path the foreign policies in place now are more sensible moderate and mainstream in many cases the next president should follow rather then reverse them
3073448 the administration that became the target of so much passion and anger from democrats republicans independents foreigners martians everyone is not quite the one in place today the foreign policies that aroused the greatest anger and opposition were mostly pursued in bushs first term the invasion of iraq the rejection of treaties diplomacy and multilateralism in the last few years many of these policies have been modified abandoned or reversed this has happened without acknowledgment which is partly what drives critics crazy and its often been done surreptitiously it doesnt reflect a change of heart so much as an admission of failure the old way simply wasnt working
3073449 consider as a symbol of this shift bushs appointment of the world banks president his first choice for the job was paul wolfowitz an arch neoconservative with little background in economics but by the time wolfowitz was forced to resign and the post opened up again bush realized that he needed a less ideological choice and he picked the highly qualified and respected robert zoellick where dick cheney was once the poster child for the administration today policy is being run by condoleezza rice robert gates stephen hadley and hank paulson all pragmatists change has not extended to all areas and in many places its been too little too late but that there has been a shift to the center in many crucial areas of foreign policy is simply undeniable
3073450 that president of course was george w bush his decision to blindly repudiate anything associated with bill clinton is what got us into this mess in the first place lets hope that the next president no matter how much he despises bush will take a careful look at his administrations policies americas interests and the world beyond and do the right thing for the country and its future
3073451 i had grapes plums apricots almonds on the other side of the fence
3073452 they took it away about five years ago they said it was for security
3073453 i used to just prune my trees for a month and a half every year now i get two days access in total
3073454 he and others tried to gain access to the land but he said they were met by armed settlers who turned them away and since then he has become despondent about trying again
3073455 in the last six months not a single request by residents to access their land in the area was denied
3073456 they took away my income when they took my land
3073457 i got the beehives about five months ago and this is the first batch
3073458 i spend my time with the bees i have no land but i have something
3073459 this is a contribution to helping people be self sufficient
3073460 they are in a very vulnerable position because they have lost access to their land have little access to water or have lost their job
3073461 there are lots of rosemary bushes in the settlements and this is good for the honey
3073462 in the winter i want to plant my own rosemary
3073463 we have had lots of water problems in the last three years it wiped us out
3073464 we brought in an expert who found water underground we would have to dig about 30 metres to get the water
3073465 if i had access to the water id invest more in agriculture and give the rest of the water to my neighbours
3073466 we have so many problems but the jews settlers have all the water they want
3073467 p eople who ate the most processed meats were 50 more likely to develop colon cancer and 20 more likely to develop rectal cancer compared to those who ate the least
3073468 red meat and processed meat are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and there is also suggested evidence for some other cancers such as prostate cancer
3073469 increased consumption of processed meat is associated with an increased risk of stomach cancer
3073470 i find it suspicious that the only groups that are announced are the exact same ones that voted no in the first place
3073471 members of the group gary bolton scott getzschman and charlie janssen bolton and getzschman voted against a proposed ordinance janssen voted for the ordinance
3073472 i don t know why we re talking about something that already is illegal to me this is counter productive
3073473 residents are not satisfied with the pace of the recovery effort but they do see it moving in the right direction

3073481 this house is full of full of full of full of fight
3073482 my grandfather farmed with horses and i always said that if i had a place of my own i wanted to work it with horses
3073483 when we moved here some of our neighbors thought we were amish once the word got out that we were going to farm with horses some of the others probably thought we were crazy
3073484 some people have started to come around and ask what wed charge to cultivate their tobacco with the horses
3073485 with the price of gas i really think theres a growing interest in horses as a supplement to tractors
3073486 we sort of look at the farm as a small country and that we have to balance the exports and imports so that hopefully we come out on the positive side
3073487 we take organic sustenance away from the land when we produce cattle and hay but we try to put back just as much organic value as we take away and ideally put back even more
3073488 the pigs do a really good job of converting brushy areas
3073489 they kind of disc and cultivate the soil for us and we sow grass seed behind they as they go
3073490 theyre leaner and healthier because theyre eating what their bodies were designed for
3073491 when we lived in town we were both stressed out with our jobs always running around and always busy and never getting anywhere
3073492 why has the defensive forward been given such short shrift by the hall of fame
3073493 is it because defensive hockey isn t all that exciting and is an element of the game the league has been making countless efforts to move away from would it be embarrassing to induct a defensive forward as the average goals per game dwindles down into the low fives
3073494 greatness in the game of hockey should and does go beyond the obvious perusal of statistics
3073495 if the league gives out an award for defensive greatness among forwards
3073496 shouldn t the hall of fame recognize that greatness as well
3073497 one thing i love about nashville is people are proud of their teams and their city it has been a slap in the face for our fans but we don t know the full story and until we do it is going to be hard to comment on it
3073498 my entire right side from my knee to my chest is in pain
3073499 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3073500 unfortunately not everything has gone as expected as shes had
3073501 she views this as a sign that perhaps she should postpone the formal birthday bash and play it by ear instead she now reckons itll go ahead during a three day break in the tour towards the end of the month not next weekend

3073517 these poll results demonstrate that parents are as apprehensive about their childrens media diets as they are about traditional social issues such as alcohol drugs violence and sex
3073518 when it comes to video games parents should know that what they play is a resource that helps demystify one of the most popular and challenging forms of entertainment their kids are into
3073519 although these findings seem surprising at first they hint at fears parents have about video games
3073520 to some parents video games are full of unknowable dangers while researching for grand theft childhood parents we spoke with in focus groups often bemoaned the fact that they didnt know how to use game controls and felt unequipped to supervise or limit video game play of course parents dont want their children drinking alcohol but thats a more familiar risk

3073531 we started on pole went back to third went back to the front went back to third but it was fun everybody raced pretty clean for what it was really tight close racing i got bumped a whole bunch but i think everybody did

3073564 some sports such as weightlifting have a pretty bad record and that is demonstrated time and again with numerous athletes from that sport i think weightlifting understands as cycling understands that there is a huge risk for both those sports if the cheating is continued and continued to be exposed there is no sport that anybody can suggest is doping free but there are some sports that have had a history and i would suggest theres a level or a culture of doping that has developed in some of those sports

3073570 airlines everywhere are struggling with the current price of oil but the solution to their problems should not lie in an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to less competition and higher fares
3073571 ba aa would have a combination of high frequencies and a transatlantic network that could not be replicated by any other airline alliance and which would make it impossible for other carriers to compete for time sensitive corporate or business travellers

3073573 she was a bit more shy than some of the other kids and very much enjoys time on her own
3073574 but when shes with the artery program shes a totally different kid not shy very outgoing and bubbly
3073575 i think its her way of communicating she connects to it and shannon and jane love it so much that its sort of their communication they all understand each other
3073576 so this is a great opportunity for some one on one interaction and the art has really been helpful for expressing how youre feeling and its an emotional outlet for her

3073581 a lot of the kids cognitively are not able to really discern this and that but they can smell

3073600 i cracked the door open but they pushed me out of the way
3073601 theres no disputing we may suppose that abortion is indeed prohibited by morality bob
3073602 that thing we were just both talking about you are in error about it
3073603 do you think that this is something of which most humans ought to be persuadable
3073604 yes i do and i dont think thats because im a psychopath by common human standards i think most humans would come to agree with me if they knew the facts i knew and heard the same moral arguments ive heard
3073605 i think then that we must have a moral disagreement since we both believe ourselves to be a shared moral frame of reference on this issue and yet our moral intuitions say different things to us
3073606 well it is not logically necessary that we have a genuine disagreement we might be mistaken in believing ourselves to mean the same thing by the words right and wrong since neither of us can introspectively report our own moral reference frames or unfold them fully
3073607 but if the meaning is similar up to the third decimal place or sufficiently similar in some respects that it ought to be delivering similar answers on this particular issue then even if our moralities are not in principle identical i would not hesitate to invoke the intuitions for transpersonal morality
3073608 i agree until proven otherwise i am inclined to talk about this question as if it is the same question unto us
3073609 so i say abortion is wrong without further qualification or specialization on what wrong means unto me
3073610 and i think that abortion is right we have a disagreement then and at least one of us must be mistaken
3073611 unless were actually choosing differently because of in principle unresolvable differences in our moral frame of reference as if one of us were a paperclip maximizer in that case we would be mutually mistaken in our belief that when we talk about doing what is right we mean the same thing by right we would agree that we have a disagreement but we would both be wrong
3073612 we have nothing to argue about we are only different optimization processes
3073613 perhaps richard means that we could suppose that abortion is indeed prohibited by morality bob
3073614 i know the answer and now let me justify it
3073615 we have nothing to argue about we are only different optimization processes
3073616 but this would be an extreme position to take with respect to your fellow humans and i recommend against doing so even a psychopath would still be in a common moral reference frame with you if fully informed they would decide to take a pill that would make them non psychopaths if you told me that my ability to care about other people was neurologically damaged and you offered me a pill to fix it i would take it
3073617 i do not eat steak because i am uncertain of what my own morality outputs with respect to steak eating it seems reasonable to me to imagine that cows are capable of experiencing pain of fearing death of being and ceasing to be if you are like the majority of human beings you do eat steak the propositions i have suggested do not seem reasonable to you
3073618 rather it is essential to the concept of morality that it involves shared standards common to all fully reasonable agents
3073619 when a paperclip maximizer and a pencil maximizer do different things they are not disagreeing about anything they are just different optimization processes
3073620 as such we shouldnt expect much more moral agreement from humans than from rational or approximately rational ais
3073621 as such on ethical questions that had no precedent in our eea we shouldnt expect much more moral agreement from humans than from rational or approximately rational ais apart of course from the fact that most humans share a common set of cognitive biases
3073622 ive known chet since he played with my son and i think a lot of what he accomplished was based on his own perseverance
3073623 with a young fellow like chet a lot of times it can be hard for a player to take on the role of starting goalie i know these things because ive seen it happen a thousand times myself and with carey
3073624 i tried to get chet to step back and see things from my perspective i really cheered for him like i cheer for my own son
3073625 the whl is a tough league to play in primarily because of the travel its hard because players can be several thousand miles away from home plus those hours spent traveling all night on a bus these are very important parts of being a hockey player
3073626 i think carey really respects olaf you have to respect a person who has had the amount of success that hes had
3073627 when youre a parent youve seen them grow in to what they are its all been a process its like going from midget to junior and because youve been with them the whole time youre proud
3073628 what i like to do is go to the practices
3073629 there are a lot of guys kovalev obviously that guy is so skilled its unbelievable
3073630 one of the guys even though he was traded is cristobal huet he was just a terrific guy and a very positive influence on carey
3073631 at that point you dont know whether to laugh or cry because all of a sudden carey is stuck in that spot but thats the type of situation that carey likes its what he wants
3073632 ive only met bob a couple of times bob is pretty straight faced pretty quiet you dont get too much out of bob in terms of small talk or information

3073644 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3073645 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3073646 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3073647 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3073648 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3073649 do nothing unless there is strong evidence that you should do something
3073650 so i should probably need to send over the records from the previous so the doctor can know what methods didnt work
3073651 well each doctor has his own method for determining what to do
3073652 but this is all based on some rigorous procedure for determining what to do which is based on a statistical analysis of all past steroidal injection methods right
3073653 is it more methodical than rolling dice to decide what to do
3073654 what difference does it make that we dont know why the extra chemo group has more remissions so long as they did
3073655 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3073656 karina meets her savior and unable to go on she does anyway
3073657 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3073658 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3073659 tragically and unfortunately these latest complaints vindicate the serious recommendations we made years ago
3073660 we issued a scathing report that left no doubt about this physician arbitrarily denying medically necessary care to patients
3073661 dr benet devised a plan to bilk pmi of its assets and profit personally
3073662 this report presents a picture of a physician driven by the promise of wealth to disregard health needs
3073663 if you look at the consent decree it really comes down to technical documentation issues
3073664 in neither case did any harm come to the patient from anything i did or didnt do
3073665 i couldnt walk i couldnt talk i was not a good mother i couldnt function
3073666 not an hour goes by that i dont get hit up
3073667 you know all of a sudden im considering getting a tongue stud
3073668 it feels like a cheat an evasion a con game for stunted children
3073669 now games are important they test us they teach us comradeship theyre fun but cricket more than any other sport is i want to say a lesson in civility
3073670 i read to know the world in particular the human world even to celebrate it not to slum in another

3073674 understanding how elephants and other animal populations react to droughts will be a central component of wildlife management and conservation
3073675 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3073676 climate change is expected to lead to a higher occurrence of severe drought in africa and our study suggests that such extreme climatic events may act as a selection force on animal populations as animals battle to cope certain individuals such as these grand dames of the elephant kingdom might become increasingly important
3073677 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference
3073678 the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia
3073679 hopefully this study underlines the importance of how crucial older matriarchs are to the health of elephant populations
3073680 protecting the leaders of elephant herds will be even more important in what may be an increase in droughts due to climate change
3073681 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3073682 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3073683 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future there are already drugs that inhibit particular ptks in the late stages of treatment our discovery could change the timing of when and how those or similar drugs are administered
3073684 our studies have shown that ptk pathways are intimately associated with the regulation of checkpoint responses during dna replication
3073685 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication they may lack a key enzyme called tcptp
3073686 but the big question remains what happens in the real world of human cancers
3073687 we now have a central mechanism we can use as a tool to look for triggers in the genome that work with hox and sens to regulate the formation of neurons and blood cells
3073688 this allows us to identify other key genes downstream of hox and sens determine their role in development based on what happens with cell fate decisions and look for the causes of birth defects and disease

3073693 dedico este pr mio minha filha lili minha esposa lilian e a oscarito que me levou ao mundo do cinema
3073694 o primeiro blog que conheci foi o da clarah e esse estilo de narrativa me interessou
3073695 existe essa busca de encontrar algo diferente no tema essa coisa estranha que o brasileiro tem com a internet
3073696 descobri que fiz um filme sobre o transbordamento feminino queria falar mais sobre a paix o na mulher
3073697 a obra da clarah est intacta s o inst ncias que correm em paralelo
3073698 eu a escolhi por acaso n o por sua literatura
3073699 fui bem atr s de fazer este filme j que o murilo queria trabalhar com uma atriz desconhecida para dar credibilidade mas mostrei a ele que sou atriz e poderia fazer o papel
3073700 o filme fala da minha gera o sem ser necessariamente jovem
3073701 a constru o da personagem se deu entre mim e o murilo busquei as refer ncias na literatura dela foi a primeira vez que li john fante na m sica tamb m sa bastante na noite paulistana sozinha isso me ajudou bastante al m disso fiquei morando uma semana no apartamento onde ocorreram as filmagens
3073702 durante a leitura do roteiro fui ganhando confian a questionei e sugeri coisas como nas situa es mais feminina
3073703 o filme exigia que eu confiasse muito no murilo apostasse no que ele propunha mas as filmagens foram muito punk algumas vezes nos intervalos eu nem conseguia me mexer acho que nunca mais farei um filme que seja t o centrado no meu personagem
3073704 filmar foi como um ritual foi criada uma situa o de intimidade foi um processo meio documental
3073705 a clarah tem essa rela o com a fic o no blog que me fascinava esse paradoxo sempre me fascinou assim como a exposi o e o aprisionamento que ela vivia
3073706 tenho um computador desde os 13 anos ent o n o precisei de laborat rio em rela o a isso
3073707 ningu m pergunta para quem faz playboy como foi ficar nua n o sei por que isso desperta tanta curiosidade no meu caso estou o tempo inteiro nua neste filme mesmo quando estou vestida o nu s era dif cil quando estava muito frio
3073708 the list is pretty long and if you look at renewables wind definitely is getting stronger and has been developing very very fast definitely china has been producing manufacturing a lot of solar pv mostly exporting to the developing world at this moment looking at a lot of other applications like solar water heaters china definitely is among the largest one in the world and then down the list and there is like biofuels which is still controversial internationally but somehow china is also developing fast hydro is definitely on the list and china has been leading the technology in hydroelectricity and not only the large hydro but also the small and medium sized hydrotechnology as well unfortunately china has to rely on coal mostly for its power but whats encouraging for us to see is that the government and also the companies in china are investing heavily in clean coal technology so if you look at the clean coal technology that has been used worldwide china is pretty much leading already
3073709 the fact is that china today has to continue to rely on the coal but in the meantime we all know the coal factory is not only the major source of greenhouse gases but also domestic pollution and so for the government basically its very very crucial to look for alternatives so investing heavily in the renewable energy sector is part of the national strategy to shift the countrys reliance on coal to other cleaner options

3073740 the eu grand strategy is to develop georgia as an alternative route for caspian oil and gas by bypassing russia
3073741 but if georgia is no longer a safe passageway then all of these schemes for diminished dependency on russia go up in smoke
3073742 the first significant break in russias previous monopoly control over all oil and natural gas from the
3073743 azerbaijan and georgia for example rely on this pipeline for the political independence they often act out

3073786 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
3073787 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
3073788 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
3073789 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
3073790 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
3073791 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
3073792 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe

3073794 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
3073795 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
3073796 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
3073797 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you

3073844 generally the elections there were very very peaceful the turnout is very very good
3073845 the renewed fighting in north cotabato goes to show that when the government bungles the peace negotiations it is the citizens who suffer

3073852 a vivid and compelling demonstration of americas ability to win swift and total victory
3073853 unequalled in its excellence by anything in the annals of war
3073854 that far surpasses the capabilities of such previous would be hegemons as rome britain and napoleonic france
3073855 fabled generals such as erwin rommel and heinz guderian seem positively incompetent by comparison
3073856 weve applied the new powers of technology to strike an enemy force with speed and incredible precision by a combination of creative strategies and advanced technologies we are redefining war on our terms in this new era of warfare we can target a regime not a nation
3073857 the american people fell in love again with their armed forces
3073858 whats the point of having this superb military that youre always talking about if we cant use it
3073859 appropriated the entire earth and was ready to flood the most obscure areas of it with troops at a moments notice
3073860 just about no mission is impossible for the united states military

3073873 he said my life has changed my life has been changed but he did not understand it at all
3073874 what the story establishes is both the placid surface of small town respectability and the violent undercurrent of passion and violation that wells up naturally in the underclass but is kept appropriately repressed
3073875 large personal vehicles regardless of whether they are electrically powered or not are not sustainable
3073876 obama give us hope we are the change we are looking for
3073877 cut consumption while embarking on a serious program of alternative fuels and energy sources
3073878 as long as the media keeps miscovering the subject any serious political leader will have to agree to some meaningless drilling to get a serious clean energy program passed
3073879 if oil prices did drop after releasing maybe 70 million barrels that would vindicate this strategy if oil prices did not drop that would demonstrate how useless the strategic reserve is
3073880 the fact is that coal has doubled in cost in the last year alone dramatically affecting aep ohios costs
3073881 the tools given to us by the states new energy plan allow us to phase in those fuel price increases over time so that unlike the spikes ohioans see in so many products aep ohios rate increases are spread out to be made more affordable
3073882 im not convinced well see a new nuclear station before probably the 2020 timeline

3073888 imagine trucks hauling the nations nuclear waste on our highways to yucca mountain
3073889 john mccain supports opening yucca hes not worried about nuclear waste in our state only in arizona
3073890 what people forget is the option of leaving this waste in areas outside maybe unprotected certainly not well protected all over america rather than having it in a safe and secure repository for it
3073891 i preferred not having the status quo and i think it is a national security issue
3073892 some of these same gene regulatory networks are re activated in the adult to direct the growth of new blood vessels
3073893 this can be beneficial as in the case of a heart attack
3073894 finding that a single factor regulates a large part of the angiogenic process creates a significant target for therapeutic development for any disease involving the vascular system

3073896 even the scientists themselves admit that they cant explain everything the bible on the other hand has all the answers god explains everything so thats where im placing my bets

3073898 we have very common sense measures that anybody can do and kind of understand that it will make a difference
3073899 i think we need to focus on how we can be good stewards and do the little things that add up and change peoples habits but were not going to shamelessly pander

3073901 position of the city of bloomington environmental commission on economic growth in the united states
3073902 this position statement acknowledges that the human economy is contained within and dependent on a finite and depletable natural environment
3073903 ever increasing economic growth ultimately leads to resource consumption and waste production at rates greater than can be sustained by nature
3073904 an examination of the costs associated with residential growth in bloomington
3073905 the commissions report illustrates that the city incurs real costs that are associated with residential growth
3073906 the commission would like to see the costs of growth balanced against the benefits and incorporated into the decision making process in order to promote sustainable development in bloomington
3073907 if that happens youll see this budget dug in and youll see the longest impasse ever and thats unfortunate

3073919 seventy per cent of the antibiotics administered in america end up in agriculture
3073920 the drugs are not used to cure sick animals but to prevent them from getting sick because we crowd them together under filthy circumstances we have created the perfect environment in which to breed superbugs that are antibiotic resistant weve created a petri dish in our factory farms for the evolution of dangerous pathogens

3073924 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
3073925 bij de meeste brandweerkorpsen is er zelfs geen minimumbezetting om de basisopdrachten uit te voeren
3073926 brandweerkorpsen zijn nog samengesteld zoals dat dertig jaar geleden het geval was het houdt absoluut geen rekening met de risicos van vandaag we zijn dikwijls serieus onderbemand bij brandweerinterventies wat gevaarlijk is voor de bevolking en voor de brandweermannen zelf
3073927 en in het hele land kan je hetzelfde vaststellen ondanks de beloften na de ramp in gellingen in 2004 kwam er geen verbetering in de nieuwe wet van 2007 over de civiele veiligheid is een herwaardering voorzien van het statuut van de brandweerman ook zou er gezorgd worden voor een minimumbezetting bij alle korpsen de wet op zich is goed maar de middelen ontbreken het oneindig gepalaver over institutionele hervormingen verbetert de veiligheid van de burger niet

3073938 we are praying that revival will come down and that jews and arabs will worship together
3073939 jesus prayed for unity of believers and we are hoping this will bring believers of all backgrounds who are coming together to worship
3073940 the message has gone out to the world notes andre mubarak another of upper room ministries elders but
3073941 the most unique aspect are the hosts spirit filled palestinian arab believers all born in israel and raised in orthodox christian or catholic homes while christians are already a small minority in the land spirit filled born again arabs are an even smaller minority
3073942 the west is great but we need to start doing things by ourselves

3073949 slaughterhouse five or the childrens crusade a duty dance with death by kurt vonnegut jr
3073950 it is so short and jumbled and jangled because there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre
3073951 every day my government gives me a count of corpses created by military science in vietnam
3073952 billy made a noise like a small rusty hinge he had just emptied his seminal vesicles into valencia
3073953 you neednt worry about bombs by the way dresden is an open city it is undefended and contains no war industries or troop concentrations of any importance
3073954 nothing happened that night it was the next night that about one hundred and thirty thousand people in dresden would die
3073955 not many americans knew how much worse it had been than hiroshima for instance i didnt know that either there hadnt been much publicity
3073956 as a student in the 1960s like so many others of my age i had learned of the citys destruction principally through a work of fiction kurt vonneguts acidly surreal masterpiece slaughterhouse five
3073957 made from the fat of rendered jews and gypsies and fairies and communists and other enemies of the state
3073958 like frederick taylor i grew up with a sense that the rafs bombing of dresden on 13 14 february 1945 was a stain on the allies war record my unease owed much to kurt vonneguts novelised memoir of his experience in dresden as an american pow forced to disinter the corpses of german civilians who had been suffocated or baked to death in cellars beneath the ruins of their once beautiful city i read slaughterhouse five in one sitting and it has haunted me since
3073959 used to relativise and so diminish the scale and singularity of atrocities perpetrated by the german army the luftwaffe and the ss between 1939 and 1945
3073960 in 2002 j rg friedrich published der brand an account of how ordinary germans experienced the air war
3073961 last year the late wg sebalds controversial lectures on the natural history of destruction appeared in english arguing that germans had repressed memories of the air raids
3073962 in spite of strenuous efforts to come to terms with the past as people like to put it it seems to me that we germans today are a nation strikingly blind to history and lacking in tradition
3073963 although his lectures concentrated on the alleged failure of post war writers to describe the destruction and carnage caused by bombing sebald deployed terms such as
3073964 at the heart of frederick taylors new book on the attack on dresden lies a very simple argument the bombing of dresden was justified
3073965 taylors book is part of a wave of revisionist histories of the second world war
3073966 taylor rubbishes the argument that the bombing was carried out in the knowledge that the end of the war was in sight
3073967 the raid was part of a bombing campaign that all but destroyed cities across germany ordinary workers were just a part of the war machine that the allies were out to destroy as such they were not even seen as collateral damage but as legitimate targets
3073968 the second world war wasnt just a war about destroying german fascism
3073969 the bombing of major cities did not contribute the knockout blow that bombing planners like harris promised
3073970 in such a war of revenge attacks ordinary people in enemy countries were not seen as potential allies they were not seen as an important force that could potentially undermine totalitarian regimes from within they were legitimate targets and at the end of that line of logic came hiroshima and nagasaki
3073971 that and were at that very time falling on england killing civilian men women and children indiscriminately as they were designed and launched to do it might be well to remember buchenwald and coventry too
3073972 this is perhaps the great still unanswered question about germany and the german people between 1933 and 1945 with the vast material and spiritual riches of places like dresden at your disposal why place all that at risk by launching a ruthless in large part genocidal attack on the rest of europe did anyone really expect the world to fight back while wearing kid gloves in order not to damage germanys artistic treasures or kill german civilians
3073973 across europe and all around the world people are gathering to express their preference for peace and torture
3073974 all this happiness on display is suspect everyone is thrilled to be together on the streets people are hugging themselves it seems as well as each other if they think and they could be right that continued torture and summary executions ethnic cleansing and occasional genocide are preferable to an invasion they should be sombre in their view
3073975 his attitude is as strong and pure as his bones and skin so strong he doesnt feel much need to go tramping through the streets to make his point

3073979 i understand what gordon brown means when he says he finds it difficult to believe a word that blair says which is odd because i didnt feel that a year ago when i was forced out it was the publication last summer of the butler report which changed everything for me
3073980 in the smile of a self conscious liar certain muscle groups in the face are not activated
3073981 the first and best unconscious move of a dedicated liar is to persuade himself hes sincere and once hes sincere all deception vanishes
3073982 the prime minister is giving his glasgow speech perowne touches the control in time to hear him say that the number of marchers today has been exceeded by the number of deaths caused by saddam a clever point the only case to make but it should have been made from the start too late now after blix it looks tactical
3073983 no matter how many people in britain went to services of remembrance on holocaust memorial day that will still be less than the number of people who died in the death camps

3073986 as far as henry is concerned jay is the key to the success of his firm
3073987 iraq is a rotten state a natural ally of terrorists bound to cause mischief at some point and may as well be taken out now while the us military is feeling perky after afghanistan and by taken out he insists that he means liberated and democratised the usa has to atone for its previous disastrous policies at the very least it owes this to the iraqi people
3073988 whenever he talks to jay henry finds himself tending towards the anti war camp
3073989 has been holding forth on the necessity of the coming war
3073990 reluctant to voice his pacifist views for fear of being taken apart
3073991 the debris has a certain archaeological interest a not in my name with a broken stalk lies among polystyrene cups and abandoned hamburgers and pristine fliers for the british association of muslims on a pile he steps round are a slab of pizza with pineapple slices beer cans in a tartan motif a denim jacket empty milk cartons and three unopened tins of sweetcorn
3073992 every twenty four hours about thirty four thousand children die in the world from the effects of poverty from malnutrition and disease basically thirty four thousand from a world a world society that could feed and clothe and treat them all with a workably different allocation of resources meanwhile the latest estimate is that two thousand eight hundred people died in the twin towers so its like that image that ghastly grey billowing double barrelled fall repeated twelve times every single fucking day twenty four towers one per hour throughout each day and night full of children

3073996 if the hijackers had been able to imagine themselves into the thoughts and feelings of the passengers they would have been unable to proceed it is hard to be cruel once you permit yourself to enter the mind of your victim imagining what it is like to be someone other than yourself is at the core of our humanity it is the essence of compassion and it is the beginning of morality
3073997 the hijackers used fanatical certainty misplaced religious faith and dehumanising hatred to purge themselves of the human instinct for empathy among their crimes was a failure of the imagination

3074052 if california voters reject the amendment banning gay marriage it will be the first significant popular affirmation of gay marriage
3074053 they also run the risk of taking much needed resources and attention away from other types of laws that could protect women and their unborn children immediately
3074054 in a down turning economy white voters may be looking for someone to blame for job losses or their poor financial situation
3074055 many of these conservative measures be they abortion affirmative action or gay marriage may be very risky for mccain to touch directly because voters are very focused on the economy and the war
3074056 mccain will have to use proxies to play up these issues because his own stances on these issues have not always been so clear
3074057 every six months there is an announcement that taxes dont matter anymore
3074058 there are a lot of ifs anybody who can divine it is a lot smarter than me
3074059 we feel pretty strongly that a lot of the seats are being rented by the democrats and theyll be giving them back
3074060 we have every reason to believe thats going to bode well for us this year
3074061 why arent the ds doing better in florida when theyre picking up seats nationally its reapportionment
3074062 a good candidate who speaks to the needs of the constituents can win
3074063 we have seen democrats in republican performing seats prevail a lot of it depends on the candidate and how hard they are willing to work
3074064 there are a lot of ifs anybody who can divine it is a lot smarter than me
3074065 we feel pretty strongly that a lot of the seats are being rented by the democrats and theyll be giving them back
3074066 we have every reason to believe thats going to bode well for us this year
3074067 why arent the ds doing better in florida when theyre picking up seats nationally its reapportionment
3074068 the florida democratic party should not open the door even a tiny bit to republican mischief since we know based on 2000 that the republicans will spend millions on legal fees in challenges in order to win
3074069 consequently we must dot every i and cross every t in the proper manner to immunize us from republican attack
3074070 create good jobs lower homeowner insurance rates and gas prices thats why theyre joining our party in record numbers
3074071 democrats have focused on registering anybody with a heartbeat not necessarily people who are going to participate in the democratic process
3074072 republicans in florida have always had a very strong get out the vote structure at election time
3074073 if he wants to live through the eight years hell live through it
3074074 thats a really tough question not ever having run a country
3074075 im not going to run for election or anything but i feel real good
3074076 if i get up and down on my knees on that concrete they kill me
3074077 i cant remember like i did 10 years ago its just different things when you try to think of them they dont come to you as quick
3074078 i think he could do the job in his 90s i think he would be all right
3074079 because i am his age and i think i have an ability to look at facts and make a good decision
3074080 i do know that if it were mitt romney instead of john edwards this would be on the front page of the new york times
3074081 we have come full circle and today our jails are once again psychiatric warehouses
3074082 are now the fastest growing segment of the publicly funded mental health marketplace in florida
3074083 something different than that young boy who grew up in a small town in north carolina
3074084 because that young boy would never have done this never thought about doing it
3074085 my first reaction was of all the people not john edwards
3074086 he just fell into a trap that we can all fall into
3074087 i would treat him no differently but he would be snubbed by some people at church this morning our sunday school teacher said a lot of people didnt back him anyway
3074088 no matter what your party affiliation if someone from your town is successful you hate it
3074089 ive gone beyond the extremes of what i should and shouldnt have done
3074090 that every male on the 11 7 overnight shift has told him that they have violated the internet use policy
3074091 he stated that after getting the e mail about blocked web sites from djj headquarters everyone he knew was asking how do we get around this
3074092 admitted he also used the internet to access his personal e mail complete homework and to conduct extensive research on witchcraft
3074093 ill pick up a gallon of milk on the way home
3074094 the lobbyists running his low road campaign the money billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies but almost nothing for families like yours lurching to the right then the left the old washington dance whatever it takes john mccain a washington celebrity playing the same old washington games
3074095 you dont learn from mistakes if you think youre the exception
3074096 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
3074097 i did it independently i never talked to john edwards about it they just needed to get out of town
3074098 ive been seeing people like for example presumptive republican nominee john mccain talk about the mistakes that hes made in his past in respect to his first marriage and left it i think basically at that
3074099 it was just interesting to me that here we are trying to promote peace and harmony and were witnessing a conflict take place
3074100 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3074101 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3074102 it was just interesting to me that here we are trying to promote peace and harmony and were witnessing a conflict take place
3074103 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3074104 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3074105 i have seen the miserable state of my people in egypt
3074106 i have heard their appeal to be free of their slave drivers
3074107 who am i to go to pharaoh and bring the people of israel out of egypt
3074108 but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
3074109 the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
3074110 and now he embraces the failed bush policies over the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick
3074111 it was always going to have to be a part of our campaign for the general election
3074112 sure hes been in washington 26 years but hes always been a reformer always worked across party lines sacrificed his own political interests to do so
3074113 so we were always going to have to tell that narrative because some people know it but not everybody
3074114 he can point to areas where he broke with the bush administration where he broke with his own party
3074115 that part of the maverick image probably isnt going away
3074116 the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
3074117 john mccain has changed hes taken the low road leveling false negative and misleading attacks against barack obama
3074118 it was narrated in the first person from the point of view of the ostensibly jaded cocaine addled sexually voracious 20 year old who was shall we say inspired by lisa
3074119 for me youre a little bit frozen in time a little bit alison poole the 21 year old party girl in that book who runs around new york going to nightclubs doing drugs and abusing credit cards
3074120 thats definitely a theme in my life seeker of truth
3074121 rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
3074122 the sweetest most caring person one could ever hope to meet
3074123 whose behavior intrigued and appalled me to such an extent that i ended up basing a novel on the experience
3074124 most of the guys i know have really high powered jobs and make up for lost time when theyre not in the office the berserk after work club i seem to attract them in a big way all these boys in paul stuart suits with six figure salaries and hellfire on a dimmer switch in their eyes
3074125 on may 4th 2004 enlightenment happened meaning i realized i am what ive been looking for
3074126 more than 115 000 florida ex convicts have regained the right to vote in the past 15 months and 1 000 are applying each month to have their rights restored
3074127 hi im calling on behalf of the florida republican party and john mccain the 27 year old said hunched over a stack of papers one night last week with a cell phone pressed to his cheek
3074128 currently in the race for president do you support john mccain barack obama or are you undecided john mccain okay
3074129 whatever theyre doing on the grass roots campaign clearly is not working said republican consultant doug mcalarney of tallahassee
3074130 its clear if they want to run a grass roots campaign they have to do something different
3074131 steve schale the veteran florida strategist leading obamas florida campaign
3074132 i would consider a draft if it could be made fairer than the viet nam era version in which many avoided any risk of being called up using deferments
3074133 wait till it comes out that i had an affair with a man
3074134 he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
3074135 currently in the race for president do you support john mccain barack obama or are you undecided
3074136 i think were going to be very steady at our early voting sites thats what were preparing for
3074137 but the turnout for early voting is traditionally about the same as in absentee at least in volusia
3074138 of course the primary doesnt really have a central focus theres no one intense issue or candidate on the ballot
3074139 what separates me from all the field i have the experience of working in that environment
3074140 i know members members know me thats why the democratic congressional committee spent time recruiting me for the seat
3074141 i dont think we need anyone to be preordained to be successful in congress
3074142 i dont think serving as a reservists a couple of weeks a year in the pentagon necessarily is important to understanding nasas role in our country
3074143 we could eliminate the 15 to 25 percent overhead in profit from the current system and the institute of medicine estimates that we could save 1 8 billion a year by treating people when they need to be treated rather than after the fact when it was too late
3074144 people have more parking space and might feel more comfortable coming early to use the new computer system
3074145 people want to avoid the big rush they prefer to vote at their own pace
3074146 or voters can check an interactive demo of the new voting system online at
3074147 its really easy as a first time voter i can say it all was faster than i thought
3074148 early voting is so new the archival information is just not large enough to make an extrapolation about what it means for voter turnout but its extremely popular
3074149 people have more parking space and might feel more comfortable coming early to use the new computer system
3074150 people want to avoid the big rush they prefer to vote at their own pace
3074151 or voters can check an interactive demo of the new voting system online at
3074152 its really easy as a first time voter i can say it all was faster than i thought
3074153 the philosophy of throwing them out or making a change doesnt seem to be filtering down in these cases
3074154 thats something you hear about more on the national level
3074155 there was a lot more hubbub at this point this year were just not seeing it
3074156 so many times its the primary winner who wins the seat
3074157 i think this primary is a really exciting time in lee county history voters have the opportunity to shape local government for years to come just look at law enforcement we have a sheriffs race and a public defenders race thats two major branches of law enforcement then youve got county commission and school board its huge and with turnout usually so low every persons vote really matters
3074158 one thing i learned is that theres always a simple answer until you get in there and start learning a little more about it and you find out things are not as simple as you think at least we have people in there now who know how the county works in tough economic times when were looking at budget cuts its not a time for learning on the job
3074159 youve got shawn seliger whos talking about listening more to the builders and youve got frank mann who says hes staying where he is
3074160 respect for egalitarian values prompts me to care for the just treatment of all people
3074161 the fundamental issue was whether ag mart controlled these commercial motels
3074162 it wasnt a good day for us we know that
3074163 the reality is if you had to bet there is a good chance the district court will lower the award
3074164 we dont want to get into moral issues at this point
3074165 we are bringing them here to talk about the election and to talk about elizabeths battle with cancer and that to us was more than enough to captivate an audience
3074166 hes a public figure so he needs to give us more information about the case
3074167 i dont think that his personal life should be anyone elses business hopefully no one brings it up because his wife is going to be there and its going to be uncomfortable for her
3074168 i knew about the salem witch trials because i have identified with those witches a time or two
3074169 i think the question goes more to the speaker than to the college
3074170 the college booked senator edwards because hes high profile it didnt book him based on his moral standing
3074171 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
3074172 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
3074173 barack obama is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate campaign manager david plouffe says in a weekend email to obama supporters
3074174 you can be part of this important movement it appears this message was sent to the media but too late they already are daily obama piece number one
3074175 dear lord protect me from my friends i will take care of my enemys mtself
3074176 frankly im surprised uf still uses it as a factor
3074177 using legacy data in admissions particularly at institutions that were at some point in their history segregated by race is very controversial
3074178 legacy is a question we ask but if thats all youre bringing to the table will it get you in alone no you need a lot more
3074179 its one of those dirty little secrets in admissions that helps increase donations to the school and breed more alumni
3074180 in the end its a net gain for the school
3074181 its just too competitive of a world to give an advantage to someone not based on their own merit
3074182 im sure though alumni affairs would like us to use it
3074183 alumni dont try to bribe us any more than anyone else does
3074184 as a young university it is important for ucf to build traditions and that is one way to do so
3074185 los stocks mundiales de granos se reducir n a un m nimo hist rico en relaci n con el volumen de consumo
3074186 i believe that if you have a major felony conviction whether its cocaine trafficking or mortgage fraud you should not be in a position of trust such as a mortgage broker would have with access to personal financial data and with opportunity to steal from people
3074187 it seems me that there should be a period of time after which you come out of prison that youre not given the right to have a license in professions that have that type of quality
3074188 what this investigation did to us good guys the white hat wearing brokers is that it devalued our license
3074189 there needs to be an iron wall between the consumer and a felon in dealing with mortgages
3074190 the debt for a persons wrongs can be paid in full people can be forgiven by their creator
3074191 he arranged nearly 3 million in fraudulent loans and fleeced 30 people many of them elderly and disabled
3074192 the key to this is proper hiring techniques and doing proper background investigations
3074193 to me the focus should be on the people in charge
3074194 in this case the focus does need to be on people who have been convicted of financial related crimes
3074195 just like you dont want to give firearms authority back to someone who has committed armed robbery
3074196 then we need to give people that second chance otherwise we might be forcing them back into a life of crime and thats not what we want to do we believe in rehabilitation
3074197 if that means we purge all white collar criminals from our ranks great if it means removing all criminals thats probably better but what we have to have is swift action we have to reinstate trust in the profession
3074198 i would generally support the attorney general on this for consumer protection
3074199 but there may be unintended consequences its a bit of a broad brush there are many felonies that had nothing to do with fraud that give you no reason to think theyd be involved in mortgage fraud
3074200 you might be preventing someone from rehabilitating themselves and getting their lives back on track
3074201 he saw this as an opening since its a hot political topic
3074202 its an emotional appeal not a logical one we know that nationwide the majority of people that created the foreclosure crisis are not people previously convicted of a crime this is simply a drop in the bucket of the larger problem of foreclosures
3074203 but i certainly would not have raised this but for the fact that it has direct bearing on the issue at hand im interested in the safety and security of the people of florida thats what they elected me to do i would be very remiss if i didnt do this
3074204 i hope that by them seeing me on the commission they can feel more involved in the city
3074205 this is a person who is committed to the lives of everyone in delray and he has demonstrated this by his actions
3074206 walking to school you get to see a lot of things in the community the good and the bad
3074207 you can help them and guide them on how to recover and get a fresh start
3074208 if i was to describe mack in one word i would say that he is compassionate
3074209 he will go above and beyond it is who he is the results of the client to him are always above the financial reward
3074210 god has blessed me to always have a lot of things on my plate
3074211 when i have more on my plate i tend to be more efficient
3074212 it was sort of the low hanging fruit we got in 04 06
3074213 at some point theres a saturation and it gets harder and harder to get people to register to vote
3074214 i have extensive experience handling the same complicated business transactions that a circuit judge sees on a regular basis in circuit civil court family law court and probate court
3074215 any judge assigned to a division of the circuit court that he does not practice in will have to do some work lawyers are trained to learn study and research the type of law i practice is complicated criminal law is not so complicated its very procedural
3074216 immediately informs the parties how his courtroom will be conducted and so it is
3074217 ive been on the receiving end of decisions that have been made by our legislators as a professional and as someone who delivers services with public tax dollars
3074218 the state of florida is in a critical period the republican legislature is focused on pleasing big business
3074219 someone has to step up to the plate and be an advocate for the people
3074220 i have a track record for making positive change in the communities i serve
3074221 all i know is to serve the community its part of who i am
3074222 its a challenge for midsize cities to raise this kind of money for conventions like these
3074223 i think both the rnc and the dnc recognize they are going to have to find a way to do things a little differently in the future
3074224 has full confidence that he will be able to close the gap
3074225 by law the presidential candidates themselves cannot receive unlimited corporate contributions
3074226 but those who are fundraising for them can receive those contributions and apply it to the biggest advertisement of the presidential campaign the nominating convention
3074227 in economically deprived areas after school is when drug dealers convince the young boys to sell drugs or convince young girls to do favors for money
3074228 we try to have a place for kids to come so we can keep them safe until their parents come home
3074229 this is not the 1950s you cant leave a 10 year old alone in the house
3074230 we feel our first responsibility is to serve birth to 5 because that is what we are mandated to do and paid to do
3074231 we can hardly keep our head above water as it is
3074232 avoid the times when there have been really rancorous debates in the confirmation process
3074233 for a guy whos 52 years old i guess thats a nice problem to have ill take it
3074234 the price is obviously a strong draw for somebody whos frugal
3074235 many of floridas top officials who understand the importance of natural marriage to children families and society
3074236 the best choice on the merits former florida gov jeb bush has the wrong last name
3074237 of too frequent political opportunism that would disappoint much of the party
3074238 youre putting something in there before youve decided what youre going to do with the everglades
3074239 what were trying to achieve here is really to create a balance between economic development our sugar operation and the environment
3074240 when development proposals come before you have the science developed you end up with development limiting options for restoration
3074241 you have 1 700 people here who are waiting for some kind any kind of answer
3074242 and if you can give them a job future then i think you should start now
3074243 we need to work on the inland port issue and we need to work on it quickly
3074244 the opportunity we have for economic growth here is incredible
3074245 i known the inland port is very important to the glades im just not sure this is the right spot
3074246 with all that property out there there has to be some place where they can do this and not still be in this footprint
3074247 theres no more important voter in this media market than the hispanic swing vote
3074248 i think people like me feel proud of being in a thinking process rather than just going with one party
3074249 people are afraid to take on any greater financial responsibility right now
3074250 any way you cut it whether its one home or 1 000 homes were better off with portability
3074251 i bet i answer two dozen portability questions a day theyre thinking about it but they want to know how much further do i think home prices will drop and when will it end
3074252 of anybody that is the one company you would think would be the least likely to go out of business it was a huge surprise to all of us
3074253 certainly it has made making a living in sugar much more difficult over the last few years
3074254 there are almost 40 different free trade agreements currently lined up like airplanes on the runway
3074255 in the face of a global food price crisis we simply could not agree to a result that would raise more barriers to world food trade
3074256 we believe the government will no longer bring in too much sugar
3074257 what happens when you have these families just like anheuser busch when you get farther down the line and go to the second and third generation you have more heirs
3074258 they dont care about the company they care about the money they want to liquidate
3074259 the older people used to like to come down and see the cane harvest and see the whole agricultural thing occurring the new people dont give a flip they just want to make some money
3074260 it shows that all the people who sold shares in the past were truly getting shortchanged
3074261 they have been a fabulous partner in agribusiness they are forward thinking and solid business people after the next six years it will be a great loss to the agribusiness community
3074262 these have been difficult times in the last three years for sugar the price has been in the toilet
3074263 the biggest problem with sugar is it is a commodity regulated by the u s government
3074264 one of the first things discussed was whether this would have a long term reach and effect on pricing
3074265 they kept it very close to the vest we had no inkling
3074266 when we see a player go out of business we are never happy about that our first thoughts go to the towns and the people and the lives it affects in that area
3074267 u s sugar is an old fine company that you hate to see go down for the sake of clewiston and the other towns
3074268 im lost and very tired might you have a place where i can sleep for the night im very compact so i wont take up much room
3074269 as long as you dont mind sleeping in my 19 year old daughters room
3074270 hope you got a good nights sleep last night good thing my daughters away at college or you wouldnt have been able to sleep in her room
3074271 it wouldnt have mattered as an inanimate object im not capable of feeling carnal desires anyway
3074272 yeah i guess thats true say are you usb 2 0 compatible
3074273 the amount of gesso applied determines the texture of your painting surface
3074274 if a painter is going to be working in detail a smoother surface may be better
3074275 the polymer can only be broken down so much and adding water compromises the integrity of the gesso film
3074276 sheffields sepia toned pictures of a deserted jail had a commanding presence thanks to their giant size and the exquisite detail revealing every chip of paint and rust in three images the artist inserted himself as a shadowy figure moving through the gloomy setting charles street jail 1 was triumphant both beckoning and repulsive to see and imagine

3074281 i think legal writing belongs to that large undifferentiated unglamorous category of writing known as nonfiction prose someone who is a good legal writer would but for the need to master a different substantive subject be an equivalently good writer of history economics or indeed theology
3074282 the us should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course
3074283 georgia has implemented far reaching political economic and military reforms
3074284 both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside its chauvinism was beyond all bounds
3074285 the reason lado did this is because he knew the enormous pr value that georgia would gain by going to the money people and analysts particularly since georgia is clearly the aggressor this time
3074286 lado is a former banker himself so he knew that by framing the conflict for the most influential bankers and analysts in new york that these power bankers would then write up reports and go on cnbc and argue lado gurgenidzes talking points it was brilliant and now youre starting to see the american media shift its coverage from calling it georgia invading ossetian territory to the new spin that its russian imperial aggression against tiny little georgia

3074290 i read your article on rita odom this past week and wondered if any kind of fund had been set up to try and help her and her boys my husband was also in iraq and needless to say no one comes back unchanged our hearts went out to this family who has gone through so much please let us know if there is anything we can do to help
3074291 i read your story of rita odom and i was sadden with the out come of brians actions toward rita i feel that the doctors who prescribed these antidepressants drugs are just as criminally responsible as the drug manufactures are in what happen with brians state of mind it is a drug that alters the brain and does not fix what is actually the problem i hope brian gets the help he needs and deserves
3074292 reading ritas story in todays sunday paper really sheds light on what out returning veterans must deal with the rest of their lives
3074293 we cant say whether or not the shark took a swimming young bear or ate a carcase
3074294 we dont know how active these sharks are as predators
3074295 theres no possibility a greenland shark could predate a live adult white bear unless it was injured or seriously ill

3074301 la pol tica industrial la pol tica tur stica o a las de empleo
3074302 todo esto sin contar con el gran l o que ha organizado el consell con las ayudas agrarias y la inexistente pol tica de salvaguarda de un sector sobre el que se ha consolidado hist ricamente la econom a valenciana y que al menos por gratitud hacia su sacrificio y aportaci n debiera hacer un esfuerzo en mantener a flote
3074303 s lo piensan en pol ticas macroecon micas que no son de su competencia

3074307 amplio campo de pol ticas que puede desarrollar el consell aunque intenten olvidarlo
3074308 lamentablemente la tentaci n de las pol ticas monetarias es tan fuerte que s lo han pensado en lo imposible es decir en inyectar liquidez al sistema
3074309 toda la liquidez se ha ido a acaparar opciones de futuro de petr leo y alimentos

3074358 veterinarians shelters and animal rescue groups have requested a scanner capable of reading several brands and types of microchips used in pets and horses in the united states
3074359 unfortunately the users very legitimate request is analogous to having a radio play two different stations at the same time possible but technically difficult and expensive historically readers capable of multi mode functionality were burdened with a severe performance penalty avids recent technological breakthroughs have resolved this problem
3074360 the design criteria for the minitracker pro was based on the usda report on regulation of pet microchipping and recommendations from the coalition for reuniting pets and families
3074361 the coalition asked for scanners to read all 125 khz and 134 2 khz microchips whether encrypted or unencrypted
3074362 we also included as a design criteria that these new scanners would be effective and dependable

3074366 children are notoriously picky eaters but they enjoy many processed meats and derive essential vitamins minerals protein and amino acids to the diet
3074367 uneaten bowls of lentil artichoke stew or potato cauliflower curry two of pcrms suggested recipes contribute nothing to a childs diet

3074404 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

3074432 our main goal with this new site is to use its original content to help us climb back to the top in search engine ranking
3074433 in order to attract more traffic to sextoy com we decided to focus on unique content from three blogs
3074434 we have gone from the top of the search engines to the bottom back to the top and down again
3074435 there are so many funny pictures and videos related to sex toys out on the internet
3074436 we thought this would be a good place to aggregate all that content
3074437 hentai has always been popular on pornotube and to have an entire channel devoted to some of the best content out there is wonderful
3074438 visitors will be thrilled to have hentaikeys content available on the site
3074439 evotum basically is a video streaming provider with dvd quality
3074440 it allows studios that own their own content to offer it in their own video on demand theaters instead of going through third party applications it gives them the opportunity to take charge of their content while offering customers an experience that is easy and beautiful it takes the online experience to the next level because its almost like watching regular tv its a seamless application with no buffering and it goes through all firewalls people can watch it anywhere at any time all you need is a pc or a mac and an internet connection its the only platform i know of that works on both a pc and mac the system is perfect for adult because it leaves no footprint
3074441 ive seen the video surge the laser disc experiment and i was one of the first people in dvd distribution so ive seen a lot of trends
3074442 its the cutting edge i know its really hard for the old brick and mortar people to understand the internet but theyre really hurting their companies by not getting ready for this next generation of content delivery my job is to go from studio to studio and educate them with the hope that theyll understand how evotum works and why they need to buy into it
3074443 say a guy is online and he doesnt want his wife to know hes watching a porn movie
3074444 he simply has to close it and if she goes back to look at the browser theres no record he ever was there it doesnt even show up on the hard drive
3074445 the system allows companies with content to eliminate the third party vod providers
3074446 evotum allows them to offer their content directly to the customer
3074447 the big vod businesses can offer traffic of course but its time for the old brick and mortar people to understand the dynamics of the internet and start building their own traffic to increase their profits they need to keep in mind also that hotmovies and aebn dont have a drm in place
3074448 the money it takes to have your own evotum platform is pennies in the big picture
3074449 to buy the evotum platform costs roughly about the same as a good web design
3074450 many content providers have the money but wont spend it on this system its a matter of teaching an old dog new tricks in the past big content houses only wrote checks for production now they have to write checks for new delivery methods and theyre apprehensive because they want immediate results they say their dvd sales are still good in certain niches and i believe them but i think theyre selling to an older generation and missing out on the 18 to 25 year old customers who are much more internet savvy they want better viewing experiences and the evotum experience is so brilliant its like having that dvd in your library
3074451 we will offer content houses a free trial to see how their content will look on our platform
3074452 they only need to contact me and we will encode their content and give them free demonstrations we guarantee that their content will look better on our platform
3074453 we feel that bicycles are an important tool in the development of strong economies in developing nations and world bicycle relief is doing a great job of putting them into the right hands with the right support
3074454 we are doing what we can to help them in their work
3074455 a bicycle multiplies a persons productivity when you compare it to walking
3074456 we appreciate that kinetic koffee is lending its support to our efforts knowing that each bicycle we can provide will make a difference in a persons life
3074457 its a huge compliment to be asked to do that and it was really amazing to be taken seriously

3074499 al khatam itu ada dua allah menutup kewalian mutlak dan allah menutup kewalian muhammadiyah penutup kewalian mutlak adalah nabi isa alaihissalaam dia adalah wali dengan nubuwwah mutlak yang kelak turun di era ummat ini dimana turunnya di akhir zaman sebagai pewaris dan penutup dimana tidak ada wali dengan nubuwwah mutlak setelah itu ia disela oleh nubuwwah syariat dan nubuwwah risalah sebagaimana nabi muhammad saw sebagai penutup kenabian dimana tidak ada lagi kenabian syariat setelah itu walau pun setelah itu masih turun seperti nabi isa sebagai salah satu dari ulul azmi dari para rasul dan nabi mulia maka turunnya nabi isa sebagai wali dengan nubuwwah mutlaknya tetapi aturannya mengikuti aturan nabi muhammad saw bergabung dengan para wali dari ummat nabi muhammad lainnya ia termasuk golongan kita dan pemuka kita pada mulanya ada nabi yaitu adam as dan akhirnya juga ada nabi yaitu nabi isa sebagai nabi ikhtishah kekhususan sehingga nabi isa kekal di hari mahsyar ikut terhampar dalam dua hamparan mahsyar satu mahsyar bersama kita dan satu mahsyar bersama para rasul dan para nabi adapun penutup kewalian muhammadiyah saat ini zaman muhyiddin ibnu arabi ada pada seorang dari bangsa arab yang memiliki kemuliaan sejati saya kenal di tahun 595 h saya melihat tanda rahasia yang diperlihatkan oleh allah taala pada saya dari kenyataan ubudiyahnya dan saya lihat itu di kota fes sehingga saya melihatnya sebagai penutup kewalian muhammadiyah darinya dan allah telah mengujinya dengan keingkaran berbagai kalangan padanya mengenai hakikat allah dalam sirr nya sebagaimana allah menutup nubuwwah syariat dengan nabi muhammad saw begitu juga allah menutup kewalian muhammadi yang berhasil mewarisi al muhammadiyah bukan diwarisi dari para nabi sebab para wali itu ada yang mewarisi ibrahim musa dan nabi isa maka mereka itu masih kita dapatkan setelah munculnya khatamul auliya muhammadi dan setelah itu tidak ada lagi wali pada kalbu muhammad saw inilah arti dari khatamul wilayah al muhammadiyah sedangkan khatamul wilayah umum dimana tidak ada lagi wali setelah itu ada pada nabi isa alaissalam dan kami menemukan sejumlah kalangan sebagai wali pada kalbu nabi isa as dan sejumlah wali yang berada dalam kalbu para rasul lainnya

3074690 one thing we can definitely rule out is reversing our fixtures with georgia as croke park would not be available
3074691 are you people nuts pay compensations serve time wth is wrong with you people if a man wants to make fake pictures
3074692 marykate and ashley your really great i love your outfits and hair i am your true fan love u lots bye

3074695 hes obviously recovering from some issues that hes had within the all black environment and hes just managing himself in conjunction with our medical staff
3074696 whether they all blacks management want us to potentially give him an opportunity to play at some point remains to be seen but hes part of our family and these boys are welcome at any time
3074697 following the match against argentina on saturday bakkies botha had a scan and he has ruptured his posterior cruciate ligament in his left knee
3074698 we will adopt a conservative management process which means bakkies will not undergo surgery but will rather complete a rehabilitation process
3074699 fourie had a head clash with the argentina wing a scan has shown he has a depressed fracture of his cheekbone and he will undergo surgery before the end of the week which means he will be out for six weeks post surgery
3074700 both players will be unavailable for the remainder of the tri nations and we hope that bakkies will be ready in time for the end of year tour to the uk
3074701 i think i was one of the few that did know the rules
3074702 i will bring it up to see whether people want to review it
3074703 i guess its something that needs to be looked at
3074704 this is the first time its come to bear since its been in this format
3074705 its certainly an ideal time to bring it up isnt it being the first time that its actually occurred
3074706 on reflection we need to go and do our homework but certainly on the sideline with about five minutes to go the officials on the sideline werent sure and we were preparing for extra time and they were suggesting it was going to be extra time as well
3074707 i think everyone would support it the fans the team both teams were left a little bit hollow straight after
3074708 the rugby union werent even prepared for it they didnt even have enough medals for the players so i think there was a little bit of uncertainty from within their own group and they werent ready for it
3074709 it was a pretty sour feeling for us actually after the game because the agreement had been made
3074710 its coming up about three months this weekend and ive had the clearance from the specialist to get back into it so that was basically my first run with the team
3074711 it was a complete break and i had a rod inserted through the canal in my bone and ive actually had the same one done in the other arm
3074712 it was quite a severe break huricanes wing hosea gear was running with the ball i went to tackle him and my forearm hit his knee hes a strong boy and bringing his knees up through sprinting there was a fair bit of force behind it and i was going in quite strongly with my arm too
3074713 it was two forces colliding so someone had to come off second best and the radius isnt that big a bone
3074714 but thats just rugby it comes with its ups and it comes with its downs and its about how you manage them at the end of the day im nearly back so the frustration has been and gone
3074715 im not a good watcher of rugby and ive tried to stay out of it as much as possible because i found myself getting frustrated
3074716 obviously i was around at the start of the campaign when we were doing our team building but once we got into the season leading up to the manawatu and otago games i pretty much kept clear and let the boys get on with their jobs
3074717 i cant really say if im able to get through training and tick all the right boxes then i could be anywhere from one to three weeks away but it all depends on how it the arm reacts to getting stuck in
3074718 i mean the wrist is still a bit weak i threw a ball about two weeks ago and it was quite painful so ive got to try and get back into that
3074719 wellington obviously have it right in terms of what theyre doing and ricki herbert has done a great job in his recruitment
3074720 i had been very critical of new zealands inclusion in the a league but i have got to honestly say my opinion has changed over the last year
3074721 theyve strengthened defensively and smeltzy is a very good player who i rate highly
3074722 what ricki did with them last year with such a limited pre season was fantastic the signings theyve made so far seem to be good and the psc was a good indication of that
3074723 theyve strengthened their team 10 fold really theyve shored up their defence and theyre actually very quick going forward we struggled to contain them at times in the pre season
3074724 this year theyll be looking more at the results and i think theyll be good
3074725 watching the yankees on the same field as the angels you get the feeling this might get worse before it gets better
3074726 this is a fresh beginning thats the way im looking at it
3074727 i think everything is behind me the broken leg the groin problem everything
3074728 marykate and ashley your really great i love your outfits and hair i am your true fan love u lots bye

3074737 ich wei ja nicht ob mich alle kennen es sitzen ja nicht nur leute aus dem sport am tisch
3074738 ich wei dass ich mehr machen muss um besser zu werden mein ziel ist es mich ganzheitlich zu entwickeln
3074739 ich sage mir das viele geld das ich verdiene ist ein ausgleich daf r
3074740 das interessiert mich nicht mehr seit doping dort das vorherrschende thema ist es scheint in diesem sport so verbreitet zu sein dass man das problem offenbar nicht mehr l sen kann
3074741 es hei t immer der nutzen sei im fu ball nicht so gro aber man kann sich auch in unserem sport dadurch einen vorteil verschaffen
3074742 ich habe schnell gemerkt dass fu ball nicht alles sein kann dass da mehr dahinterstecken muss
3074743 ich frage mich h tten wir nicht mehr machen k nnen
3074744 wir haben daraus gelernt damit es beim n chsten mal hoffentlich zum triumph reicht
3074745 die binde macht mich nicht zu einem besseren fu baller und ich muss noch besser werden in der ansprache an die mitspieler und in der kommunikation mit dem trainer
3074746 ich habe gesagt gibt es etwas sch neres als am letzten spieltag mit der schale aus m nchen zur ckzukehren
3074747 das ist im vergleich nur zweite wahl und wer gibt sich damit schon zufrieden

3074773 everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state everyone has the right to leave any country including his own and to return to his country

3074779 the attorney general appears to be ignoring both the magistrate and his own prosecutor therefore one has to assume the true motivation behind this action is to build campaign support for the next gubernatorial election and divert attention away from his own personal issues that may stand in the way of his ambitions
3074780 magistrate renee mcduffee ordered that the conditions of the bond included having no contact with the witnesses of this case the court was clear that this prohibition extended to the witnesses not merely the two victims
3074781 a violation of the terms and conditions set forth by the court on august 8 2008
3074782 take the battle to the enemy disrupt his plans and confront the worst threats before they emerge
3074783 adopt the principle that a social host owes a duty to a third party for injuries suffered by an intoxicated guest who was imbibing at his or her home
3074784 reasonable medical malpractice insurers shouldnt settle claims that are not strong
3074785 something unsettling when you learn your doctor was a hero at keg stands or a member of physicians looking for trophy wives in training
3074786 this failure rate has occurred within the first two years in the first year the x rays looked perfect we have revised four that did not have any radiolucent lines or migration and john moreland revised one these early cups fooled us but the symptoms were so classic for a loose implant that we operated the patients when we hit on the edge of the cup it would just pop free as time goes by the cups begin developing radiolucent lines we now have one cup at two years that has actually migrated a short distance it has tilted into varus we do not believe the fixation surface is good on these cups also there is a circular cutting surface on the periphery of the cup that we believe prevents the cup from fully seating we stopped using the cup after the first revisions
3074787 i think the judges are being paid off but i cant prove that
3074788 pm blowing a big raspberry at punch and judy politicians
3074789 sounds like the 16 9 flag did not get set on the disc there are
3074790 a world wide positive intention experiment will be conducted at 8 pm universal time 08 08 08 to put an end to secret agreements that have prevented the revolutionary technology and knowledge of extraterrestrial life entering mainstream society a galactic freedom day declaration has been issued by cooperating citizen organizations clearly expressing humanitys intent to put an end to secret agreements concerning extraterrestrial life
3074791 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
3074792 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
3074793 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
3074794 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
3074795 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
3074796 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
3074797 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
3074798 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
3074799 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
3074800 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
3074801 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
3074802 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
3074803 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
3074804 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
3074805 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
3074806 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
3074807 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
3074808 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
3074809 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
3074810 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
3074811 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
3074812 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
3074813 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
3074814 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
3074815 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
3074816 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
3074817 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
3074818 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
3074819 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
3074820 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
3074821 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
3074822 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
3074823 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
3074824 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
3074825 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
3074826 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
3074827 marykate and ashley your really great i love your outfits and hair i am your true fan love u lots bye
3074828 i guess if youre going to finish second and they tell you that you qualify for the ryder cup i think that youll take it
3074829 i believe confidence is important if a guy on a different tour won three times i might take him
3074830 the ryder cup should be on the back of their mind way back one shot at a time
3074831 since i was a young girl it has been my dream to become no 1 in the world
3074832 when you get older at least one day you can say you were no 1 and no one can take that away from you you are in the sony ericsson wta tour history books and its a great achievement
3074833 are you people nuts pay compensations serve time wth is wrong with you people if a man wants to make fake pictures

3074837 so theres no one who can improve on mourinhos record really it would have to go beyond mourinhos performance to really worry us and that will be a challenge with the players theyve got and the players theyve added
3074838 i believe we were very unlucky last season we lost the premier league by four points
3074839 we got 14 more points than the season before so this year we want to make another step forward challenge even more and win the title we feel there is no reason why with a young squad we should be less good this year than last year
3074840 clearly we have confidence in ourselves and have the quality to try to win every game but you never know what can happen in any competition
3074841 we started really well and finished really well last season if we can do the same this time then hopefully we will be better in the middle of the season
3074842 are you people nuts pay compensations serve time wth is wrong with you people if a man wants to make fake pictures
3074843 marykate and ashley your really great i love your outfits and hair i am your true fan love u lots bye

3074848 thats the saltiest thing ive ever had and i once ate a heaping bowl of salt
3074849 the american people expect congress to work toward solutions for their everyday problems
3074850 if you agree that congress should not be taking a five week vacation until we address the energy crisis will you join us in publicly calling on speaker pelosi to reconvene the house and allow a vote on increasing american made energy
3074851 i think its a disgrace that she is here on a book tour while there is no debate going on in congress
3074852 i spent many many saturday afternoons watching reruns of star trek and dreaming of its worlds leonard nimoy helped inspire my imagination of what mysteries the universe might in fact hold
3074853 id like to think that very same imagination is what fuels my desire and drive as a game designer pushing toward creating an mmo that is the ultimate star trek experience
3074854 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
3074855 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
3074856 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
3074857 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
3074858 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
3074859 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
3074860 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
3074861 i have an incredible amount of vintage that ive collected over the years
3074862 my style is very americana i gravitate to pieces that are american by nature either western or depression era
3074863 i do almost everything in jeans except sleep denim has become so high priced as of late my friends back home dont want to spend 250 for a pair of jeans i want them to be able to walk into a medium priced store and be able to afford a cool pair of jeans for less than 100 bucks dollars

3074867 instead of watching mindless tv for 16 hours a day its how to write a resume how to be a better parent how to avoid an std sexually transmitted disease and theres some network tv the news
3074868 they suck theyre loud and it keeps me up all day
3074869 i learned a lot more about prison and drugs than i ever needed to know
3074870 were getting a lot of young guys into the system
3074871 some of the first time felon programs theyre showing though theyre obsolete already
3074872 what happened to me and my family and my close relations resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics
3074873 these are my political enemies they dont care about the rule of law facts or internationally recognized due process
3074874 i receive information and hints about attempts to assassinate me all the time
3074875 the first cell formed in the precambrian ocean contained seventy seven minerals
3074876 hospitals are either eating the cost or passing it along to insurers so you and i are paying it in increased premiums
3074877 some companies seem to figure no one is watching so they can get away with it
3074878 drug companies say the price hikes cover the costs of keeping the drugs on the market

3074894 they make the decision who makes the team and who sits on the bench we hope they exercise that power to get this problem stopped
3074895 this is so much larger a problem than the general public is aware of
3074896 our first objective is raising awareness about how big of a problem it really is and not just continuing to deny that it is not going on in my school or district second is to educate parents coaches and teachers about how dangerous this drug really is
3074897 it is not typical of what we usually run into with the coaching community nationally
3074898 the kids sometimes dont like to hear it because its hard work to do it the right way and coaches are sometimes hesitant to deal with the steroid problem because that might be their starting quarterback or whatever hopefully we left them with the message that it can be a life or death issue
3074899 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3074900 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3074901 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3074902 said the initiative would give the city time to craft measures to lure sit down restaurants serving healthier food to a part of the city that desperately wants more of them
3074903 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3074904 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3074905 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3074906 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3074957 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister vladimir putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3074958 americans wishing to spend august vacationing with their families or watching the olympics may wonder why their newspapers and television screens are filled with images of war in the small country of georgia
3074959 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate cease fire
3074960 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
3074961 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for
3074962 this should be unacceptable to all the democratic countries of the world and should draw us together in universal condemnation of russian aggression
3074963 americans wishing to spend august vacationing with their families or watching the olympics may wonder why their newspapers and television screens are filled with images of war in the small country of georgia
3074964 following fraudulent parliamentary elections in 2003 a peaceful democratic revolution took place led by the u s educated lawyer
3074965 what the people of georgia have accomplished in terms of democratic governance a western orientation and domestic reform is nothing short of remarkable that makes
3074966 the implications of russian actions go beyond their threat to the territorial integrity and independence of a democratic georgia russia is using violence against georgia in part to intimidate other neighbors such as
3074967 yesterday georgia withdrew its troops from south ossetia and offered a ceasefire
3074968 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe it is time we moved forward with a number of steps
3074969 the united states and our allies should continue efforts to bring a resolution before the
3074970 the secretary of state should begin high level diplomacy including visiting europe to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia with the same aim the u s should coordinate with our partners in germany france and
3074971 any of the campaigns that would have tried to push that would have been burned by it
3074972 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3074973 a giant slug that speaks with a truman capote like southern drawl
3074974 roe vs wade is ultimately about saying that there is a realm of personal liberty for people to make this decision
3074975 but i dont think ultimately we ought to be criminalizing abortion
3074976 the percentage of infant deaths that were preterm related increased from 34 6 percent in 2000 to 36 5 percent in 2005
3074977 the choice of a pro abortion catholic for vice president would deal a major blow to any efforts by the obama campaign to reach out to catholic voters
3074978 both the bishops and the laity continue to wrestle with the scandal of prominent catholic politicians who support abortion and the choice of a pro abortion catholic running mate would amount to scratching at a deep and festering wound in the american catholic church
3074979 given his position ion everyone expects senator obama to select a pro abortion vice presidential candidate
3074980 but the choice of a catholic who publicly rejects the teachings of their faith on this foundational issue could be disastrous
3074981 in its last months in office the bush administration is proposing new rules that could discourage doctors and health care companies from providing birth control to women who need it
3074982 the regulation blurs the distinction between abortion and birth control and could even threaten good state laws that protect womens access to contraception
3074983 in an atmosphere that honors the olympic traditions of freedom and openness
3074984 chinas coercive population control program has imposed unspeakable violence pain and humiliation on hundreds of millions of chinese women many of whom suffer lifelong depression as a consequence
3074985 if you think you know how the catholic church in the united states wants its members to vote in the presidential election this year think again
3074986 single issue voting like simply choosing the anti abortion candidate is out
3074987 to understand that support for legal abortion is enough to disqualify a candidate from consideration for public office one doesnt need a bishops document or an argument about the nuances of catholic teaching
3074988 would we say to a candidate who supported terrorism i disagree with you on terrorism but whats your health care plan
3074989 i felt that the abortion was like being raped again
3074990 only this time it was much worse because i had consented to the assault
3074991 into the light rape abortion and the truth that set me free

3075006 people have always been interested in preserving existing buildings especially when the property has some type of significance in the community
3075007 more recently the conservational benefits of reusing older structures have become a major focus in short reuse is one of the best things you can do to preserve resources and building modernization also frequently allows the incorporation of energy efficient elements in addition depending on the level of the rehabilitation repairs can be far less costly than rebuilding
3075008 it was understood that we would preserve as much of the original fa ade as possible and that we would replace any pieces beyond salvation with closely color matched materials
3075009 by using a similar mortar color and joint size in repairing the brick facing we were able to create a seamless transition between what remained and what is new
3075010 the quality of new construction cannot match that of older structures
3075011 in the particular case of ps 34 it would have been cost prohibitive to recreate the brick and terra cotta detailing
3075012 while this is not a historic preservation project per se the neighborhood does have historic overtones
3075013 as such the hoboken historic district had input on the final design of the additions exterior we had to maintain certain aspects of the original fa ade and we were required to set the new portion of the building back from the street corner with the most prominent view of the property
3075014 a portion of this project is being funded by the state of new jersey under the green futures program
3075015 to qualify we had to meet certain energy star requirements on the new windows insulation and mechanical equipment
3075016 sometimes the historic significance of a structure both to its owner and its community can outweigh the more practical considerations of cost and efficiency
3075017 replacing the roof with red asphalt would be far less expensive and a lighter color material would adhere better to green standards
3075018 but theres little chance that such a departure from the original material would be allowed as it would degrade the integrity of this beautiful old building
3075019 part of the states criteria for awarding this type of funding is that the building plays a vital role within the life of its community
3075020 in this case westminster hall is an architecturally distinct element of this iconic campus its also open as a venue for local arts programs and public presentations preserving it in its original state is the logical choice

3075061 it is against peoples aspiration and the spirit of peoples movement ii this decision has created confusion whether the deposed king will vacate narayanhity or not
3075062 we expressed our serious concern over the missing crown and rare documents though ousted the king cannot leave the palace until he submits the crown and all important documents
3075063 the cabinet concluded to adjust pol prices the next meeting of the seven party alliance spa to be held on monday will take the final decision about price hike

3075108 but my brother was in a medical school and he didnt come home so my mother and grandfather went to search for him when they found him he was dead on the street

3075113 at certain stages they would send in the officers from england and i had to write down the name of the officer who was coming
3075114 when i heard his voice i just fell in love with his voice
3075115 he doesnt have a belfast accent but his tone of voice is so lovely thats how i fell in love and he must have felt the same
3075116 because we were different nationalities we had to wait for two years and we got married in 1963 in belfast
3075117 when i moved here there were no japanese but then when i went back to japan i couldnt answer my mother
3075118 she phoned all the neighbours and said nobuko is back from belfast but she doesnt know how to speak in japanese
3075119 i felt so ashamed but then a couple of days it all came back
3075120 i just said to myself why are they fighting each other if you had experienced the atom bomb you wouldnt fight you should love each other
3075121 i went back to see my school and so on but everything is so changed
3075122 when i was standing in the peace park it was so peaceful so nice but whenever i saw the museum i couldnt set foot in it because so many memories came flooding back
3075123 i dont hate the americans because it was wartime and in wartime you fight for your own country
3075124 the only thing i want to know is why did they drop the bomb only three days after they dropped the bomb on hiroshima

3075563 it did not really matter what we expected from life but rather what life expected from us we needed to stop asking about the meaning of life and instead to think of ourselves as those being questioned by life daily and hourly our answer must consist not in talk and meditation but in right action and in right conduct life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual
3075564 sensitive people who were used to a rich intellectual life may have suffered much pain they were often of a delicate constitution but the damage to their inner selves was less they were able to retreat from their terrible surroundings to a life of inner riches and spiritual freedom
3075565 i understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss be it only for a brief moment in the contemplation of his beloved in a position of utter desolation when man cannot express himself in positive action when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way an honorable way in such a position man can through loving contemplation of his beloved achieve fulfillment

3075588 one of the most often documented facts is that married people are healthier than non married people but the difference between married and unmarried people has changed over the past few decades
3075589 in general marriage tends to make people healthier happier and richer and thats especially true for men
3075590 an important potential reason is that never married men have greater access to social support now than they did in the past it used to be that having a spouse was important for social support and a social network
3075591 if you get married and then divorced that will hurt your health
3075592 this study provides confirmation that marriage does tend to make people healthier they didnt look at the quality of an individual marriage but that being married is more likely overall to make you happier than not being married

3075604 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3075605 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3075606 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3075607 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3075608 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3075609 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3075610 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3075611 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3075612 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3075613 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3075614 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3075615 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3075616 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3075617 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3075618 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3075619 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3075620 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3075621 this is one of the biggest problems they are too embarrassed to go and get help if they get the help sooner some of their savings might be saved and someone else might be saved from being exposed to a similar experience
3075622 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3075623 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3075624 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3075625 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3075626 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3075627 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3075628 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3075629 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3075630 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3075631 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3075632 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3075633 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3075634 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3075635 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3075636 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3075637 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3075638 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3075639 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3075640 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3075641 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3075642 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3075643 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

3075662 the prime minister expressed his hope that this visit will open a new page in the relations between the two countries and strengthen security and stability in iraq and the entire region
3075663 for the last twelve hours inhuman and indiscriminate aerial bombardments of the georgian territory continued the scale of devastating destruction and loss of innocent lives has yet to be assessed russian ground troops armed invasion transformed already in a full scale occupation of parts of georgian territory the process of extermination of georgian population
3075664 what is taking place now is not unexpected the russian federation as you recall on many occasions drew attention to the dangerous situation which was evolving around south ossetia the russian federation on many occasions drew attention to the fact that georgia was increasing at an increasing rate its offensive weapons georgia is the world record holder in the increase of its military budget which over recent years has grown by thirty times and now we understand what the purpose of all this was
3075665 definitely there has to be a very clear timeline timeline ok
3075666 what the bolivian people have expressed today is the consolidation of change were here to move forward with the recovery of our natural resources the consolidation of nationalization
3075667 yeah i actually i was dragged out by the police so you can see like ive been bleeding from like being dragged on the floor and then this is from the security guards this is from the security guards inside when they had this like cardboard that was like slicing my arm open in the beginning we hoped to actually go in and we hoped to hold up a tibetan flag and also this other banner you know in protest of the communist partys one party rule in china
3075668 we ask the united nations and the international society to push north korea pakistan and israel to denuclearize and hold strict measures against irans suspected nuclear weapons

3075671 heath wrote it all down so yeah i can see theres a lot of arkham and midnight in his joker
3075672 inflections maniacal throughout the film until fade into the background as he spews sincere borderline reasonable philosophy
3075673 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3075674 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3075675 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3075676 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3075677 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3075678 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3075679 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3075680 who are open to doing something on the production side
3075681 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3075682 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3075683 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3075684 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3075685 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3075686 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3075687 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3075688 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3075689 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3075690 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3075691 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3075692 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3075693 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3075694 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3075695 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3075696 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3075697 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3075698 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3075699 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3075700 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
3075701 one of your proposals is that unemployed drug users will have to accept treatment for their drug habit before receiving any benefit how will you know if somebody is a drug user or not
3075702 do you intend challenging gordon brown for the labour party leadership or do you hope to keep your seat in a 2010 general election tory landslide and then challenge for the leadership
3075703 instead of forcing people out to work couldnt something be done to bring work into our homes like with cottage industries
3075704 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3075705 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3075706 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3075707 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3075708 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3075709 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3075710 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3075711 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3075712 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3075713 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3075714 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3075715 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

3075722 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3075723 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3075724 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3075725 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3075726 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

3075734 two american activists from the new york based students for a free tibet unfurled the tibetan flag among the spectators at the equestrian stadium in hong kongs suburban sha tin district
3075735 we were silent while holding the flag and within about 15 seconds security was on us taking the flag down and moving us out of the stadium with a sheet draped over our heads as that was happening brianna and i calmly started speaking about what we were doing and why we were acting for tibet during the olympics the protest was nonviolent and the security that removed us were not abusive in any way we were escorted out of the stadium and informed that we had broken the house rules at the olympics by conducting a political demonstration we were expelled from the stadium but never detained by hk police and never arrested were now back in our hotel safe and sound

3075739 we were silent while holding the flag and within about 15 seconds security was on us taking the flag down and moving us out of the stadium with a sheet draped over our heads as that was happening brianna and i calmly started speaking about what we were doing and why we were acting for tibet during the olympics the protest was nonviolent and the security that removed us were not abusive in any way we were escorted out of the stadium and informed that we had broken the house rules at the olympics by conducting a political demonstration we were expelled from the stadium but never detained by hk police and never arrested were now back in our hotel safe and sound
3075740 colorados proposed amendment 48 the so called human life amendment a controversial mandate that seeks to confer constitutional rights to fertilized human eggs
3075741 you wont be surprised the their next door neighbor thinks the phelps set it themselves to scare her out claiming its a hate crime unfortunately i dont have any violins tiny enough maybe its a sign from god that god hates bigots
3075742 its not about getting through your storm its about learning to dance in the rain
3075743 i just heard the big bomb and we didnt know what hit us
3075744 we were all evacuated to the marketplace which was concrete so it was more secure
3075745 but my brother was in a medical school and he didnt come home so my mother and grandfather went to search for him when they found him he was dead on the street
3075746 we had to burn his body on the street because there were so many deaths
3075747 i can never forget the sight of so many people injured
3075748 i was so young then and afterwards when we were evacuated to my grandfathers native home we had to pass through where the bomb dropped and all we could see were the animals dead and the people coming back with their injured bodies
3075749 in those days ships would be billeted there and i was employed by texaco as a secretary
3075750 at certain stages they would send in the officers from england and i had to write down the name of the officer who was coming
3075751 when i heard his voice i just fell in love with his voice
3075752 he doesnt have a belfast accent but his tone of voice is so lovely thats how i fell in love and he must have felt the same
3075753 because we were different nationalities we had to wait for two years and we got married in 1963 in belfast
3075754 when i moved here there were no japanese but then when i went back to japan i couldnt answer my mother
3075755 she phoned all the neighbours and said nobuko is back from belfast but she doesnt know how to speak in japanese
3075756 i felt so ashamed but then a couple of days it all came back
3075757 i just said to myself why are they fighting each other if you had experienced the atom bomb you wouldnt fight you should love each other
3075758 i went back to see my school and so on but everything is so changed
3075759 when i was standing in the peace park it was so peaceful so nice but whenever i saw the museum i couldnt set foot in it because so many memories came flooding back
3075760 i dont hate the americans because it was wartime and in wartime you fight for your own country
3075761 the only thing i want to know is why did they drop the bomb only three days after they dropped the bomb on hiroshima
3075762 now lets understand weve gone through a bruising primary season between these two excellent candidates and there are some people still healing from that i understand it but in the end i believe that the hillary clinton supporters and hillary herself are definitely committed to obamas candidacy
3075763 im holding a fundraiser two fundraisers actually for her next week to retire her debt we as democrats have to come together so i dont believe a roll call would be helpful
3075764 important for us to be strong against senator mccain who will be a formidable opponent
3075765 there can be no unity until the voters who voted for clinton have their voices heard
3075766 everyone is free to vote their conscience for the only name on the ballot
3075767 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
3075768 bush stole the election well you know all politicians are crooks
3075769 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3075770 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3075771 trecy who knows there are no rules anymore its time to build
3075772 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
3075773 whats the point of trying working to change persevering etc theyre all corrupt the system is broken beyond repair blah blah blah
3075774 i have come to believe that obama is mean crafty and vindictive but not smart
3075775 i have come to believe that obama is mean crafty and vindictive but not smart
3075776 i can invade because i want to no other rationale considered
3075777 pressured by progressive activists who objected to the tepid language in a draft document prepared by the barack obama campaign the democratic platform writing committee reworked the partys official agenda saturday to include a clear commitment

3075895 my visit left me even more deeply convinced that we not only have a moral obligation to help displaced iraqi families but also a serious long term national security interest in ending this crisis
3075896 todays humanitarian crisis in iraq and the potential consequences for our national security are great can the united states afford to gamble that 4 million or more poor and displaced people in the heart of middle east wont explode in violent desperation sending the whole region into further disorder
3075897 what we cannot afford in my view is to squander the progress that has been made

3075900 numero a caso di teenager idioti che trovano la morte nei peggiori modi possibili
3075901 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3075902 un viaggio in cui abbiamo seguito la quotidianit obiettivamente differente rispetto alla nostra di due ragazzi per ogni nazione abbiamo raccolto speranza gioia e voglia di uscirne fino a dieci anni la speranza fortissima poi la coscienza delle difficolt diventa senzaltro pi marcata
3075903 un grosso lavoro preliminare che abbiamo fatto con linter e poi il compito stato nostro a volte stato difficile concretizzare un approccio con la telecamera da parte di bambini che non sapevano neanche che cosa fosse
3075904 mi ha colpito il fatto che il calcio professionistico abbia perso quel qualcosa che invece il pallone e il campo hanno mantenuto nel mondo cio il potere aggregativo il potere del gruppo e della squadra che l rimane valido ogni bambino che abbiamo incontrato ha sognato di diventare un grande calciatore con inter campus il sogno si trasforma in qualcosa di concreto anche se in maniera diversa crescono persone che hanno la coscienza del gruppo e che tutti quanti si augurano diventino non dei bravi calciatori ma dei buoni padri di famiglia dei buoni professionisti insomma delle buone persone
3075905 i bambini non vanno a scuola e gli uomini vanno via dalle famiglie e le madri restano sole a crescerli li tengono in casa oppure li fanno giocare per la strada la nostra intuizione stata capire limportanza della maglia nerazzurra per un bambino noi donavamo una maglia e la possibilit di giocare in cambio chiedevamo che andassero a scuola e cos stato se mi fanno parlare di numeri e mi dicono che 10mila bambini sono tanti mi viene da rispondere che questa non e non sar mai una storia di numeri una storia di vita di tante vite diverse
3075906 credo che per una realt come quella di inter campus la crescita e lo sviluppo nei vari paesi sia un fattore da valutare con estrema attenzione una realt talmente seria che merita questo tipo di rispetto a volte in storie di questo genere si parte per istinto capisci che lo strumento del calcio potente e che ti consente di intervenire capisci che si pu fare vi faccio un altro esempio io ho avuto tramite linter dei rapporti molto semplici con il subcomandante marcos un persona di altissimo livello intellettuale noi abbiamo dato dei farmaci e dei generi di prima necessit per loro stato importante perch li faceva uscire da quella che era la loro realt e cos avviene anche per inter campus i bambini escono dalla loro realt e ne imparano unaltra la prima idea stata di iniziare a far qualcosa di utile oltre ovviamente a quel primario dovere che avevamo di vincere per i nostri tifosi
3075907 non deve essere stato facile realizzarlo senza cadere nel buonismo e nella retorica ma riuscendo a fare capire la nostra motivazione un film tuttaltro che triste sono storie che si fanno seguire una per una e che fanno capire una cosa i sentimenti dei bambini sono sempre gli stessi anche se avvengono in paesi e in situazioni completamente diverse una dallaltra

3075909 inevitabile che sorgano questo tipo di domande tenendo conto che nei luoghi in cui interagiamo si vivono realt di violenza ma noi non abbiamo mai paura abbiamo lavorato molte volte su richiesta delle stesse autorit governative ci capitato a cuba in libano e in palestina ormai siamo conosciuti e sanno come possiamo integrarci

3075986 i have to say barack obama has not had any of those experiences either nor has he ridden in a fighter plane and gotten shot down i mean
3075987 and john mccains my long time friend if that is one area that i would ask him to calm down on it s that dont be standing up and uttering your political views and implying that all the people in the military support them because they dont any more than when the democrats have political issues during the vietnam war lets get the politics out of the military take care of our military people or have our political arguments in other areas

3076001 we had two very good men and men of faith run for president in 2000 and 2004 but large segments of the electorate concluded that they did not really understand or relate to or frankly respect their ways of life
3076002 i believe that people dont cling to religion they value their faith you dont cling to guns you enjoy hunting or collecting or sport shooting i dont think he really gets it that people are looking for a president who stands up for you and not looks down on you

3076004 interviews with dozens of former classmates teachers neighbors and friends show that obama was not a regular practicing muslim when he was in indonesia
3076005 obama occasionally followed his stepfather to the mosque for friday prayers a few neighbors said

3076007 obama has never been a muslim and is a committed christian
3076008 we should not talk to them unless they recognize israel renounce violence and are willing to abide by previous accords
3076009 we like mr obama and we hope that he will win the election i do believe that mr obama is like john kennedy a great man with great principles he has a vision to change america to make it in a position to lead the world community but not with domination and arrogance
3076010 the ferry he will be riding is very important to that community its both a good and terrible symbol its good that it now exists but its terrible it took so long to build it
3076011 i propose that the federal government suspend all taxes on gasoline now paid by the american people from memorial day to labor day of this year the effect will be an immediate economic stimulus b ecause the cost of gas affects the price of food packaging and just about everything else these immediate steps will help to spread relief across the american economy
3076012 i think psychologically a lot of our problems today are psychological confidence trust uncertainty about our economic future ability to keep our own home a gas tax holiday might give em a little psychological boost lets have some straight talk its not a huge amount of money a little psychological boost thats what i think a gas tax holiday would help

3076118 the essence of all advice is that one should utilize ones full time twenty four hours a day as we did here at new vrindaban in nicely chanting and remembering the lords divine name transcendental form qualities and eternal pastimes thereby gradually engaging ones tongue and mind in this way one should reside in vraja goloka vrndavana dhama and serve krsna under the guidance of devotees one should follow in the footsteps of the lords beloved devotees who are deeply attached to his devotional service
3076119 i do not know how much nectar the name of krsna produces when the name of krsna appears on my tongue i wish to have many many many tongues when it enters my ears i desire millions of ears and when it enters my heart it conquers my consciousness
3076120 you are my husband you love me more than anyone
3076121 oh you want prasada go to yudhisthira hes in kamyavana he has nice prasada but go right at this time after draupadi has eaten
3076122 yes i will take a bath in yamuna with all my followers
3076123 what to do when he comes back we have nothing what can we prepare in a half hour
3076124 first im offending durvasa muni and his followers and now i have nothing to give krsna
3076125 now you go get durvasa muni and all of them but bring your club with you
3076126 well be just one minute you go home and well be there in a minute
3076127 if we go there after draupadi cooks this huge feast and we dont take anything bhima is going to kill us
3076128 you know what these people do you know why they are locking the doors we know during the day they go and search for beautiful young women then they seduce them into coming in then they lock the doors and give them intoxication so that they will submit to them and through very horrible tantric rites they are drinking wine enjoying sexual affairs with these women illicit sex this is what they do all night thats why they are all screaming
3076129 our lifes desire our goal we are hankering to be able to see lord caitanya dance nimai dance but because of these blasphemers we are not allowed to do that
3076130 no hard and fast rules in this chanting if you have karatals and mrdanga you play them if not you clap your hands with your family in your shop while you walk down the road just constantly chant the holy names of krsna whether you are sitting or you are laying down trying to sleep or whether you are eating or whether you are working just constantly fill your mouth with the holy name and you will be my life and soul
3076131 we are getting beaten we are getting tortured were afraid to chant
3076132 no no you go on chanting krsna will protect you
3076133 the qualifications that people consider opulences in this world are the greatest disqualifications to call out the holy name
3076134 tvam akincana gocara therefore the best things is to be totally impoverished
3076135 nityananda go and tell all the devotees and all the townspeople to come here today i will personally lead the nama sankirtana party today i will dance
3076136 today i will go to the kazis house not only chanting the holy name i will break that house down i will burn that house and let us see what he does to me today i am going to bring a great rainstorm of nama sankirtana and inundate the entire navadvipa with ecstatic love of god everyone come here this afternoon with a torch in your hand
3076137 we are chanting all day but why are we wasting the nights sleeping for the next year we should do kirtana twenty four hours

3076143 seeing brad with his kids hasnt been easy for her
3076144 its made her all the more determined to be a mum
3076145 she was this strong willed professional unattached woman and she was swooped upon by me
3076146 there were like 60 crewmen eating salami sandwiches and staring its really the least sexy thing you can ever imagine
3076147 utterly inane and innocuous in the most harmless uninteresting way the fruit of an overrated stars overblown ego recklessly indulged by studio excess

3076152 liam is really good the thing about liam is you havent heard the half of it if he could even be bothered to finish some of the songs he started honestly theyre amazing
3076153 but he suffers the curse of the gallaghers its like f ing hell cant finish it ive got demos of his at home with about 40 tunes which if he could be bothered would be amazing

3076155 sienna and balthazar met through friends and he was already separated from his wife when he released a statement in july saying he had split from his wife rosetta he had been sleeping on friends couches for six months
3076156 please sienna and he are in love theyre living together in los angeles everyone knows about her and accepts her
3076157 its just annoying that all this misinformation is out there
3076158 he could not care less about our kissing scene when we would ask him about it he was more interested in a new mark which had appeared on his hand and was worrying him
3076159 he even stopped shooting so he could go to the doctor and get it checked out we all had to wait around for him to come back
3076160 on his return i tried to discuss the scene with him again and he started complaining about the doctor who had said there was nothing wrong with him
3076161 i think she actually could see herself in the white house no not as president but first lady shed love nothing more
3076162 with barack obama his becoming president is them becoming president because michelle was there from the beginning without michelle he wouldnt be there michelle obama youre one hot mama
3076163 the offending took place more than 25 years ago and i have had 25 years successful teaching since then but in my eyes and i am sure in the eyes of society this makes no difference to the fact that i am a convicted sex offender

3076165 she has not provided that evidence and it is disappointing that she has chosen to breach the rules relating to dogs and behave in a confrontational manner toward staff
3076166 how dare they issue me a trespass order that lasts for two years while holding on to my fees i cant access any of the facilities ive paid to access
3076167 i feel sick to my stomach i believe the intention was to intimidate me and he has succeeded
3076168 it isnt against the law for someone to view a house but theres a reasonable expectation that the inspection is by someone who is interested in buying
3076169 my name is on the certificate of title which is given to all prospective buyers
3076170 from our perspective that was not unexpected but people have kind of assumed that if they lock themselves up in their houses that theyre protected theyre not
3076171 outside air pollution gets into houses relatively quickly and the levels that we detected were basically the same inside and out
3076172 every day they were measuring stuff for us it was a colossal piece of work
3076173 we even put some out a couple of months ago and are going to have a look in a few weeks but now there is no brood stock so even if the environmental conditions were right there are no adults to spawn
3076174 we dont know what is going to be happening it may be a write off altogether
3076175 its a real nuisance the urine has made its way into the machine and has affected it several times it then has to be cleaned up by somebody
3076176 its all fine to think this is bit of a laugh but quite frankly there is a toilet on the floor directly underneath the area hes done this hes just being disgusting
3076177 it was very cold at 5am and made it hard for the swimmers so we had to go to plan b which was to carry on swimming and forfeit the record attempt
3076178 i think ill make this one of my shorter training sessions
3076179 one of the arguments for the allowances is youre never not a public figure any more you are always a public figure once youve been prime minister and or governor general that carries with it certain responsibilities
3076180 it involves quite a lot of duties stuff you wouldnt be doing if you were just a private citizen
3076181 i dont know if im confident but were hopeful that we will and i understand weve narrowed it down to at least a smaller group of people
3076182 my dilemma is that i only have a vague image of who it was who was talking to me and id hate to pin it on the wrong person but you know if you see faces again they can revive memories so well just have to see
3076183 were just quietly and methodically working our way through it
3076184 gee the greens lost a lot when rod donald died
3076185 it was unedifying thats a fair description i shouldnt have responded like that but it was really a f ing terrible thing to do it was like using someones death for petty political gain
3076186 about the real difficulties of politics and the importance of personal relationships than in hours of honeyed words carefully workshopped through focus groups
3076187 i was probably careless whether he heard it or not
3076188 first and foremost it would be the honor of having laura remembered in such a noble cause
3076189 it was lurker himself who pointed out that each hotel receives a daily list of arriving elites with appropriate upgrade prioritization taking into account points balance spend and how the status was earned spend or promo within each tier
3076190 we know people are probably expecting a cheese fest and thats just not what we do
3076191 the truth is jeff and i write how we write
3076192 everythings got to come out of real emotion we want to deal with issues and show consequences but not the issue of the week and pound you over the head
3076193 they were able to develop such a loyal fan base
3076194 this has the glitz of an aaron spelling show but at the same time gabe and jeff have taken it and given it a sense of humour they really flip it on its ear sometimes
3076195 as long as it doesnt hit you over the head
3076196 i think its important to show what kids really use
3076197 here comes the german runner now leading by a length into the last lap although its worth bearing in mind that hes a rapist and he does goats
3076198 cotton candy back home is the right shade of pink
3076199 its got its own proper color cotton candy pink this stuff is more i dont know violet or magenta
3076200 uhh nothing i guess but also it sort of tasted like fish
3076201 just like everything else here sort of tastes like fish somehow
3076202 whaddaya want its an island nation ya know you are seriously harshing my sugar buzz here captain grumpybutt
3076203 cmon i took you out of the tower so you could get away for a little bit absorb some nightlife see the local color
3076204 i bet you never saw a twelve foot tall cross dressing demon doing karaoke before how many times were you gonna see that back in nebraska
3076205 you act like ive ever wanted to see something like that now i cant un see it hes still there singing copacabana every time i close my eyes
3076206 some people should be told that gold lam isnt for them
3076207 so why arent you at least trying to have a teensy bit of fun
3076208 i dont know i felt like maybe i was getting used to how weird this place is then you kidnap me and take me all the way out here and i totally lose my perspective again i dont think i could ever relax here i mean this is way too late for me to be up my sleep schedule is all weirded out and when i do sleep i keep having these dreams that im home but everythings different and nobody remembers my name ugh
3076209 and why are we out here in the first place didnt you tell me a while back that we were safe as long as we stayed in the tower
3076210 and you never told a little white lie in your life not once allright look we have a much better chance in the tower if something weird happens they got magical doodads and alarms and tubes and shit and were not so far from the tower that i couldnt get us there in a few minutes
3076211 but on the other hand hiding in a bunker and waiting for something terrible to happen is no way to live you gotta face your fears and thats what im doing out here with you
3076212 and anything that comes after you is gonna have to get through me first and im not exactly a pushover
3076213 you brought me out here to have a good time well im not so im going to start looking for something i want to do
3076214 so serious all of a sudden alright capn capn what is it you want to do
3076215 really are you sure that doesnt seem like your sort of thing
3076216 do you understand how dangerous it is for you to call me chicken huh do you cmon
3076217 you cant move me im like mount fuki or whatever that big mountain is called i am a mighty brick wall a giant statue one of those really big couches with a fold out bed inside it thats hard to pick up even with three people helping you i am vengeance i am the night i am darkwing du ooooff
3076218 thats all it was wont happen a second time twerp
3076219 it just so happens youre a natural at strapping on a suit that looks like a big fat dude and knocking people over they say everybodys good at something after all
3076220 so um as long as were out what else is there to do in this city
3076221 so what happened when you guys left the warehouse exactly
3076222 its well its hard to explain i guess real complicated you see that big building down that way looks like a big wedge of cheese with a notch in the middle
3076223 thats where we ended up miramoto headquarters it was a long hard fight but eventually we killed the bastard
3076224 complicated like i said all that matters is we won
3076225 the girl who did the trick with the purple goop turned out to be a traitor and very nearly ruined everything we had worked so hard for
3076226 see he didnt make it out of the big fight alive he died saving us and it took me a long long time to get over losing him in some ways i still havent
3076227 good eye kid yeah thats unagi hes always with me now
3076228 he was one of the greatest people ive ever known
3076229 and you promised not to lie to me im going to hold you to that
3076230 what did you do back in 2058 that made them need you a second time
3076231 for a while it used to be the only thing i was good at it still sort of is and there was a time when i was hurting people because i had no choice
3076232 there was somebody controlling me back then he took advantage of me made me do bad things and no matter how much ive already paid my debt in my heart i doubt ill ever break even
3076233 cherish the fact that youre getting it from somebody like me the truth doesnt normally fall easily from these lips
3076234 it was a long time ago and now if im gonna hurt somebody its because im trying to protect somebody else or myself im doing what i have to because my friends can rely on me and the weird thing is i kinda want them to
3076235 i think youre a good person i think youre trying to do the right thing even though you dont necessarily like who you are
3076236 you did bad things in your past and youre trying to make up for them i cant think of any good people ive ever known who hasnt done something they regret
3076237 you shouldnt torture yourself over things you cant change you know
3076238 since were sitting here being all truthful and crap i guess i have a confession to make just something you should probably know
3076239 i uh i want you to introduce me to the boy with the tail
3076240 the one with the weird verbal tic spooky ass sword skills has been living on a planet where shirts wont be invented for 500 more years that kid
3076241 ive seen him around i saw him talking to you guys a while back hes kinda cute
3076242 not my type but i guess im not a teenager anymore sure ill arrange a meet and greet or a press conference or whatever you want just dont run afoul of kennys mom shell punt you into next year if you so much as look at him cross eyed i know because she did it to me once by the time i got up and dusted myself off the monkeys had taken over the statue of liberty was half buried in the sand and moses was running around the place in a sackcloth speedo
3076243 nevermind just tread lightly is what im trying to say
3076244 i im not sorry that you fell into the portal with me and came here
3076245 dont get me wrong kid we get the ability to send you back and youre on the next bus out i hate that youre in danger here i hate worrying that something bad is going to happen to you at the same time though im sort of handling the worrying okay its like it feels like worrying about you is something that im supposed to do
3076246 i know right i spend a lot of time not worrying about anybody but myself and then you come along and i dont know i guess what im trying to say is having you here with me is keeping me from going completely bonkers in this city as much as i love it sometimes its just not home
3076247 i know what it sounds like but its true im sorry we cant get you back yet but im not sorry youre here
3076248 i suppose thats not the most horrible thing in the world
3076249 i guess you make this place bearable too im glad i have you to talk to and to show me around the city tonight
3076250 ta daaa now for my next trick hey peach watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat
3076251 oh well i sorta ummm im kinda magic in a way its hard to explain
3076252 i heal fast i get a few extra bonus stats here and there i can turn into a cute n fuzzy woodland creature and i age real slow
3076253 i turn into a fox she barely raises an eyebrow i tell her im secretly a baby boomer and that impresses her like i was saying kids these days by the way
3076254 you tell anybody back at hq about my age i tell the mom youve been digging through her underwear drawer she hates that
3076255 nope i do carry a sword though and i own queens greatest hits on 8 track the comparison stops there
3076256 i mean there has to be a downside what is it
3076257 the catch is if i stop having fun i die
3076258 why do you think i agreed to come back here so quickly its fun in a sick way i get to slice up zombies into coleslaw and shoot guns and drive a fast bike you do enough of that sort of thing you get to like it
3076259 and then theres naked booze time which doesnt happen nearly enough but i suppose too much of a good thing is too much and blah blah blah
3076260 i think my lack of sleep is catching up with me
3076261 here lay down on the smooth part of the floor and close your eyes for a while when youre feeling better well head back
3076262 okay but i wont be very comfortable i dont have a pillow
3076263 array of nantennas printed in gold and imaged with a scanning electron microscope the deposited wire is roughly a thousand atoms thick a flexible panel of interconnected nantennas may one day replace heavy expensive solar panels
3076264 inl researcher steven novack holds a plastic sheet of nanoantenna arrays created by embossing the antenna structure and depositing a conductive metal in the pattern each square contains roughly 260 million antennas nanotechnology r amp d usually occurs on the centimeter scale but this inl patented manufacturing process demonstrates nano scale features can be produced on a larger scale
3076265 processes have been developed to form nantennas onto polyethylene pe in a stamp and repeat process prototype nantenna electromagnetic collectors nec structures have been fabricated onto flexible substrates using this semi automated process we have produced a number of 4 inch square coupons that were tiled together to form sheet of nec structures
3076266 the nanoantennas are tiny gold squares or spirals set in a specially treated form of polyethylene a material used in plastic bags while others have successfully invented antennas that collect energy from lower frequency regions of the electromagnetic spectrum such as microwaves infrared rays have proven more elusive part of the reason is that materials properties change drastically at high frequency wavelengths kotter says
3076267 the researchers studied the behavior of various materials including gold manganese and copper under infrared rays and used the resulting data to build computer models of nanoantennas they found that with the right materials shape and size the simulated nanoantennas could harvest up to 92 percent of the energy at infrared wavelengths the team then created real life prototypes to test their computer models first they used conventional production methods to etch a silicon wafer with the nanoantenna pattern the silicon based nanoantennas matched the computer simulations absorbing more than 80 percent of the energy over the intended wavelength range
3076268 if these technical hurdles can be overcome nanoantennas have the potential to be a cheaper more efficient alternative to solar cells nanoantennas on the other hand can be tweaked to pick up specific wavelengths depending on their shape and size this flexibility would make it possible to create double sided nanoantenna sheets that harvest energy from different parts of the suns spectrum
3076269 solar cells gear up to go somewhere under the rainbow
3076270 researchers reported harvesting infrared photons with arrays of antennas akin to those on televisions and in cell phones a first step toward solar cells that convert heat to electricity
3076271 there is no satisfaction for the crime of singhs death
3076272 oh crud what did i say in all those pages
3076273 all you have to do is a single definition of what your data looks like in a very simple way and then we can expose that to the rest of the world through multiple formats

3076279 we needed a feature packed web filtering solution that was easy to manage and satisfied our price point and bandwidth concerns while protecting our students
3076280 st bernards iprism meets and exceeds these requirements it allows us to authenticate users run reports and gives staff members the freedom to adjust internet access at their discretion this greatly frees up time for our it department and keeps our district in line with cipa regulations
3076281 educational institutions such as poway usd need dependable web filtering solutions to protect their networks comply with federal regulations and efficiently manage bandwidth to ensure productivity
3076282 the iprism appliances are cost effective feature rich solutions that schools can rely on to block inappropriate online material and meet cipa compliance requirements
3076283 because they dont have instructions on the packet i hope thats not the case
3076284 regret does not even begin to describe my feelings about the relationship i feel terrible about what the school and his family have been through
3076285 at the time when i was dealing with a relationship breakup i became close to a group of students and entered into a sexual relationship with one of the students
3076286 the past seven months have been the worst in my life i felt so ashamed for what i did to my school and my departments also my family i really let everyone down i have felt i deserved everything coming to me
3076287 i love you i want to give you an abundant life but if one of my missionaries has not visited your obscure tribe then youll burn in literal flames for the rest of eternity
3076288 i love you and i have a wonderful plan for your life but if you dont believe in me then youll have to endure eternal conscious torment for well eternity of course

3076306 i have said some nice things about sen mccain before but i have to say something bad about him right now
3076307 formal public relations campaigns in politics and advertising which seek to create the impression of being spontaneous grassroots behavior the goal of such a campaign is to disguise the efforts of a political or commercial entity as an independent public reaction to some political entity a politician political group product service or event astroturfers attempt to orchestrate the actions of apparently diverse and geographically distributed individuals by both overt outreach awareness etc and covert disinformation means
3076308 disguising the efforts of a political entity as an independent and apparently diverse and geographically distributed public reaction
3076309 mccain is providing a rewards system for those interested in promoting his message whereas the obama campaign tries to get folks involved in spreading the message based on idealism sure none of the democratic social media campaigns explicitly incentivized their campaign messages but they encouraged users to go forth into the blogosphere and spread the word what is the mccain campaign really doing here
3076310 go to these blogs use these messages and dont bother telling anyone where the messages came from
3076311 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false

3076316 my name is greta and i do need some help i want to find silvia the fairy can you help me
3076317 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
3076318 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
3076319 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
3076320 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
3076321 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
3076322 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
3076323 it shows people are getting proficient at analysing apple software

3076564 our q2 sales came in below our initial projections primarily due to a weaker than expected demand in the u s for our core products we also experienced some softness in europe namely the u k which also impacted our top line performance while we have recently made progress in reducing costs at manufacturing and distribution platforms it was not enough to offset the lower than expected sales volumes for the quarter
3076565 the first six months of this year have been difficult as we dealt with a challenging retail enviroment unfavorable weather increased competition and a slowdown of sales for core styles in the u s that said there were also a number of positives in the quarter our international business continues to perform well we now sell in more than 100 countries with sales from outside the u s accounting for 58 of total sales in q2 sales in asia grew 69 australia and se asia pre books for q3 are particularly strong our business is also gaining momentum in south america
3076566 over the next two quarters we will be focused on right sizing our operations to better align with projected volume this will include reductions in worldwide headcount shutdown of canadian facility right sizing our distribution and infrastructure facilities and delaying certain capital expenditures we are also enacting a 25 cut in executive management salaries until the end of the year and foregoing executive bonuses for 2008
3076567 we will be implementing new initiatives aimed at broadening consumer awareness of our new products and strategically increasing our presence in the marketplace our plan is to focus on key accounts that have the resources and real estate to merchandise a larger assortment of crocs footwear beyond just a handful of styles therefore we do expect that our u s store count will come down by year end we expect to end the year with fourteen additional outlet stores and three additional fill price retail stores we plan to open additional stores in asia to take advantage of the momentum there

3076623 could ralph naders entrance and exit have helped al gore the impact of decoy dynamics on consumer choice
3076624 we found that the entrance and exit of a third option the nader effect can profoundly impact consumers preference
3076625 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favorite even if they werent before
3076626 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3076627 the increase in affinity that a product may receive when a decoy option real or not is removed can mark a significant change in consumer choice

3076632 there is a tiny cell component that is unique to germ cells the precursors to egg and sperm called nuage which means cloud in french other researchers recently suspected that nuage was involved in keeping genes from jumping around in germ cells of the female fruit fly
3076633 but until this mouse study no one knew for sure if it was involved in mammalian germ cells to test if the mouse nuage played a similar role in mammals we focused on a mouse protein called maelstrom whose distant relative protein in the fruit fly was implicated in the other study
3076634 we found that without the gene the process of meiosis was severely impaired
3076635 there was a profound defect in interactions of parental chromosomes a process known as synapsis leading to death of germ cells this was clear evidence that the protein is vital to the formation of sperm
3076636 we observed massive flooding of the cytoplasm and nuclei of germ cells by transposons in the mutant mice
3076637 this was the first time such a phenomenon was observed in germ cells of any species

3076770 explanation of what problems were identified and give the applicant a chance to respond to that
3076771 vendors need to name their products theres no question about that and theres unfortunately product specific taxonomy but broad terms like cloud computing those are canvasses that we should all be able to paint our piece of the mural on
3076772 the application was to protect the use of the term cloud computing as it relates specifically to our offering
3076773 at the time when we announced our solution it was not quite as pervasive a term we sought to protect our intellectual property and we certainly respect the intellectual property of other people and would not infringe on that of others

3076780 as the dwelling currently stands the council held very real concerns for the safety of the people living in the building
3076781 unfortunately the owner has not taken the opportunity to rectify the situation and we have had no choice but to act

3076799 but obviously it is interesting to know what is in it for them
3076800 teachers with 20 30 kids in the classroom dont get time to teach these things the job of a teacher is a very hard job when youve got 30 little brains thinking in different ways at different rates and on top of that you have an increasing amount of paperwork to do
3076801 i believe some teachers go into survival mode and just pass out information to the kids and often it doesnt meet the way individual students learn best
3076802 it used to be that new zealanders perceived after school tuition as something that asian countries did but now in places like australia private tuition is the norm particularly for those who can afford it

3076808 we were always going to struggle at knockhill using the standard engine so to come third in the first race and take the win and the top ten overall in the second race has to be seen as a fantastic result for the weekends work hopefully we can build on this and go on to add to the wins and podiums at cadwell park and improve our position in the cup standings
3076809 it was disappointing not to be able to make use of the extra power that the new superbike engine would have given us but the decision not to run it became a simple one to make after qualifying
3076810 before the problem arose it looked as if we may have been in a position to gain a third row start and maybe sneak into the top ten in qualifying

3076821 for almost a year we have been trying to talk to telecom about some of our ideas and concerns regarding the affairs of the company
3076822 in our view telecoms performance languishes behind that of other key telecommunications players in the international market and we believe this is partly due to an unclear and outdated strategy
3076823 they only have 3 and will need the support and clout of large shareholders to be successful if they cant get the support of institutions they have no show
3076824 we have met with elliott international a us hedge fund on several occasions over the last 12 months to discuss their views on telecoms strategic direction including the implications of structural separation
3076825 telecom has carefully considered the implications of structural separation and does not believe that separating our retail and network businesses would be in the best interest of shareholders at this time

3076840 some fronts may be followed by chilling southerly winds with hail and or sleet
3076841 since there was no significant broad scale influence on our weather patterns during the next few months it opened the possibility for more variability and variety
3076842 we do not expect any one particular pattern to dominate for any more than a week or two
3076843 occasional polar blasts that bring chilling winds from the southern ocean are also on the menu
3076844 we have been exploring numerous ways of avoiding this but unfortunately at the end of the day we have got to make a responsible decision we cant have deficits of that level because we would be going broke
3076845 in the absence of having the money to fund these we dont have a great deal of choice our only choice would be to take funding away from another community organisation and then you would be writing a different story
3076846 this is an allegation without any basis and i am concerned that it reflects badly on council
3076847 making one of the biggest decisions theyve ever had to make
3076848 there is no point in rehashing something from several months ago that simply is not true she ms butler simply has not done her homework

3076874 you know some women actually have orgasms as theyre giving birth my mom had one with me
3076875 i had been told to expect a dogging pain but was unprepared for the sensation of sexual ecstasy the voluptuous feeling of penetration crouched on my knees on the little afghan i caught the infant who rushed from my vagina into the small world between my legs in the midst of an extraordinary orgasm from the inside out
3076876 i feel the baby come down the sensation is ecstatic i had prepared somewhat for this being as painful as my last delivery had been yet this time the pulse of birth feels wonderful i am building up to the birth climax after nine months of pleasurable foreplay with one push the babe is in the canal the next push brings him down down into that space just before orgasm when we women know how god must have felt creating this planet he comes as do i
3076877 i had the most sought after midwife in france my competent and funny aunt marie therese whose radical idea it was that childbirth above all should feel sexy
3076878 many mothers experience a burning or splitting sensation as the largest diameter of the babys head passes through the birth outlet some actually experience orgasm
3076879 in 1968 i gave birth to robert kirkpatrick i was prepared conscious and in charge after 4 hours from the onset of labour i experienced an orgasm when my baby emerged from my body
3076880 ecstatic birth the conscious evolution of a possibility to a present reality
3076881 i happen to think that having babies is very sexy the actual birth is so sensuous very erotic the feelings weve both had at the birth of each of our babies were so primal
3076882 i started pushing while michael supported me as i squatted immediately after one vigorous push i felt damian coming down a tremendous excitement filled the kitchen and michael and i seemed to merge as our eyes met it was as if we had become one again as we did in a genital embrace yes we were one it was not just i who was having the baby michael was as well the moment had become ecstatic sensations of every kind and color coursed through me i was one one with everything and with that i shouted in sheer delight as i felt damian coming out he shot into the safety of michaels confident hands
3076883 biologically you are designed to receive great pleasure from your body not only during lovemaking and intercourse but in birth and breastfeeding too birth offers sexual pleasure on a continuum from pleasant sensations felt while your uterus rhythmically contracts in early labor if youre relaxed and feeling secure to an intense birth climax yes just like an orgasm as your baby slithers into the world of your waiting arms
3076884 giving birth is a highly creative act full of orgasmic feelings and can be a moment of ecstatic pleasure for the mother
3076885 pleasure in birth may be the starting point for optimal family relationships our knowledge of reproduction suggests there may be a biological reason for connecting pleasure in birth with the best outcome for the baby
3076886 pushing was absolutely incredible it felt so good i loved the sensation of my daughters head popping out and her body coming out was incredible i made roaring sounds kt later asked me if i was in a lot of pain and i said i felt no pain at all i was reaching down into the depths of my being i felt like i was reaching back through time eternal into the great mother herself and using my power to push her out the sounds were sounds of power and i felt awesomely empowered it was i could say the best feeling i have ever had primal force of life coursing through me power of woman power of birth power of carolyn if i can do that i can do anything i set my mind to the sensation of my daughters body sliding out of my vagina was orgasmic i still shudder when i think of how pleasurable that was
3076887 a woman in california was giving birth at home in a portable birth tub and feeling very sexy and loving with her partner each time she had a contraction she would cry out oh baby i love it more more her windows were open because it was july and soon a crowd gathered outside her home when the baby was born amidst shouts of yes yes oh my god yes her neighbors gave her a great round of applause they only realized that it was a birth after they heard the cries of a baby
3076888 it was the ultimate climax i felt open loose and free words cannot explain the feeling as my babys body slithered out to this day i can still sense that wonderful feeling inside it makes me tingle
3076889 yet in a strange way the energy flowing through the body in childbirth the pressure of contracting muscles the downward movement of the baby and the fanning open of soft tissues can be powerfully erotic childbirth can be the most intensely sexual feeling a woman ever experiences as strong as orgasm even more compelling than orgasm
3076890 birth is fundamentally a creative act as is the act of sexual union indeed many women have described giving birth as intensely pleasurable and have discussed it in orgasmic terms more and more women are enjoying labor and birth with their husbands just as they have enjoyed the sexual experience making love orgasm and giving birth are all inter connected
3076891 it was ecstatic wonderful thrilling i heard myself moaning in triumph not in pain there was no pain whatsoever only a primitive and sexual elation with the most spiraling fascinating thrill of all i felt my baby slither out i wanted to shout with joy
3076892 my first son was born by unexpected cesarian section my second was a planned homebirth with a midwife assisting he was posterior so it was all back labor and he wouldnt turn there was a great deal of pain but in the last few minutes as much pain as there was it suddenly swung the other way to huge waves of pleasure as his body came out an incredible rush like nothing i had ever felt before or since i said to my midwife dhyana wow what was that thing in the end she said that was the gift a lot of my ladies get that i held that baby and instantly loved him with my whole being maybe this is the way that nature had intended it to be for us now looking back the only thing i can think is that he went ramrod over my g spot all 9 pounds of him
3076893 i asked my husband to make love to me as i was in a very romantic mood and wanted to feel him inside me urgently it was a wonderful experience i had a few orgasms during contractions an absolutely delightful sensation there was no pain at all since then our lovemaking has gone from great to extraordinary
3076894 birth has much in common with orgasm the hormone oxytocin is released there are uterine contractions nipple erection and under the best circumstances for birth an orgasmic feeling
3076895 birth is a dark private and secret opening up of our ancient sexual selves birth sensations when we allow them to be are actually highly sensual much like the intense luscious squeezing contracting that happens during orgasms experienced in late pregnancy the sensations of giving birth are not fierce and violent they are rapturous we feel an ever increasing pressure on our cervix as our body prepares for the sweetest most intense of orgasms the lovely culmination of our labors of love birth during birth we pant scream and throw our head back this is sensuality with a purpose we are taking in extra oxygen releasing adrenaline into our bloodstream and widening our pelvic outlet and when the baby comes out all slick and new we are in ecstasy enraptured by the most heightened hormonal load we will ever know
3076896 at about 3 am i got a real feeling that the baby needed to be born and also a great surge of energy the first i had felt then i made a very astounding discovery i was able through prayer to get knowledge directly from god that birth is a sexual event and involves the same mechanisms that the beginnings involve i was able to get my labor started again and i was in hard labor within 15 minutes as long as i was alone and able to yield to the sexual joy of the birthing i was able to experience wonderful orgasmic feelings and no pain at all
3076897 my body told me to squat so i did i hunkered down on two feet concentrating knowing without being told that millions of females before me had brought their babies into the world in this ordained position it felt so deliciously comfortable to squat i felt the baby move down come come commmmme it was then i began to scream but not with pain with joy with release i felt an enormous all body orgasm as i bore down again and again and again crying out with lust and happiness the baby was coming and so was i i pushed an enormous last push with every fiber of my being the head and shoulders appeared by then i was sobbing i reached under the babys armpits and pulled out a child a living breathing infant born perfect perfectly beautiful my daughter
3076898 i returned upstairs with some of stellas dance tapes belly dancing to the music i found that the contractions were much more bearable oddly enough the more obscenely i thrust my pelvis back and forth the less it hurt i was amazed why hadnt i known that these movements were linked to the act of birthing i wondered moments later i discovered that all the pelvic thrusting i had been doing in my life dancing to get a date making love and now giving birth was integrally connected all that thrusting had gotten me pregnant and all this thrusting would help bring a new life into the world while the drums banged in my head i was serene knowing that i had found the secret to life the glorious pelvic thrust
3076899 birth is always intimate and sexual although the intimacy and the sexuality can be masked my own personal experience of the births of my children confirms this my feelings throughout my wifes labors i can describe only as those of a very close physical emotional sexual union with her and what i felt to be the transcendent force flowing through her the sensation was warm and soft like making love but was also strong forceful and awesome each time the experience changed my life and allowed me a glimpse of the transcendental
3076900 the two great values to be gained from social existence are knowledge and trade
3076901 but these very benefits indicate delimit and define what kind of men can be of value to one another and in what kind of society only rational productive independent men in a rational productive free society

3076911 het is jammer dat sommige van onze partners ons niet helpen en zelfs proberen ons te hinderen ik heb het in het bijzonder over de verplaatsing door de vs van het georgisch militair contingent uit irak naar de conflictzone
3076912 dit manoeuvre zal niets veranderen het is een stap terug van een oplossing voor de situatie
3076913 wat in zuid osseti gebeurt is een ware tragedie een menselijke tragedie een van de problemen in de huidige situatie is de koude oorlog mentaliteit die diep is geworteld in de geesten van amerikaanse diplomaten
3076914 de agressor in het conflict voor te stellen als het slachtoffer
3076915 niet het cynisme van dit beleid verrassend is want politiek is op zich een cynische zaak wel verrassend is de omvang van het cynisme de vakkundigheid om wit zwart te laten lijken en vice versa de vakkundigheid om agressors als slachtoffers voor te stellen en de verantwoordelijkheid voor de gevolgen te leggen bij de slachtoffers
3076916 saddam hoessein die enkele sjiitische dorpen uitmoordde is uiteindelijk voor zoiets opgehangen

3076926 there will be no restrictions on the press or on the movement of citizens this is a democratic country and we will not do those things
3076927 russia was hoping that saakashvili didnt have as much support as before they saw all the opposition rallies and demonstrations there have been in georgia over the last few months and russia thought that after all thats happened everyone would take a stand against saakashvili
3076928 what they didnt reckon with was that in this situation no one is going to come out against him on the contrary not even the opposition is criticising him thats for another time right now we have a war to defend the fatherland
3076929 now im not interested in that side of things the main thing is for russian soldiers to leave my country and for the war to end
3076930 could we ever have imagined wed live to see a war between russia and georgia

3076935 esto parece m s bien un intento por parte de la polic a y otras fuerzas de seguridad de espiar las conversaciones de los pasajeros
3076936 un mattino preso dal desiderio di fare una passeggiata lasciai il mio scrittoio e scesi in fretta le scale diretto in strada
3076937 una giovane cantante dove di preciso a una finestra a pianterreno
3076938 affacciata alla misera finestrella di periferia vidi una giovinetta in vesti chiare quasi ancora una scolara eppure gi alta e snella e cantava nellaria limpida in modo semplicemente delizioso
3076939 ogni passeggiata piena di incontri di cose che meritano desser viste sentite la conoscenza della natura e del paese si schiude ai sensi e agli sguardi dellattento passeggiatore che deve andare in giro ad occhi ben aperti
3076940 avanti con la passeggiata che cosa c di pi delizioso di pi semplice e bello dal tempo dei tempi che landare a piedi
3076941 situasi begini tentu saja butuh tindakan dan kekerasan untuk menanggulanginya
3076942 sebagaimana tukang emas menguji ke aslian emas dengan cara membakar mengetuk dengan palu menggosokkannya pada batu asah demikian pula periksalah dengan teliti semua ucapanku sebagaimana yang dilakukan oleh tukang emas janganlah engkau menerima semua ucapanku hanya atas dasar respek padaku
3076943 when this roundabout was constructed the aim was to have a flyover leading into felixstowe to ensure adequate access into and out of the town
3076944 while the suggestion of a third lane will improve the situation for people coming into the town more beyond that will be needed when we have significant new housing
3076945 we need that to be put into our core strategy so that developers and government will be aware of the situation
3076946 from the hour i ordain myself loosd of limits and
3076947 under glenn tiltons tenure united has gone from being the finest airline in the world with the best route structure and safety record to a shell of its former self
3076948 but its not about me its about my team and this program winning games
3076949 we took over a program that didnt make the big east tournament and were joining the best basketball league in america
3076950 we put ourselves in the position to be in the upper half i said this last year this team was good enough to be in the upper half of the league having grown up in north carolina and coached in the acc before i really believe that and thats the statement i will say about his years team i think this team is good enough to be in the top half of the league
3076951 hes really built this team into what it is today
3076952 thats how were going to think in order to stay humble and get where we need to be
3076953 thats how we started off so well last year we had a chip on our shoulder and we have to play that same way this year
3076954 we feel that a customer would want to buy products that cesar recommends since hes a specialist in his field
3076955 we sold our home may 2007 with the mortgage the property taxes utilities lawn care storage newspaper maid insurance hoa
3076956 fulltimers put togetherness to the test fulltime in a truck camper
3076957 we sold our home may 2007 with the mortgage the property taxes utilities lawn care storage newspaper maid insurance
3076958 the cctv images recovered clearly show the intent of the offenders who tried to force their way behind the counter of the post office
3076959 thankfully no one was injured however the type of weapons used and the level of force shown in the attempted robbery demonstrates how dangerous these individuals are
3076960 mainly are specialty players run a lot out of the shot gun but speed we are a fast team
3076961 last year he impressed me and this year even better
3076962 he eats and sleeps and think he would even eat a football if he could
3076963 there are a lot of young guys and for some this is their first year
3076964 for me models are just pieces of wood that i carve to make clothes look beautiful
3076965 there are thousands of models like all other models naomi campbell is the same way
3076966 networking is the essential skill for personal and career success
3076967 we havent announced anything for this type of cheap mini notebook and were still taking this wait and see attitude
3076968 the fact that there are a number of models coming out might give the indication that the market is growing and everybody wants to do this but whats interesting is you pull back the covers and talk to people in the industry and theyre kind of scared
3076969 if you cant grow the market with this form factor then what youre providing is a lower experience for less money which isnt good for the consumer and isnt good for the hardware maker and really isnt good for the channel as well
3076970 we believe the story line of ultra low cost notebooks will increasingly be sidelined as the notebook market continues to offer a better solution and experience at price points similar to what ultra low cost notebooks are hitting
3076971 you are dealing with something which most of us wouldnt use
3076972 the life and death of a german jewish christian nun by roderick strange for nun ministers in and around new orleans
3076973 she wrote the way she lived on the fly without retrospect always on the way climbing higher

3076977 as we looked through the comics there was this fascinating idea that
3076978 when youre dealing with questionable notions like people taking the law into their own hands you have to really ask where does that lead thats what makes the character so dark because he expresses a vengeful desire
3076979 if men define situations as real they are real in their consequences
3076980 the world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page
3076981 todays announcement marks another milestone in skyway softwares ongoing effort to simplify the software delivery process for our customers using skyway builder and our commitment to open standards and best of breed technologies
3076982 with the introduction of cloudfuzion axceleon continues its commitment to hide complexity for the artist brings complete workflow management to the 3d animation ecosystem and allows studios to harness developments in cloud computing realize savings on their infrastructure and increase productivity
3076983 cloudfuzion is revolutionary in its automated management of all aspects of the creative workflow process from launch through to final delivery on demand rendering capacity is a key part of seamless rendering and the evolved render farm and is a major deliverable of cloudfuzion
3076984 i thought we competed well despite having a disadvantage in size in most games the skill level of the players was incredible everyone here can play the game
3076985 although it is not true that all conservatives are stupid people it is true that most stupid people are conservative
3076986 stopping russia the us and its allies must unite against moscows war on georgia
3076987 this is a grave challenge to the united states and europe
3076988 the united states and its nato allies must together impose a price on russia
3076989 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3076990 may it be your strength though it be the last of mine
3076991 may it be your strength though it be the last of mine
3076992 we have information that a group of men from manchester were in the club at the time and may have spoken to damian gordon we would particularly like to speak to them
3076993 there were a lot of people in club icon when the shooting happened and i want them to come forward and speak to us
3076994 you may have information that you dont realise is important to this inquiry we want to speak to everyone who was at club icon that night we are in the middle of tracing those who were at the club using cctv from the area but it would easier if you could come to us
3076995 i understand that you may be scared to come forward if you saw or know something about what happened to damian but remember this was a young man with a wife and child and his life ahead of him
3076996 damians death has destroyed his family and those responsible need to be stopped and brought to justice there is new legislation in place protecting the anonymity of witnesses this is something we intend to fully investigate for anyone coming forward with information about this crime
3076997 finally i would also appeal to a woman who called us anonymously who we believe to be from the manchester area to contact us again
3076998 the information she provided is very specific and vital and we need to speak to her further any information could be crucial and will be treated in the strictest confidence
3076999 until now i cannot recall telling my kumpadre vice governor pi ol that i and particularly the military will not help north cotabato in case armed conflict arise as a result of them not helping the peace process
3077000 and since they are asking ammunitions i suspect there are firearms already and i so i asked on whether they are licensed or not
3077001 it is unfortunate that some local government units have declared me and some of my colleagues at the grp panel persona non grata nevertheless my love for mindanao where i spent majority of the time in my career never blemished
3077002 we think people take political information from all sorts of sources in their daily life
3077003 and for some people oprah is clearly one of them
3077004 russland ist in diesem konflikt mit abstand die st rkste partei und russland ist auch nicht bereit sich jetzt formal wenigstens auf einen waffenstillstand einzulassen ministerpr sident putin spricht davon dass die milit raktion zu ihrem logischen ende gef hrt werden soll was immer das auch bedeutet deswegen geht mein appell an alle beteiligten insbesondere aber an russland zu einem sofortigen waffenstillstand zu kommen
3077005 die u erung des russischen ministerpr sident putin deutet darauf hin dass er einen sofortigen waffenstillstand ablehnt und die kriegsziele russlands durchsetzen will was das hei t k nnen wir so genau nicht sagen weil russland sich dazu noch nicht ge u ert hat
3077006 obwohl das eigentlich die dom ne des pr sidenten ist
3077007 aber wenn wir berhaupt einfluss nehmen wollen dann m ssen wir geschlossen auftreten und mit einer stimme sprechen und das tun der franz sische pr sident sarkozy die deutsche bundeskanzlerin und der deutsche au enminister zusammen mit dem franz sischen und dem finnischen au enminister

3077010 obviously the money is fungible but our services are not im talking about branding the service we provide not the actual dollars
3077011 while the figures for july are disappointing one should not read too much into an over sized drop in multiple starts in a single month
3077012 this month to month volatility in this market segment is remarkably high on both the upside and downside
3077013 the trend in single starts is usually more telling and it remains consistent with our theme for this sector of the canadian economy which is that it should experience a cooling after running too hot for too long
3077014 a greater number of existing homes for sale and the continued long term shift to smaller and relatively cheaper multiple family units will continue to put downward pressure on single family starts over the next 12 18 months
3077015 but it was badly broken up after smashing through the forest canopy to the ground
3077016 the two who arrived by helicopter are in a stable condition and have fractures to their legs
3077017 saya punya bukti bukti semuanya sebagai istri yang baik perasaan saya sakit sekali apalagi ruhut juga sering membawa diana ke acara bersama teman temannya tanpa rasa malu
3077018 jelas ini bahaya karena selain selebritis ruhut juga seorang politisi tentunya ia harus mewaspadai lawan politiknya
3077019 saya pernah memanggil diana dan bertmu pada 15 juli tahun lalu kepada saya dia mengaku bekerja sebagai ibu rumah tangga dan masih punya suami serta anak dua ia juga berjanji tidak akan mengganggu rumah tangga kami
3077020 bukannya menjauhi ruhut malah semakin dekat dan sering jalan jalan keluar kota dan luar negeri
3077021 diana sudah menjadi bagian dari ruhut dan ini menghancurkan bahtera rumah tangga kami bayangkan ruhut sudah tidak pulang satu bulan lebih saya minta dia bertanggung jawab sebagai suami
3077022 the returns are pretty much reflective of the volatility in international markets if we hadnt had such a conservative approach it would have been much worse
3077023 weve got quite a lot invested in cash and fixed interest those were dragged down by equity investments which were a bit of a disaster across the board
3077024 the combination of extinctions global species migrations and the widespread replacement of natural vegetation with agricultural monocultures is producing a distinctive contemporary biostratigraphic signal these effects are permanent as future evolution will take place from surviving and frequently anthropogenically relocated stocks

3077029 this increased melt rate descent is largely due to warming up thanks to the emission of green house gases but increased human interference is also not a good sign for the glaciers health earlier there were nine tributaries to the gangotri glacier now we are left with five
3077030 i kept telling the chief paul walters santa ana maybe we should get you some implants or a water bra
3077031 ive met with him on more than one occasion to discuss the whole sheriff hutchens situation and management issues in general
3077032 as respects to the comments that were reported were all disgusted
3077033 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia
3077034 nel futuro non intendo pi rispondere ad attacchi del genere che mi comportano solo uninutile perdita di tempo che intendo impiegare nellattivit parlamentare e nella cura della mia circoscrizione elettorale centro e nord america dove devo organizzare lapertura di associazioni del popolo della libert

3077038 despite the tense situation between georgia and russia we continue to send oil through georgia via the baku supsa pipeline and by rail to the batumi oil terminal
3077039 concern over contracting demand the result of a slowing global economy has motivated sellers
3077040 in yesterdays most recent tank attack the advancing tanks were supposedly crewed by ukrainians two unidentified bodies found today are said to be black possibly they are americans but we cant say for sure yet
3077041 there are lots of bodies over there a lot of people have been killed mostly ossetians but also georgians they had american emblems on their forearms and they were in black uniforms
3077042 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3077043 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
3077044 i just wanted to let all of you know that me and wwe have parted ways i will update you in the near future

3077051 julia was trying to get out of the way of the picture she wasnt being sarcastic
3077052 the proposal of high price increases and more water meters combined with the rising cost of energy bills could hurt many households london has some of the countrys poorest areas and the government needs to seriously consider ways to help those who cannot afford to pay for their water

3077055 our study showed that functions can be maintained in older animals so long as damaged proteins continue to be efficiently removed strongly supporting the idea that protein buildup in cells plays an important role in aging itself
3077056 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older
3077057 i did feel for a long period that there wasnt anything new to buy
3077058 but i really like the slim fit its not so roomy not so bulky and its a lot cleaner
3077059 this is a trend that you have to buy otherwise you look outdated
3077060 womens wear has painted themselves in a corner by offering too many options and with everything a trend it is very easy not to buy anything
3077061 if you are keeping up with fashion people notice and it gives them more confidence
3077062 i had looked in the mirror and never was impressed i looked like a little kid who was waiting to grow into his clothes

3077070 seven time tour de france winner lance armstrong has finished second in his first race since 2005
3077071 not since his last victory ride down the champs elysees in 2005 has a finish line looked so sensational to lance armstrong
3077072 the seven time tour de france champion took second place in the leadville trail 100 on saturday pushing six time defending champion dave wiens to a record time in the
3077073 the guy i raced today isnt the same guy that won the tours

3077075 if god is to be praised for all good things then he must also be held responsible for the bad
3077076 if he chooses not to help during tragedies like 9 11 what makes you think hes stepping in to assist with global warming
3077077 it is written that god knows all and sees all he gave us free will knowing we would stray from him therefor he is directly responsible for the sin of man and should hold himself to account for it
3077078 anyone who blindly devotes themselves to any religion and follows without question the word of god or man is doing a disservice to the free will he or she was given
3077079 if god did not intercede when his own son was tortured and killed why should any other person hope or pray for his help
3077080 if we truly believe that the world was created and belongs to god then his neglect is criminal god is an absentee landlord and we are his suffering tenants

3077091 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3077092 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3077093 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3077094 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences
3077095 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3077096 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection

3077105 the long list of people who have offered their assistance kind words and prayers to us has been incredible

3077110 the eu grand strategy is to develop georgia as an alternative route for caspian oil and gas by bypassing russia
3077111 but if georgia is no longer a safe passageway then all of these schemes for diminished dependency on russia go up in smoke
3077112 the first significant break in russias previous monopoly control over all oil and natural gas from the caspian sea states
3077113 azerbaijan and georgia for example rely on this pipeline for the political independence they often act out
3077114 an alternative pathway for the flow of caspian oil and gas to the west
3077115 georgia has been one of the leading recipients of u s military aid ever since
3077116 this of course infuriated the russians and they determined to try to curb georgias ties to the west in any way they possibly could
3077117 he came towards her and there was a grapple between the two he smelt very strongly of intoxicating liquor
3077118 he put his face up to hers she was terrified
3077119 you have brought shame on yourself your family and norfolk constabulary
3077120 it is my fervent wish that military actions cease immediately
3077121 refrain also in the name of a common christian heritage from further confrontations and violent retaliations that could degenerate into a wider conflict
3077122 i also invite the international community and the countries most influential in the current situation to make every effort to sustain and promote initiatives aimed at reaching a peaceful and lasting solution one which favors open and respectful coexistence
3077123 there is a need for a stable peace here because it is a fuse that could make an entire continent explode
3077124 i make an appeal which is also a prayer a supplication to the lord and to all people of good will that they understand how this kind of war produces only destruction and places at risk the poorest and weakest
3077125 many people are coming to tbilisi from georgian villages around tskhinvali and from gori their houses have been damaged and theyre escaping the bombardment

3077132 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior
3077133 although there is a need for further research including research on the effects of different colors our results suggest a need to change the rules or support referees by providing electronic decision making aids in those sports in which this color bias may be a problem

3077142 before coming to ethiopia reconnecting with my family was sometimes a source of anxiety as i wondered how they have changed if they wouldremember me if they would even like this cousin or niece from americawho has had relatively little contact or communication with them
3077143 when i first got there they kissed and hugged me
3077144 they were so excited to see me and some were crying
3077145 but when i walked into the compound she was running toward me
3077146 she just liked to talk to me she didnt care if i understood
3077147 as i talked to my dad about his experiences in the meserete kristos church as a believer in the late 1960s and 1970s i became more intrigued with his personal story of persecution by the ethiopian orthodox church
3077148 this dynamic really interested me and so i decided to pursue studying the relationship between the orthodox church and the meserete kristos church by examining it on a personal level through the stories and narratives of individual believers beginning with my dad
3077149 tropic thunder is an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
3077150 we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future however no changes or cuts to the film will be made

3077199 the eu grand strategy is to develop georgia as an alternative route for caspian oil and gas by bypassing russia
3077200 but if georgia is no longer a safe passageway then all of these schemes for diminished dependency on russia go up in smoke
3077201 the first significant break in russias previous monopoly control over all oil and natural gas from the

3077228 the jobs market has been one of the few bright spots in the uk economy but cracks are appearing in the face of an increasingly uncertain economic outlook
3077229 even if we avoid the scale of jobs fallout suffered in previous downturns the era of the candidates recruitment market is already over with people in work becoming increasingly anxious that their p45 might soon be on its way

3077237 only spain played in a different style only the characteristics of their play was different but i have a lot of confidence in my team and i think we will be ok
3077238 the level at the euros was good we have that same level or better
3077239 i must transmit the spirit of those teams to the players to play with confidence in our four games so far step by step we have been getting better

3077244 the opening will mark the halfway mark of an ambitious project under the australia indonesia partnership to build or expand 2000 high schools across 20 provinces by the end of 2009
3077245 australia is funding this program to help indonesia fulfil its vision that all young indonesians will have nine years of basic education
3077246 our construction alone will create some 330 000 new places in junior high schools including in some of indonesias poorest and remote areas
3077247 in all challenges indonesia can count on australia to work with it as a friend and partner
3077248 there is no excuse for what happened and we are addressing it right now

3077251 given the sharp rally in local interest rate markets banks could cut mortgage rates today if they wanted
3077252 after all one of the majors westpac last week reported robust revenue growth of 8 9 per cent anticipated and was on track for 6 8 per cent cash earnings growth for 2008
3077253 other banks will grow their profits despite difficult conditions globally
3077254 a key fact here is that the 90 day bank bill rate has fallen sharply over the past 10 days
3077255 i suspect the major banks will follow any initial 25 basis points rba cut with a 20 25 basis point cut in mortgage rates whereas a 50 basis point rba cut might be followed by a 40 50 basis point cut in mortgage rates
3077256 it wouldnt surprise me to see one of the big four break ranks
3077257 then we might start seeing some competition but its not a foregone conclusion none of them will give an undertaking to pass on the full cut
3077258 i imagine there wouldve been phone calls from higher up given theres big profits coming out
3077259 eliminate all good sculpture from parks and buildings substitute shapeless awkward and meaningless forms
3077260 an ominous feeling something was going to happen something which had been planned for a long time
3077261 there are leaders who become an obstacle sometimes those leaders need to contemplate how useful they have become to their people
3077262 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3077263 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3077264 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3077265 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3077266 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3077267 i have had a long career but the girl who beat me is almost half my age so it becomes very difficult
3077268 it stung so much at the start that i thought i was going to throw up but it seems to have settled down dywer said

3077272 that the sec probe centers on whether mozilos stock trades violated the law and whether the lenders financial disclosures misled investors the executive exercised options on thousands of shares of common stock through a prearranged trading plan but the timing of changes in the stock selling program drew shareholder criticism the changes which were made in the months before the companys stock plunged allowed mozilo to significantly increase his sales of countrywide shares
3077273 is set to review an agreement in which countrywide agreed to pay a bankruptcy trustee 325 000 to settle allegations that the mortgage lender sought improper fees or payments from bankrupt homeowners and otherwise violated bankruptcy court orders and regulations in nearly 300 cases countrywide acknowledged errors in handling some debts but it had denied any systematic effort to thwart bankruptcy protections to collect money countrywide is also among the companies being investigated by the fbi as part of the agencys probe into the financial services industry in the wake of the mortgage meltdown
3077274 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3077275 whoever is wise let him attend to these things let them consider the steadfast love of the lord
3077276 thine eye diffused a quickening ray i woke the dungeon flamed with light my chains fell off my heart was free i rose went forth and followed thee

3077278 in the company of other historic hotels and inns all over america that share in the commitment to historic preservation
3077279 understanding how elephants and other animal populations react to droughts will be a central component of wildlife management and conservation
3077280 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3077281 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia
3077282 climate change is expected to lead to a higher occurrence of severe drought in africa and our study suggests that such extreme climatic events may act as a selection force on animal populations

3077295 they were part of an aggregation for an entire area and we put huge money into each one of them in terms of planning and they were originally acquired for our overall aspirations and intention for the south of lichfield area
3077296 just to put this in perspective this represents about 5 per cent of our property holdings theres no money in this for us
3077297 im not excited about this transaction we get emotionally involved in our developments and im pretty upset that i cant refinance these and have to look at reselling them
3077298 the sites are valuable to the city because they are big sites and they form a real part of the south of lichfield plan
3077299 until the creditors meetings we had been talking to dave and we always felt we were in the loop his interests were the same as our interests
3077300 we were relying on that goodwill and wed been talking to dave for some time about integrating his sites with our sites
3077301 they knew everything about the deal a week later the same decision would have been made
3077302 what we paid for the properties is irrelevant because he will buy them back off us
3077303 if we had just waited and let the market take its course we could have bought at the real price
3077304 bailout for an individual and i do not believe in the council doing that

3077307 it encourages viewers and provides them with information there will be no dilution or fragmentation of the national audience
3077308 what national is proposing is a punitive stick a one size fits all approach that is lacking any intellectual grit
3077309 this crowd in washington they believe they own the white house they dont think the people own it they think its theirs and theyve kept it for a generation by dividing the people by terrifying the people by convincing the people their opponents are aliens from outer space somewhere and thats what theyre going to do this time thats all they know how to do
3077310 republican presidential candidate sen john mccain today apologized for events a week ago at a campaign stop in panama city when a secret service agent asked me the only black reporter present to leave a media area while other state reporters were allowed to stay
3077311 i just wanted to call and personally apologize to you
3077312 well absolutely make sure nothing like that ever happens again
3077313 i have no idea sir it had nothing to do with my staff or anyone who is employed with me i think it was a very bad thing that happened
3077314 there was no significant loss of life in those towers not a one
3077315 this attack happened in my hometown a hometown i do not live in or work in because of illegal behavior i hope those who swiped my ability to live there enjoy the message they got from god today
3077316 in that building existed little more than a bunch of companies which
3077317 now you know what its like to see your horrors mocked the way mine have been thats not mental illness thats a political message apparently delivered quite brilliantly
3077318 there was no significant loss of life in those towers their own evil
3077319 i did feel for a long period that there wasnt anything new to buy
3077320 but i really like the slim fit its not so roomy not so bulky and its a lot cleaner
3077321 this is a trend that you have to buy otherwise you look outdated
3077322 suddenly a pair of cargo pants and a polo shirt doesnt look good anymore
3077323 womens wear has painted themselves in a corner by offering too many options and with everything a trend it is very easy not to buy anything
3077324 if you are keeping up with fashion people notice and it gives them more confidence
3077325 i had looked in the mirror and never was impressed i looked like a little kid who was waiting to grow into his clothes
3077326 i feel extremely confident in the way i look everyone has noticed
3077327 they thought he had wavey hair until they shaved his head and noticed it was his head that was wavey
3077328 i know his grandmother lives in hawaii and i know hawaii is a state but it has the look of him going off to some sort of foreign exotic place he should be at myrtle beach and if hes going to take a vacation at this time i just think this is not the time to do that
3077329 there was no significant loss of life in those towers not a one
3077330 this attack happened in my hometown a hometown i do not live in or work in because of illegal behavior i hope those who swiped my ability to live there enjoy the message they got from god today

3077332 now you know what its like to see your horrors mocked the way mine have been thats not mental illness thats a political message apparently delivered quite brilliantly
3077333 there was no significant loss of life in those towers their own evil

3077335 so far we have worked the plan and i think the rest of the other guys can work the plan as well
3077336 we are all focused we have got five very very good competitors here and they are all winners in their own right
3077337 we wished after athens that we could have the chance to go for it again and prove that we can do it and that we really were all very willing to go for it
3077338 definitely there is a spirit for now it is our time
3077339 at the first minute and the second minute i was down by 10 seconds and down by 15 seconds
3077340 i thought well i need to make sure i keep a lid on this and to maintain that i really felt that i had to take some risks and take out strides somewhere get distances that were a little bit wild
3077341 it was a great feeling i cant tell you how touching it is when you are going around and there are people yelling go aussie go clayton even go ben
3077342 we believe that no contact means just that no contact
3077343 i dont understand why is it bad im just the dog
3077344 according to your faith will it be done to you
3077345 while they were eating jesus took bread gave thanks and broke it and gave it to his disciples saying

3077349 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3077350 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3077355 nobody has pushed the limits of the science fiction genre quite this hard and i think george is the perfect individual to bring this unique vision to the screen
3077356 but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3077357 nor can one reply that this is not a matter of faith because even if it is not a matter of faith because of the subject matter it is still a matter of faith because of the speaker
3077358 die familienbeihilfe ist seit dem 1 1 2000 nicht mehr erh ht worden das hei t es gibt hier auch keine inflationsanpassung seit 2000 daher glaube ich es ist ein gebot der stunde diese direkte f rderung an die familien auch tats chlich zu erh hen

3077362 diese f rderung w re zu breit und zu teuer wir w rden vor allem kinderreiche familien in schlechten einkommensverh ltnissen besonders f rdern das w ren zum beispiel ausl nderfamilien die traditionell viele kinder haben das ist zwar sch n und gut kann aber nicht der alleinige focus dieser steuerreform sein
3077363 eine erh hung von beihilfen hat nichts mit einer steuerentlastung zu tun
3077364 in den letzten 15 jahren ist das pflegegeld erst drei mal und zwar 1994 1995 und zuletzt 2005 erh ht worden jetzt ist es allerh chste zeit der pensionistenverband begr t die initiative von sozialminister buchinger ab 1 1 2009 das pflegegeld um 5 prozent anzuheben
3077365 unser vorschlag ist daher 5 prozent erh hung des pflegegelds ber alle stufen und besondere zuschl ge f r demenzerkrankte personen und schwerbehinderte kinder und jugendliche
3077366 400 000 bezieherinnen von pflegegeld und ihre familien brauchen diese erh hung gerade jetzt da die inflation immer neue rekorde erreicht d rfen wir die betroffenen nicht warten lassen
3077367 wenn minister buchinger meint dass eine einmaligen erh hung des pflegegeldes in dieser periode bis einschlie lich 2010 um 3 prozent die situation pflegebed rftiger menschen bessert kann ich ihm nur eine deutliche absage erteilen

3077377 the obstacles are many because this is such a disruptive new technology that is difficult to explain to so many in education who have no
3077378 i had a terrible personality for a cpa internal auditing helped me understand businesses and learning investor relations and discover a passion for business operations
3077379 no one understands the company like you do trust your gut listen to your intuition
3077380 i have ridiculously strong expectations of myself it is only fair that i expect the same of others
3077381 it is important to set priorities and stick to them
3077382 make sure that you spend time with the kids my husband and i are in this together i have a strong partner who is supportive and understanding
3077383 when the kids get home from school and they are excited to talk about their day
3077384 someone smashed one of the alarm call points after a big night out we know exactly who it was and the guest has been charged 1500 for the call out fee and to fix the call point
3077385 it was a fairly big stuff up by the guest and when she was asked why she did it she said she had no idea and she was upset and disappointed with herself she left next day
3077386 we were about 75 per cent full so thats about 200 people and we aim to get everyone out in about three minutes
3077387 its completely surreal and we are really uneasy we dont dare any more to propose any price below 100 million for these clients anything below and they throw you out and you should see how they do it
3077388 there was obvious signs of violence the motive for the deaths is not known
3077389 they were the most respected people in town i cant see anyone who would want to kill them
3077390 australians dont have much respect for the music press it runs counter to their culture australian rock is all about good on ya mate well done for getting up on stage and switching that amplifier on
3077391 the idea of anyone actually daring to criticise musicians for the sound they make is almost heresy everyone is treated equally which means no knocking anyone back however great the temptation thatll be why australian rock is best known to the outside world for such musical abominations as silverchair the vines and savage garden
3077392 its a really poor piece of journalism from a music writer who once had relevance and influence but now hes living in australia he doesnt really have the knowledge or experience of the local industry to back up his opinions
3077393 its just a shame he gets to hide under the masthead of the guardian which gives him credence where none is due
3077394 i think there are parts of the british press that seem to enjoy denigrating their subjects
3077395 but i certainly dont think it is something that happens all the time
3077396 judging by the response obviously there is which is nice
3077397 we should have been at the hospital a long time ago

3077401 the first thing i want to do is entertain and the second is to inform
3077402 theres so much stuff about this war that people really dont know about
3077403 my father is very pro war hes not very happy how things have gone he really enjoyed the performance and recommends it to all his republican friends that theres a lot of good information in it of course when i got in the car and got home i got a lecture about how he thinks things are but he really enjoyed it
3077404 if youre willing to laugh at bush and blair playing with dolls together that takes you out of your political realm
3077405 the way were talking about it is very typical of the way theyve had us talking about it that its one or the other democrat or republican we take silly swipes that may come off as partisan but the really good stuff is the satire of things that offend everybody regardless of their political background

3077414 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior
3077415 although there is a need for further research including research on the effects of different colors our results suggest a need to change the rules or support referees by providing electronic decision making aids in those sports in which this color bias may be a problem
3077416 given the sharp rally in local interest rate markets banks could cut mortgage rates today if they wanted
3077417 after all one of the majors westpac last week reported robust revenue growth of 8 9 per cent anticipated and was on track for 6 8 per cent cash earnings growth for 2008
3077418 other banks will grow their profits despite difficult conditions globally
3077419 a key fact here is that the 90 day bank bill rate has fallen sharply over the past 10 days
3077420 i suspect the major banks will follow any initial 25 basis points rba cut with a 20 25 basis point cut in mortgage rates whereas a 50 basis point rba cut might be followed by a 40 50 basis point cut in mortgage rates
3077421 it wouldnt surprise me to see one of the big four break ranks
3077422 then we might start seeing some competition but its not a foregone conclusion none of them will give an undertaking to pass on the full cut
3077423 i imagine there wouldve been phone calls from higher up given theres big profits coming out

3077426 go for it mr uhlich you rock but please dont leave your my fav teacher
3077427 this whole genre of model programs sends a very strong message to young people that your main capacity for success in this world is to market yourself sexually
3077428 instead of being part of the solution this teacher is part of the problem
3077429 hes helping to generate these very very toxic messages that are driving young girls to body image problems and eating disorders and other psychological difficulties
3077430 its not the behaviour parents would expect from a teacher who is a role model for students under their care
3077431 the school community wishes rhys well hes a very popular teacher with the staff students and parents and we cant wait to have him back at school
3077432 i love teaching kids but i need a bit of variety in my life
3077433 members are required to wander along the roads indulgin in conversation song and story and eatin at regular intervals from the pudding
3077434 the effect human beings have on the landscape around them is the theme of bakers most recent tour de force
3077435 expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now
3077436 isnt this amazing now you see why i love this place
3077437 we assume team x will do this and team y will do that if they dont were not responsible when our plan fails

3077439 i was born bred and raised in clover park and i am still very much involved in my community
3077440 it has allowed me to build a strong foundation for the trust by getting important operational procedures in place
3077441 why you were passionate about what you were wanting to do
3077442 the foundation is really involved in helping groups who work with the young people who will be the future leaders of new zealand
3077443 so i want to thank them for working in partnership with me this year it has definitely made a world of difference for the young people in this community
3077444 so if you are passionate and want to do something in your community to help young people then this programme is the way to go
3077445 she thought she deserved parity and shes got a point
3077446 getting involved in these sorts of things isnt about awards its about doing it because it needs to be done
3077447 the trust has amazing people that it calls on all the time for help and it shows that when everyone does a little a lot can be achieved
3077448 he has come in and taken up the challenge of the trust and i admire that
3077449 when you publish community newspapers surely you have an obligation to give something back to the community
3077450 peter often says the most precious thing you can give someone is your time and he certainly gives plenty of his to the trust
3077451 the energy and drive he brings makes that time twice as valuable
3077452 its a bit embarrassing when you get called a hero but the real heroes are the people who turn out to help us event after event or give

3077459 i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world
3077460 actually we dont disagree as much as youd think i think people assume im a democrat but im registered independent and im still undecided so im looking at mccain as well as obama
3077461 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior
3077462 to determine how early childhood education can be provided on school sites
3077463 it is a solution that the community board has advocated for
3077464 we believe the ministry has to have a more active role in the future of our children instead of just leaving it to the market there is a clear connection between the success of children in the education sector and those who have enjoyed quality preschool education
3077465 the situation is not acceptable and that manurewa deserves special attention and focused flexible responses to our particular needs
3077466 when young people are out of the learning environment at an early age with few options for both their families and the schools we find that they drift into all kinds of unsuitable associations and behaviours
3077467 we need provision here in manurewa to support the schools and the youngsters

3077478 como no me alcanzaba el tiempo para hacer todo la capataz viviana vallejos me retaba y cagaba a pedos y me dec a que me ayuden mi se ora y mis hijos
3077479 los chiquitos trabajan porque no alcanza el tiempo para terminar con todo el trabajo
3077480 los que van a la ma ana a la escuela trabajan de tarde y los que van a la tarde al colegio laburan a la ma ana porque si ellos no trabajan no se llega a cumplir con la producci n que exigen
3077481 cuando nos enferm bamos no nos dejaban ir al hospital y nos daban una bolsita de pastillas de colores en la oficina de la capataz
3077482 cuando tom s esas pastillas no ten s hambre ni sue o y segu s trabajando

3077494 we were at mannys house when the trade went down and theyre asking manny what number he wanted
3077495 no 24 was taken and no 42 was not available he was thinking no 34 in honor of big papi but that wasnt available they text back a list 28 33 50 65 94 95 96 so manny turned to me and asked you pick a number
3077496 at first i thought no 66 after route 66 but then i said why dont you take my number i always wear no 99 he said ok lets do it thats how manny chose no 99
3077497 pre pma 2008 memory maker atp has launched what it describes as
3077498 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3077499 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3077500 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3077501 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3077502 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3077503 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3077504 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3077505 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3077506 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3077507 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3077508 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3077509 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3077510 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3077511 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3077512 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3077513 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3077514 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3077515 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3077516 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3077517 es lindo ganar una final y m s a brasil
3077518 wennemer will not do anything that will lead to a lasting destruction in shareholder value
3077519 do you now have a better estimate of when american forces can come home from iraq
3077520 whats important is casualties in iraq americans are in south korea americans are in japan american troops are in germany thats all fine
3077521 we as americans can be proud of the kind of people we are as we have never retained a square foot of any country we have defeated we possess no empire no man or woman call us master as we have never subjugated any society
3077522 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3077523 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3077524 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3077525 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3077526 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3077527 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3077528 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3077529 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3077530 sarge was the guy who made us feel we could win
3077531 ive seen a tape of the game they had the credits going over the screen and they named willie mcgee the player of the game right in the middle of the credits bob costas goes nuts hes done it again and hit a home run again it was just like a fairy tale game for me
3077532 the thing i remember the most about 84 was the way the whole 25 man team came together
3077533 there was nobody who had an attitude there was nobody out there playing for themselves it was 25 guys trying to win a game every day thats a special thing when you can get a group together like that
3077534 all of a sudden it hit me these are the cubs the chicago cubs beating the heck out of people bullies thats what weve become big bad mean bullies and oh boy does it feel great why didnt we think of this years ago
3077535 i cant recall if i ever touched it or nipped it or what
3077536 it was one of those crazy type balls that came at you that you think would come up but never came up
3077537 and i think thats what made it more important and a bigger thrill for me because nobody picked us and our guys played so good little things they did every little thing
3077538 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3077539 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3077540 steampunk maker datamancer has just unveiled his latest a pc called
3077541 it shows that we have a lot of tough minded guys who know how to play the game
3077542 we play every game with meaning and feeling we dont look past that one game i think it explains why we are good on the road our ability not to look past todays game
3077543 when were playing a good team we have to bring our best because we know were going to see their best they bring out the best in us our athleticism and competitiveness
3077544 if we can go six innings and keep us in the game our seventh eighth and ninth inning guys are so good you have to like our chances sure we all want to go nine but its pretty comforting if you go six and know those three guys are down there
3077545 we never get wrapped up in one game we move on to the next one its been the nature of this team since ive been here i think it starts with mike scioscia and runs through the team
3077546 sure it would be awesome to get to 20 wins
3077547 but when my team wins i win if i get the w kudos to me but if i dont and we win im a happy man
3077548 the core name is and will be our flagship pc processor brand going forward expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now
3077549 just like a mother in law still around and not going anywhere any time soon
3077550 the only mistake that he has made was the price he advertised the bike for was too cheap
3077551 the offenders could have placed the ads from anywhere in the world
3077552 in all the auras i have seen and ive seen thousands youre only the third i have seen like that
3077553 no no its a good thing this black here is the depth of your knowledge everything i could tell you about life you already know youve got such wisdom such experience just not on a conscious level but you know that
3077554 youll look back at yourself in four or five years time and not even recognise the space you are in now you will have changed so much that glow over your heart shows youve got so much love to give youre a humanitarian i see you in front of thousands of people
3077555 weve been waiting for it to get started for a long time
3077556 gt freshers telecom jobs lt gt tata indicom delhi ncr
3077557 but they all need something to drive off them and its usually a baler or thresher or chaff cutter or sawmill those had all been done so i decided to make a scale model of the collett crusher
3077558 i knew it would work im an engineer if something is built properly it will work
3077559 well it was mainly for safety reasons we had a lot of children running about there and i didnt want them throwing rocks in and maybe causing an accident
3077560 ive never fired the boiler it works the same on air and makes all the right noises
3077561 if its running hot at a public display you have to keep kids away and it needs certifying by a qualified person
3077562 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3077563 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3077564 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3077565 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3077566 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3077567 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3077568 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3077569 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3077570 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3077571 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3077572 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

3077578 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3077579 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3077580 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3077581 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3077582 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3077583 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3077584 elderly or disabled people who cant reach the ceiling should phone their local fire station and someone will do the battery change for them but they wont be supplying any batteries

3077588 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3077589 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3077590 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3077591 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3077592 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3077593 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3077594 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3077595 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3077596 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3077597 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3077598 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3077599 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

3077680 most dominicans living in the us want nothing more than to save up their money
3077681 the united states is no longer the economic power house it used to be
3077682 we lift ourselves by our thought we climb upon our vision of ourselves if you want to enlarge your life you must first enlarge your thought of it and of yourself hold the ideal of yourself as you long to be always everywhere your ideal of what you long to attain the ideal of health efficiency success
3077683 i learned this at least by my experiment that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours he will put some things behind will pass an invisible boundary new universal and more liberal laws will begin to establish themselves around and within him or the old laws will be expanded and interpreted in his favor in a more liberal sense and he will live with the license of a higher order of beings
3077684 a sniper war is ongoing against residents of the villages in the south ossetian conflict zone and as i speak now intensive fire is ongoing from artillery from tanks from self propelled artillery systems which have been brought in the conflict zone illegally and from other types of weaponry including mortars and grenade launchers

3077686 your time is limited so dont waste it living someone elses life dont be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other peoples thinking dont let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice and most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition they somehow already know what you truly want to become everything else is secondary

3077689 i think baseball and softball will be reinstated in the olympic format i think in 09 they will vote it back in they have been lobbying hard behind the scenes i think that vote is going to be baseballs return
3077690 the fact is we are trying to meet a whole lot of concerns the ioc had mainly doping standards all these things have been addressed our doping standards are the most stringent in all of major league sports
3077691 all those programs have really grown the dutch program is doing well as well as italy i hope this wont affect those programs in 2012
3077692 in the next eight years the world baseball classic will take on the life of what world cup soccer is players are taking it a lot more seriously we had a lot of guys coming in who want to participate
3077693 i wish we were like 10 games up or 20 games down then id get a 10 game suspension but my team is going through a pretty tough time right now and i have to be with them 100 percent i let my club down for two days
3077694 after you see greinke hit swisher that clicks in your mind like whats going on here you start looking around like are they abusing my team or do they think were scared thats why i made that comment a lot of people thought when we went to kansas city we were going to have some problems i didnt do anything because i truly believe those guys didnt throw at my players
3077695 now i know i cant do anything about it because theyre going to have a warning theyre going to be looking at me ill just move on quiet and im not going to start anything i will finish something but im not going to start
3077696 there was an environment that was not conducive to winning surrounding this club
3077697 believe me its easier for us not to face ramirez but i dont think theyre going to make the trade if they feel they dont still have a good offense without him did the trade surprise me i dont know what went on there but it did surprise me sometimes people need to get something done to show they lead the ballclub
3077698 it surprised me when it happened i would have bet my house and everything and i would have lost but the red sox do good business they know what theyre doing and you have to respect that
3077699 i dont know because i wasnt there but believe me i never think mannys a quitter and he never will be thats the way he played the game but they created their own monster they created manny manny was manny and now all of a sudden mannys not manny thats their business and i wasnt there but i dont think mannys a quitter i dont
3077700 players react in different ways i know he was upset
3077701 hes in our rotation weve done this dance before hes in our rotation
3077702 what do you think you think its fun watching that crap silly question
3077703 what was it a bunch of singles and three doubles im just not real upset about it im just going to move on and ive already done that
3077704 i could tell he was upset with the way he pitched when i went out there some guys are able to say whats on their mind some guys sometimes arent able to say whats exactly on their mind its something i will talk to ian about
3077705 some guys understand how to handle the media a little better than others its important that we know his heart not necessarily that everyone does
3077706 it was a hundred percent the right move to make weve come up with so many situations where we havent gotten that extra hit i think it would be foolish to lay back and let the game come to us you have to play to win
3077707 hes trying to get 90 feet closer i dont have a problem with it whatsoever
3077708 i just havent felt comfortable stealing bases because of my leg i havent felt strong or fast or quick you see me get picked off i cant even be as quick as i want coming back to the bag
3077709 its pretty tough to play on the artificial turf it grabs your hamstring every time you take a step
3077710 its soft but its like walking on sand it makes you work muscles that you dont have to work elsewhere or on natural grass
3077711 weve had some preliminary conversations via e mail with scouts to get their thoughts on who might be available at this point in time and see what fits for us because of my travel schedule i havent had a chance to talk to cooper about where we are in the next couple of days well have a chance to have that dialogue
3077712 thats a tough one to lose a guy from your team is hard but carlos is a guy who has been in the last month or two carrying this team we felt like we had a chance now we lose one of the best hitters on the team and its hard im sorry for him because i think this year could have been one of the best years of his life its not good
3077713 in the meantime getting abercrombie up there gives us depth off the bench and its great to have a guy like darin erstad with our club that can play left field for us
3077714 that would certainly sell tickets id love to have him on the team i think he would be great if he could perform at a level were accustomed to seeing if hell play for the minimum league salary i would certainly take a flier on that
3077715 ive never felt this good in my career at the plate i believed i was going to help the team to make a comeback and do the best for the team but now im out its pretty bad i have to get it operated on and they say six to eight weeks so probably im out for the year unless the guys make a comeback and ill be back for the playoffs
3077716 with men in scoring position hes just been an awesome player getting big hit after big hit hes carried us over the last month and a half or so with home runs base hits and hes played terrific defensively its a big hole to fill
3077717 the yankees knew i wanted to go to boston they picked up my option so i wouldnt wind up there i would have loved it because i love that atmosphere in boston it means something at this stage of my career i want to feel that again thats what i play for thats what gets me revved up
3077718 i can be in the outfield and play every day i dont want to dh i dont feel like a baseball player when i dh i dont know how to be the leader that i am from the bench i cant be a vocal leader i cant talk to guys from the bench because i dont feel right about it
3077719 im in a role now where i dont know what to do really the guys are out there busting their butt for nine innings they come in and they hit and they grind i just sit down and hit thats all i do so i cant be in a leadership role from that position
3077720 i dont prefer platooning here but i understand because i got off to a slow start thats part of it but i feel im playing better now im back to being a threat i need to be i dont get pitched the same like everybody else i get pitched very carefully now that im a lot better physically i can handle tough pitching i can be the player that i know i am
3077721 broxtons our guy hes a guy you can trust stuff like that happens its how you respond and come back
3077722 i have no reservations with his makeup he has the equipment to be a closer if anything he may go over the top and try to overthrow the ball once he trusts his splitter he could be devastating he reminds me a little of don mcmahon a big guy who throws hard and doesnt say much
3077723 he asked how short i said id get back to him to me its a sensitive issue for a player thats been doing something for a long time as a player id be turned off if i was told now that youre here do this and this and this well have to see the results if that happens im out of town its a long homestand i could be taking a beating i never imagined when i started managing 25 years ago id be talking about this some old timers would be spinning in their graves over this
3077724 i remember watching ferguson jenkins in spring training he ran the whole game line to line the entire game and everybody wondered why he went 300 innings he ran
3077725 i dont think the pitchers made bad pitches tonight i was just able to hit them
3077726 i know for a fact there were a lot of guys in the past who just got too old because nobody saw them they were good players who didnt make it because nobody saw them play now its easier because every team is down there if youre good somebody is going to know that
3077727 we definitely jumped into the deep end involved with the yankees red sox dodgers and being very deep into conversations with other clubs too but i came away very pleased with the process with the dynamic in the room
3077728 i said that the united states doesnt even know who was on that team four years ago but we are still talking about this team that lost the passion venezuela has for baseball is different from everywhere else every other week they come up with something different about that competition
3077729 now if he goes out and busts his butt its different it may happen for a week or two weeks or three weeks but at one point in time hes going to get comfortable and go back into being a one gait player
3077730 we appreciate all of joses hard work and professionalism we wanted to have every opportunity to try and trade him even though that opportunity may still exist now that weve passed the july 31 deadline it was important for us to continue our transition into a club that is looking towards the 2009 season even as we try to win as many games as possible this season
3077731 when i was a kid growing up the oakland as would fight each other every single why they called them the fighting they won the world championship its not a major deal its what happens it makes teams better
3077732 weve got to win man weve got to win weve got to start doing things to win ballgames weve got an awesome team weve got a great team weve got all the talent to win everything but weve got to start winning

3077737 the mother called police shortly before 3 a m and mr panettiere was taken into custody
3077738 hes been cooperative earlier they were at a party and the husband apparently felt disrespected by his wife
3077739 you dont think there are some deluded americans hey how about all of us everyone here is obsessed with tabloid celebrities and their lives and wanting to be like that just like kim

3077743 upon the conclusion of our investigation the big ten is secure in its belief that these games were not compromised
3077744 last year we were able to hold a roster spot open for gary as he attempted to make a monumental comeback after he underwent a knee scope last week we are unfortunately not in a position to hold a roster spot this year we are releasing gary today in hopes he will be able to continue his rehab and get back into the nfl either with another team or possibly with the browns gary has made tremendous strides thus far and we believe he can play professional football again in the future

3077761 it is a good outcome provided they can maintain what they say they are going to do it is ok by me
3077762 we are retired so putting back the repayment does not worry us at all
3077763 we have met with elliott international a us hedge fund on several occasions over the last 12 months to discuss their views on telecoms strategic direction including the implications of structural separation
3077764 its coming up about three months this weekend and ive had the clearance from the specialist to get back into it so that was basically my first run with the team
3077765 i broke my radius it was a complete break and i had a rod inserted through the canal in my bone and ive actually had the same one done in the other arm
3077766 it was quite a severe break huricanes wing hosea gear was running with the ball i went to tackle him and my forearm hit his knee hes a strong boy and bringing his knees up through sprinting there was a fair bit of force behind it and i was going in quite strongly with my arm too
3077767 it was two forces colliding so someone had to come off second best and the radius isnt that big a bone
3077768 but thats just rugby it comes with its ups and it comes with its downs and its about how you manage them at the end of the day im nearly back so the frustration has been and gone
3077769 im not a good watcher of rugby and ive tried to stay out of it as much as possible because i found myself getting frustrated
3077770 obviously i was around at the start of the campaign when we were doing our team building but once we got into the season leading up to the manawatu and otago games i pretty much kept clear and let the boys get on with their jobs
3077771 i cant really say if im able to get through training and tick all the right boxes then i could be anywhere from one to three weeks away but it all depends on how it the arm reacts to getting stuck in
3077772 they were part of an aggregation for an entire area and we put huge money into each one of them in terms of planning and they were originally acquired for our overall aspirations and intention for the south of lichfield area
3077773 just to put this in perspective this represents about 5 per cent of our property holdings theres no money in this for us
3077774 im not excited about this transaction we get emotionally involved in our developments and im pretty upset that i cant refinance these and have to look at reselling them
3077775 the sites are valuable to the city because they are big sites and they form a real part of the south of lichfield plan
3077776 until the creditors meetings we had been talking to dave and we always felt we were in the loop his interests were the same as our interests
3077777 we were relying on that goodwill and wed been talking to dave for some time about integrating his sites with our sites
3077778 they knew everything about the deal a week later the same decision would have been made
3077779 what we paid for the properties is irrelevant because he will buy them back off us
3077780 if we had just waited and let the market take its course we could have bought at the real price
3077781 bailout for an individual and i do not believe in the council doing that
3077782 there was a lack of consultation on such a significant decision by the council which i find totally unacceptable and potentially unlawful
3077783 from our perspective that was not unexpected but people have kind of assumed that if they lock themselves up in their houses that theyre protected theyre not
3077784 outside air pollution gets into houses relatively quickly and the levels that we detected were basically the same inside and out
3077785 every day they were measuring stuff for us it was a colossal piece of work
3077786 what national is proposing is a punitive stick a one size fits all approach that is lacking any intellectual grit
3077787 where theres life theres hope but this is gut wrenching to be quite frank
3077788 theres been a lot of time effort and resources go into trying to make tasman a success there were players staff fans and sponsors who had confidence in what we were trying to do
3077789 at the end of the day its never an easy decision to accept and the staff feel the same
3077790 if we are not going to be in the air new zealand cup next year we are going to have to downsize and reduce our staff players will have to look elsewhere
3077791 its a bitter pill to swallow but life goes on
3077792 one of the arguments for the allowances is youre never not a public figure any more you are always a public figure once youve been prime minister and or governor general that carries with it certain responsibilities

3077796 hated the score the animation the shots the characters and most of all the retarded idiot story
3077797 i was tired of going to the office every day
3077798 i had friends that were getting sick or had even died so i started asking myself what in the world i was still working for
3077799 i am now revisiting what we should be invested in
3077800 im trying to decide if there is a better way a more intelligent way to guarantee me a better return over the long haul
3077801 the risk of running out of money within 30 years of retirement climbs dramatically if you choose to retire at the beginning of a bear market
3077802 someone who retired in 2000 is in danger of running out of money
3077803 our recommendation is that when you have a bear market like this one and we dont see the light at the end of the tunnel yet it is not a good time to retire
3077804 your portfolio is already down so now you will start to withdraw from the portfolio you will just make a bad situation worse
3077805 the worst thing is not having the nest egg you want when you do retire that is incredibly disappointing get over this idea that you just cant work another day maybe you can change the kind of work you do so its refreshing and different but brings in some money
3077806 the fact that tracfone on its phones may lock the code and making some minor branding modifications does not render the motorola or nokia software a property of tracfone

3077809 i can remember asking the question during our war gaming and the development of our plan okay we are in baghdad what next no real good answers came forth
3077810 the lesson is to not let your ego or grudges get in the way of hiring absolutely the best people i dont think the american people are fundamentally ideological theyre pragmatic and so i have an interest in casting a wide net seeking out people with a wide range of expertise including republicans
3077811 some have suggested that detainee abuses committed by u s personnel at abu ghraib in iraq and at guantanamo were the result of a few bad apples acting on their own it would be a lot easier to accept if that were true senior officials in the united states government sought out information on aggressive techniques twisted the law to create the appearance of their legality and authorized their use against detainees
3077812 the problem however is that barring an economic meltdown the data we need to verify our oil market argument is unlikely to become available until well after this summer
3077813 the odd thing is that jason furman has a very strong and very wide reputation as an honest broker and as a consensus builder which is exactly the kind of thing that you want in the job as long as you think that truth is on your side and thus that you are more likely than not to win honest substantive evidence based debates its not right to say thatjason furman is closely associated with robert rubin without also saying that he is closely associated with joe stiglitz
3077814 i dont much care if people think im thick because i believe in god but whats really nasty here and its a part of a growing phenomenon is the way religion is being used as a subtle code for race belief in god is alive and well in africa and in the middle east and declining in western europe writing about the intelligence of religious believers has for some become a roundabout way of commenting on the intelligence of those with darker skins whilst seeking to avoid the charge of racism religion is being used with a nod and a wink cover for some rather dodgy and dangerous politics
3077815 in spite of the recent statement from the vatican that synods vote created new obstacles to unity between the anglican and roman catholic churches two facts remain romes official stance is still non recognition of all anglican orders male and female and the anglican church has had women bishops for the last 20 years the question remains as to why the vote presents a fresh obstacle
3077816 i am glad the bureau of land management has arrived at this good decision
3077817 we need to do all we can to encourage public and private investment in projects to develop this amazing potential
3077818 before we can make decisions about our future use of oil and gas and related decisions about protecting endangered species native communities and the health of our planet we need to know whats out there with this assessment were providing the same information to everyone in the world so that the global community can make those difficult decisions
3077819 what about the part where they included outpatient autism cases just at the point where the rate might have dropped if thimerosal was implicated
3077820 however as so often happens in human affairs success led to excess after taming these ancestral scourges physicians sought new challenges and in due course directed their attention to common diseases of childhood
3077821 the first such vaccine was for whooping cough pertussis in 1925 a vaccine for measles followed in 1960 for german measles rubella in 1966 and for mumps in 1967 a vaccine against chicken pox is under preparation today
3077822 researchers and physicians however gave insufficient thought to the difference between the fully grown adult and the newborn baby even in the former the injection of toxic proteins carries a measure of risk injecting the same material into small babies is far more dangerous the adult immune system has been toughened and can withstand the stress of vaccination the two month old baby is inconceivably more vulnerable but that is when immunization commences in the united states
3077823 the rule that vaccination should start at two months earlier in the united states than in any other country is designed mainly for the convenience of pediatricians
3077824 it has become rather well known that when japan raised its minimum vaccination age to two years in 1975 the overall infant mortality rate improved to become the best in the world
3077825 to the best of my knowledge both canada and japan do not mandate vaccines for school entrance vaccines and a certian schedule are recommended to parents
3077826 if you look into my eyes it really will help with the dizziness you might feel aggrieved but you wont feel dizzy
3077827 no man has the right to dictate what other men should perceive create or produce but all should be encouraged to reveal themselves their perceptions and emotions and to build confidence in their creative spirit
3077828 he struggled for his life he couldnt breathe he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3077829 he had sarcoidosis but it was in remission but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
3077830 theyve asked him for a million dollars and i hear hes agreed to give at least 500 000
3077831 obviously when youre talking about donors these are private things i would never reveal information about any donor
3077832 were building a girls school which will bring the best resources from around the world with a specific focus on medicine education and the law and we dont want a brain drain we want to develop the leaders of malawi who stay in malawi and help their country

3077834 i see america as a nation that is a world leader that has got great values
3077835 in the long run america better remain engaged with china and understand that we can have a cooperative and constructive yet candid relationship
3077836 it was just interesting to me that here we are trying to promote peace and harmony and were witnessing a conflict take place
3077837 my attitude is is if you got relations with mr bashir think about helping to solve the humanitarian crisis in darfur that was my message to the chinese government
3077838 i went to church here and im sure the cynics say well you know it was just a state sponsored church on the other hand and thats true on the other hand it gave me a chance to say to the chinese people religion wont hurt you you ought to welcome religious people and it gave me a chance to say to the government why dont you register the underground churches and give them a chance to flourish and he listened politely i cant read his mind but i do know that every time i met with him i pressed the point
3077839 bob its very important for the american people to know that coming here gave me a chance obviously to root for our team and youve captured that but its also coming here is a sign of respect for the chinese people
3077840 leisure industry week is the ultimate event for everyone in the leisure industry its the show that attracts thousands of leisure professionals for hundreds of different reasons every year

3077845 the vast majority of athletes in beijing will be using performance enhancing substances but they will be undetectable
3077846 a lot of people have given their opinion but i only look after myself and what i do
3077847 at beijing we should not concentrate on the medals we win we should be looking at the performances our young athletes should be getting the experience they need in beijing ready to look for medals at the london 2012 olympics
3077848 the claims as to assisting posture back hip and knee problems are not supported by evidence or any good rational explanation indeed the instability provoked will increase the muscle activity and energy required to walk thus increasing fatigue and tiredness
3077849 this is backed up by hannah snow who wore mbts daily for two years and found they toned her muscles but did not get rid of the fine layer of cellulite on the top of her legs

3077856 vikings prospectus and name clearly indicated a very aggressive approach that was appropriate at that time
3077857 it is a good outcome provided they can maintain what they say they are going to do it is okay by me
3077858 we are retired so putting back the repayment does not worry us at all we would have to reinvest anyway in order to make an income

3077891 kami siap menempuh jalur hukum jika nanti pekerjaan kami dinilai melanggar hukum kami memahami pandangan sejarawan tentang kawasan ini namun mengapa baru sekarang menjadi persoalan
3077892 jika ada persoalan tentang kawasan ini mestinya sejak awal kami tidak akan mendapatan izin karena itu sesuai dengan dasar hukum yang kami miliki pembangunan tetap jalan terus kami tidak merasa melanggar hukum
3077893 saya yang mengoordinasi warga melepaskan tanahnya kepada pengembang kami tidak tahu kalau di sini ada bekas benteng putri hijau yang kami tahu di sana sambil menunjuk arah timur ada pancuran putri hijau
3077894 pembangunan bisa terus berjalan tetapi jangan sampai merusak benteng putri hijau benteng itu berbentuk gundukan tanah yang di atasnya mendatar ini bukan hanya sebuah legenda melainkan juga sejarah yang memang pernah ada
3077895 karena itu lebih baik kegiatan pembangunan berhenti untuk sementara waktu balai arkeologi medan dan pussis unimed akan kembali turun ke lokasi untuk melakukan pemetaan berikutnya lebih akurat
3077896 letak persoalannya ada di sini mestinya sejak awal status kawasan ini jelas sebelum ada pembangunan perumahan

3077903 tidak ada alasan lagi bagi wali kota pematang siantar untuk tidak membatalkan sk pengangkatan ke 19 cpns itu
3077904 dari proses penerimaannya kan sudah jelas siapa siapa saja pejabat yang terlibat kalau tahu cpns ini bermasalah mengapa wali kota pematang siantar mengusulkan nip untuk mereka ke bkn dan mengangkat mereka sebagai cpns
3077905 tentu saja kalau memang yang bersangkutan ternyata benar merupakan cpns yang nip nya dibatalkan bkn ia harus mengembalikan biaya pendidikan yang diterimanya kepada negara
3077906 bisa saja mereka mengganti kerugian negara tetapi gaji dan tunjangan ini telah mereka dapatkan karena selama ini mereka juga bekerja

3077920 we knew that the chinese fans were going to be loud and strong as they were last night with the mens game so we were excited to come in and feel that energy in wukesong and it was not disappointing
3077921 im really happy that we started the game stronger than we did against the czechs i thought that we set tempo very quickly and followed through for the 40 minutes so im pleased with the effort
3077922 i think it was a hard fought game very exciting
3077923 the chinese crowd was awesome as usual i was extremely proud of our teams defense we came out and we set the tone we were very aggressive and that kind of created good offensive opportunities for us
3077924 it gives you a lot of confidence as a player to know that when you come in the game the four other players out there with you are all excellent
3077925 and then when you come out you have the confidence that the player coming in for you is going to do a great job i think youre just seeing us have a lot of fun out there still learning to play with one another
3077926 it is not good for the man to be alone i will make a helper suitable for him

3077936 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
3077937 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
3077938 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
3077939 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
3077940 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
3077941 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
3077942 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
3077943 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
3077944 we were actually getting ready to schedule a trip to memphis to talk to isaac
3077945 isaac hayes was a wonderful human begin and his spirit will live long in the form of his music
3077946 even before superbad came out i think the studio was trying to get them to write a sequel but they really didnt want to write a sequel i guess the kids would go to college or something like that and so an answer to that was to do a superbad pineapple express crossover an unprecedented crossover movie with two directors greg motolla and david gordon green each directing half of the movie and somehow these characters get together which doesnt make sense at all but could work
3077947 twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didnt do than by the ones you did do so throw off the bowlines sail away from the safe harbor catch the trade winds in your sails explore dream discover twain
3077948 ethics is how we behave when we decide we belong together
3077949 shit the last time i looked it was 2 25 i cant sleep im so excited i feel like a kid on christmas eve
3077950 the phillies shit they got a ton of guys who can take over a game in late innings itll be even easier giving up a lead to the phillies than it was to the giants
3077951 its hard to go out there and just lose the games in the manner in which weve done so and its doubly hard losing those games to the giants who are an awful awful dreadful team have you seen their record its worse than ours is somehow
3077952 these guys had to work hard to give the game away and the credit is all theirs
3077953 they tell you that the national league is different from the american league but even still thats a bit of an understatement in the al we actually try to win games and you know you want to be in first place not here man not here
3077954 oh yeah giving up four runs in the seventh is the easiest way to hand the game over to the opposing team some guys like to be fancy and do it on the last out of the game not me i like to get my shit over with so that i can head to the clubhouse and grab a beer satisfied that i did my job
3077955 dodgers eagerly awaiting opportunity to blow another 9th inning lead
3077956 blowing a game on a daily basis is no fun i love to tantalize a team and then when you build up their confidence you make sure to go out in a big game and just give it up in my situation they never have anyone warming up as i go out there so i try to make my blown save long and painful i know aaron heilman prefers the quick home run i love a few singles and a few walks in my blown save so i can relish the moment
3077957 too bad i cant get in it i would love to travel cross country with you guys
3077958 we belong to a generation that wants to see the results of our work we want to be productive and see with our own eyes what we have made but that is not the way of gods kingdom often our witness for god does not lead to tangible results jesus himself died as a failure on a cross there was no success there to be proud of still the fruitfulness of jesus life is beyond any human measure as faithful witnesses of jesus we have to trust that our lives too will be fruitful even though we cannot see their fruit the fruit of our lives may be visible only to those who live after us what is important is how well we love god will make our love fruitful whether we see that fruitfulness or not
3077959 pertenecemos a una generaci n que quiere ver los resultados de nuestro trabajo queremos ser productivos y ver con nuestros propios ojos lo que hemos hecho pero esta no es la manera del reino de dios muchas veces nuestro testimonio de jes s no produce resultados tangibles jes s mismo muri como un fracaso en la cruz no existi ning n xito el cual se deb a de estar orgulloso a n as los frutos de la vida de jes s se siguen viendo hasta hoy en d a como testigos fieles de jes s debemos de estar seguros que nuestra vida tambi n ser fruct fera a n aunque no los veamos los frutos de nuestra vida es posible que solo sean visibles para aquellos que vienen despu s de nosotros lo que importa aqu es que tan bien lo amamos dios har que nuestro amor sea fruct ero ya sea que veamos los frutos o no

3077984 we want every american that cares about this issue to call the house switchboard at 202 224 3121 to tell their democratic representative to reconvene congress and vote on increasing american energy
3077985 weve come here to talk about 4 gas were dependent on dysfunctional countries like venezuela for our energy we need energy independence this also means increasing research for renewable fuels nuclear energy and more conservation

3077987 today i returned to the capitol to demand that speaker pelosi returns from her book tour and calls congress back to session to lower energy prices that are crippling small businesses tourism and central florida families
3077988 the call for more drilling has captured the attention of the media and energized the republicans
3077989 but the alternatives the democrats are attempting to push through congress are an incoherent mish mash one dubbed use it or lose it would oblige oil firms to exploit their existing leases more quickly or see them revert to the government the hitch is that federal leases already work along those lines and few imagine that oil firms are deliberately ignoring vast pools of oil given the current high price
3077990 another proposal involves revoking a tax break for oil firms with the proceeds going to fund research into alternative energy mr obama in a similar vein wants to impose a windfall tax on oil firms profits and use the proceeds to give all taxpayers a 1 000 energy rebate

3078006 we continue to believe that united can restore its place among the leaders in the airline industry and we continue to urge all united pilots to work to bring about that goal

3078103 i think we are seeing an upturn in uighur militancy
3078104 this series of attacks on monday is unprecedented in terms of its organisation it is an incredible act of defiance during the olympics a moment most precious to the government when they most want to avoid any kind of trouble or separatist violence

3078158 healthcare companies that recognize and calculate the true value of information will have the greatest likelihood of launching new products faster differentiating themselves from competitors and positioning themselves for long term success in a consumer focused healthcare market
3078159 the sticking point however is that better information differs from end user to end user rich clinical data wont have the same value for a health insurer that it will for a physicians practice
3078160 consider the information needed by a patient or physician about a particular disease
3078161 each constituent requires a different view of the dataset but if their needs dont match the available data feeds initiatives that promote transparency will be inefficient and unnecessarily costly
3078162 organizations must answer several fundamental questions when defining a strategy to compete in the healthcare informatics arena
3078163 but above all companies that become part of this new breed of healthcare organization will align the current effectiveness of payer and provider healthcare informatics with the development of new competencies that will increase the value of a companys information assets

3078170 ned would be so pleased that these talented students have a fellowship in his name
3078171 the acquisition of us salt accomplishes a lot for our investors on several fronts
3078172 first the salt business is characterized by stable cash flows and long term growth potential and it meets all of our strict acquisition criteria this transaction also provides us with a long term pipeline of high return storage development projects in the heart of the northeast natural gas distribution infrastructure in addition this transaction is yet another example of the successful execution on our plan to build an integrated natural gas storage and transportation hub in the northeast
3078173 one of the major hurdles with the development of salt cavern storage in the northeast is brine disposal this acquisition provides us a continuous means of brine disposal with limitless expansion possibilities to our overall energy storage platform in the northeast
3078174 the acquisition provides us with approximately 10 bcf of existing cavern space and every new brine well that we drill creates additional storage capacity

3078186 we believe that picis continues to be the system of choice for hospitals that want to automate their entire perioperative suite
3078187 todays operating room is expected to be the most efficient and highest revenue producing department of the hospital yet it is also where patient safety is at highest risk the leading health systems cannot afford to compromise with systems that do just the basics the environment today is too demanding and thats why more health providers choose picis than any other system
3078188 the olympic games provide a great platform to demonstrate the coca cola systems commitment to sustainability and help raise global awareness about the importance of environmental stewardship

3078200 it could take two weeks before we got back to sales with a definitive answer on what upgrades would be needed to support the new customer with an acceptable level of redundancy
3078201 my group was the slowest to respond in the rfp process because we had to be absolutely sure we werent making a mistake that would cost us money later
3078202 we realized traffic explorer could actually show us what failures would mean in the network
3078203 i could go through and virtually break different links and devices and know immediately the ramifications for customer traffic
3078204 we simply took an existing customer in the same geographic area and multiplied their traffic to what the new customer wanted that told us when wed have to upgrade pieces of the backbone based on their bandwidth demands traffic explorer even showed us where that customers servers should reside if we had put them at one data center we would have had to upgrade both the backbone and the peering at a different data center we could upgrade only the peering a cost difference of about 2 million
3078205 i had the sense it would be more efficient to disperse some of the peering strategically in other locations
3078206 so with traffic explorer we virtually placed the peering and transit connections in different locations ran various scaling and failure scenarios saw the impact on traffic and calculated the cost in a couple of days our assumptions were validated and we added the peering in utah
3078207 each day i get an email telling me what route flaps and route prefix changes occurred on the previous day
3078208 if there was a lot of activity outside the norm we want to know the reason was it a circuit issue did a specific customer cause it traffic explorer can tell us
3078209 we were immediately impressed with makovskys enthusiastic well rounded team and deep experience in our space
3078210 their understanding of our business and the ability to ramp up quickly and allocate top resources across the u s to drive our strategy was critical in our decision
3078211 globalization and demographic shifts have set off a worldwide hunt for the right c suite talent to lead companies to the next level
3078212 the companies that succeed will be determined by the advisors at their side and russell reynolds associates has long distinguished itself as an indispensable ally in that cause makovsky is pleased to partner with russell reynolds associates in this effort and looks forward to advancing the firms reputation and business development in the years to come
3078213 this group will do well on the evp exam they have years of evm experience have studied well and did well on our evprep tm sample exam questions
3078214 the earned value professional certification training class taught by ray stratton of management technologies provided valuable knowledge and insight for the students preparing for the evp certification exam the earned value management system refresher training and sample test questions were excellent training material
3078215 we spent considerable time on exam part four the written memorandum portion of the exam it seems to be the most challenging part for examinees
3078216 we chose radiant systems as our technology provider because of the companys proven track record supporting large global franchisees like the athletes foot
3078217 radiant systems also delivers an integrated inventory control and retail point of sale pos solution that is ideal for shoebox new york our high end boutique brand that carries an exclusive selection of the worlds most coveted designer lines
3078218 counterpoint is an ideal solution for nexcens retail franchisee locations because its an intuitive application that new employees are able to learn and understand quickly
3078219 this is especially important in retail environments where the addition of seasonal employees results in many new users on the system
3078220 with our offerings nexcens corporate team receives broad visibility into the overall business results of each store while each franchisees data remains secure and inaccessible by others in the franchise community
3078221 we identified yes to carrots as an exciting category innovator last year and were pleased when subsequently both investment firms retained us to advise them on the transaction
3078222 our industry expertise and relationships with the worlds leading masstige and prestige beauty retailers allowed us to fine tune projections for the companys multi channel distribution strategy
3078223 this gives people who routinely log in to gmail beginning with an https session a false sense of security because they think theyre secure but theyre really not
3078224 the longer we fail to act the more painful and limited our choices will be
3078225 i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world
3078226 actually we dont disagree as much as youd think i think people assume im a democrat but im registered independent and im still undecided so im looking at mccain as well as obama
3078227 weve got five kennedys here who have truly been inspiring public leaders and public servants to the people of cape cod
3078228 in light of the senators many accomplishments and in recognition of the public service contributions of the entire kennedy family to the people of our country and especially our neighbors on cape cod i propose we honor the family by renaming the ship
3078229 you can have a merchant marine with first class men even if they sail second class ships but second class men cannot be trusted with the finest ships afloat
3078230 he lives nearby and our cadets frequently serve as boat boys aboard his yacht
3078231 we use our training ship to give them practical experience
3078232 if you havent lived aboard a ship its hard to explain the attraction and allegiance thats formed
3078233 senator kennedy has always been inspired by the exceptional students of mass maritime and their service on the sea
3078234 he looks forward to continuing his strong relationship with the academy its faculty and students
3078235 first class men even if they sail second class ships
3078236 there were cars passing through the puddle so i figured i was ok but when i realized i wasnt going to make it i went in reverse
3078237 there was a car behind me and i stalled out
3078238 if we get through the next 24 hours we should be ok
3078239 but we are not getting out of the woods any time soon
3078240 due to a complaint being filed an investigation was initiated by internal affairs
3078241 in this case the officer is being allowed to work pending the outcome of the investigation
3078242 the whole town in the past three years has suffered immeasurably
3078243 no words that can explain how much devastation and loss this town has acquired
3078244 youve lived in this home for so many years and now its nothing
3078245 we dont have the equipment to do it and we dont have the money to pay someone to do it
3078246 id like to think that people were willing to sacrifice for the good of the town how can you not pay for basic services
3078247 some people dont know how theyre going to pay for heat this winter
3078248 its tough when you have to prioritize among things that are all important
3078249 you just keep going and hope there arent any more disasters
3078250 we try not only to educate but to entertain so were always looking for things that will be eye catchers
3078251 tourists like the dolls and the signature of john hancock things they might quickly recognize while europeans are looking at church history and researchers at the original manuscripts and journals people want to see the wealth of what we have
3078252 the exhibit is just to promote awareness of the history of the diocese that the archdiocese has been around for 200 years and catholicism for longer
3078253 with the rate of employment growth expected to remain below that of the working age population the unemployment rate is expected to rise
3078254 the good news is that it prevents some of the most abusive gift giving
3078255 if i didnt feel that it was beyond a half a loaf of victory i would not have signed on
3078256 we have to make sure that people have access to high quality care and that we are being efficient in the way we pay for that care and that we are paying for the right things
3078257 puts the challenge to those of us who have to implement it to do more planning
3078258 i commend the governor for standing firmly on the side of the patient and the taxpayer
3078259 governor patricks decision to sign the limit on gift giving is deeply disappointing and very likely damaging for medical partnerships clinical research and patients in massachusetts
3078260 we dont want to get into moral issues at this point
3078261 we are bringing them here to talk about the election and to talk about elizabeths battle with cancer and that to us was more than enough to captivate an audience
3078262 hes a public figure so he needs to give us more information about the case
3078263 i dont think that his personal life should be anyone elses business hopefully no one brings it up because his wife is going to be there and its going to be uncomfortable for her
3078264 i knew about the salem witch trials because i have identified with those witches a time or two
3078265 i think the question goes more to the speaker than to the college
3078266 the college booked senator edwards because hes high profile it didnt book him based on his moral standing
3078267 wir sind aber nicht die einzigen unsere tochter f hrt nur das versicherungskonsortium an

3078273 der kaukasus gewinnt f r sterreichs firmen immer mehr an bedeutung
3078274 i was lucky i got my children out 15 minutes before the bombs fell
3078275 i dont know whos to blame for this war the only thing i know is that it isnt me
3078276 it was 5am we saw the planes loop over the forest they then released their rockets there was a huge cloud of dust
3078277 we didnt know where the bombers were going to hit
3078278 we lived on the fifth floor we fled just before the attack started
3078279 she and her husband were both killed i dont know what happened to their seven year old boy
3078280 if europe and the us dont stop russia in 20 years time youll see a new wall going up in berlin
3078281 russia wants to get back its empire today they kill us and my family tomorrow they will kill you
3078282 if we say to russia ok have two bits of georgia then georgias independence will be finished he said
3078283 russia is completely to blame georgia is an independent sovereign country they are just trying to grab our land
3078284 why is the world not doing anything russia is using the same excuse of protecting its citizens that hitler used in 1939
3078285 russian bombers woke us at 4 50am this morning we ran out into the street to see what the noise was we were looking into the sky wondering where the bombs would fall
3078286 les clients ayant d j achet la premi re version de liphone et ayant souscrit un forfait orange b n ficieront dune offre pr f rentielle 99 euros via une offre de remboursement pour d couvrir la version 3g
3078287 ive got it i accept that and im going to beat it
3078288 no question in my mind im not worried about this affecting the rest of my life
3078289 we are not alone and we know what we need to say from our websites and laptops the street corners and coffeehouses the delis and diners the factory floors and the bookstores on campus at the mall the synagogue sanctuary and mosque lets tell it where we can when we can and while we still can
3078290 there has not been adequate planning for the increased traffic and parking issues worse the only way this operation will work is if they expand as is the intent for the near future
3078291 any solution to the these problems will inevitably cost taxpayers too much down the road
3078292 turning invaluable publicly owned park land into commercial use property without regard to the intent of the citys zoning laws should give everyone pause its an invitation to chaos and questionable precident
3078293 if this is the way the city is willing to treat such a bequest who will ever be willing to make such a gift to the city again
3078294 this community has invested to a large extent in the development of this park and river walk the investment must be protected and in keeping with the original design the commercialization of this park violates the publics trust
3078295 but at a time of competing city budget priorities to put over 200 000 in capital improvements into a commercial baseball park that is not even supposed to be there is silly
3078296 the g7 ministers called on russia to accept an immediate cease fire they expressed deep concern for the civilian casualties and continued attacks on civilian locations
3078297 the governors office estimates the 4 million system would raise 40 million to hire 500 more troopers the new officers could be used to create 10 teams that would target high crime areas throughout the state the governors office says
3078298 the g7 ministers called on russia to accept an immediate cease fire they expressed deep concern for the civilian casualties and continued attacks on civilian locations
3078299 the note came back i can still see it actually the note came back to me with the words crossed like slashed through it
3078300 regrettably that was an error in judgment on my part
3078301 weve worked very closely with industry to garner as much input with respect to what is operationally feasible
3078302 the lobbyists running his low road campaign the money billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies but almost nothing for families like yours lurching to the right then the left the old washington dance whatever it takes john mccain a washington celebrity playing the same old washington games
3078303 die einzige standortgarantie ist eine aua die gewinne schreibt das kann sie nur mit einem partner
3078304 given the importance of vision to a pathologist the college may wish to consider whether or not this represents an ethical and or legal failure to disclose a significant medical problem
3078305 i wish to sincerely apologize to any patient if i have made an error in reading their pathology slides i was not aware of any errors in my work
3078306 but that is like blackmail for me that is not professional medicine
3078307 as far as i was concerned it was the administration
3078308 he wanted my job and i didnt want to give it
3078309 zumindest kurzfristig ist der t gliche arbeitsweg was den preis betrifft kaum elastisch
3078310 bleibt das preisniveau etwa f r treibstoffe ber jahre hoch wird traditionell verst rkt ber alternativen nachgedacht
3078311 ber einen zeitraum von mehreren jahren kann es sich schon auszahlen ernsthaft ber einen wechsel des wohnorts im sinne k rzerer wege zum arbeitsplatz nachzudenken
3078312 anders als beim weg zur arbeit d rften autofahrer beim freizeitverkehr doch etwas sensibler auf die gestiegenen kosten reagieren
3078313 were not dealing here with a case of one isolated incident in an otherwise unblemished career
3078314 the senates failure to pass the mining law would leave citizens virtually powerless to protect drinking water
3078315 sometimes the birth of a child is not a blessing it is often a burden
3078316 medical science has made it possible for families to limit the number of children they have and in this country the vast majority of them do the fact that she now treasures her unplanned child is irrelevant it is relevant that she has to feed clothe and educate her
3078317 in the view of many canadian nurses the restructuring of hospitals and downsizing of the nursing workforce that has taken place since the early 1990s has had a major impact on the quality of patient care
3078318 it is hoped that this research will inform initiatives aimed at reducing risks to patient safety in canadian hospitals
3078319 i just want the damn fence built ill let the libs and the intellectuals sit around and worry about irony
3078320 i was simply acknowledging that in the construction industry a pretty significant percentage of workers are obviously undocumented

3078331 we are expecting john rood to visit on august 13 15
3078332 but the visit is not 100 percent sure due to unknown developments in georgia for example
3078333 i have been taking part in talks between tusk and his top aides and i had the impression that the political interest had priority over the countrys security
3078334 the period of rapid housing price appreciation in the unece region appears to have ended and could be followed by a period of reduced construction and a lower demand for wood products

3078342 theyve been through some very difficult political times the cultural revolution for one where the leadership actually created violent anarchy and society turned on itself all i can tell you is is that its important for the united states to be active in this part of the world with all countries and to stay engaged with china
3078343 and he listened politely i cant read his mind but i do know that every time i met with him i pressed the point
3078344 it is regrettable that some companies and individuals resort to such tactics
3078345 we have worked for 22 years to develop asigra software with innovation quality service and honesty we are committed to aggressively defending asigras brand and reputation and its leading position in the backup and recovery industry
3078346 before using deadline managing our render farm was a real thorn in my side ive since become a total deadline evangelist and sing its praises to the heavens because it just works we never have to worry about what we push through the render farm i leave it running overnight and when i look at the logs in the morning id see that deadline was doing a massive amount of behind the scenes housekeeping deadline is simply brilliant
3078347 our growing list of customers and testimonials is proof that deadline is addressing the needs of vfx studios regardless of size were constantly hearing about deadlines reliability ease of integration and use and how it gives facilities peace of mind because deadline enables them to get the job done on time
3078348 it is a great joy to build a car and know exactly how much fun customers will have with it
3078349 pitching at half speed for the next 10 starts is not what were looking for either if we act now this will be just a little while

3078356 consequently he has had two hip operations given it away and gone fishing meanwhile im still out here
3078357 he was a character he handed me a broom and wanted to watch me sweep
3078358 i told him i wanted to learn golf i didnt come for housework training but he wanted to see my movements
3078359 she the farmer was on her own in the dark and no one stopped to help
3078360 they would probably say its not my job but you would think someone would have stopped to help her
3078361 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3078362 weve been using krakatoa for about a year on a variety of commercial and feature film projects and even participated in the softwares original beta test
3078363 today krakatoa is an essential component of our cg pipeline its interface is very intuitive its surprisingly easy to learn and boasts an impressive feature set there are tools that manage particle count balance how particles are loaded and displayed and handle particle culling where and when you need it krakatoas like a swiss army knife loaded with all sorts of useful gadgets that you might not use straight away but when you need them they do the job brilliantly
3078364 throughout this whole process including an intensive initial r amp d phase the frantic films software support team was phenomenal they provided numerous helpful suggestions very early on that guided our vfx crew on how to wrangle the terabytes of lidar data that would be on our plate and if there was ever an issue with the software the problem was solved by tech support in a timely manner if not right away
3078365 krakatoa has superb integration with other particle plugins its really an integral part of our cg pipeline now as we havent come across another tool that can do what krakatoa does
3078366 ambrics architecture will enable us to achieve levels of performance we simply could not realize with our former solution

3078371 weve been running a deficit for a long time and to make these kinds of cuts is really the only avenue weve got to make any significant leeway in our budget
3078372 their argument is that no other state agency has day care facilities provided for staff

3078386 unfortunately that never happened most of the peacemongers and friends of palestine are western ashkenazi the eastern jews supported the right wing that support has become an obstacle against achieving peace as the radical right wing always get the eastern jewrys vote
3078387 i can understand their hesitation as in the beginning they had to prove to the european ashkenazis their loyalty and enthusiasm for the country and their complete detachment from their original arab countries however it has been 60 years since the establishment of
3078388 there is no one now in israel that doubts their loyalty in fact they are more zealous than the ashkenazis it is time for them to speak up about reality and the need for a dialogue with the arabs based on justice fairness and the admission of mistakes on both parts they need to do that for israels future and the future of their children and the children of all the inhabitants of the region

3078422 this is something that we immediately asked to be done last week realizing that these could be offensive
3078423 for all the talk about the private sector taking off in iraq it didnt materialize
3078424 people would say well these people are poor we need to help them its true but we didnt create jobs i think this is a huge problem

3078445 up to now u s export activity has been able to keep u s gdp positive but if exports slow in conjunction with the housing slump and a pull back in consumer spending the next 12 months could see additional slowing

3078451 i recommend looking beyond your selling expenses especially given the yield on both options 1 and 2 are the same in my opinion the bottom line depends on the property being offered at the right price based on a thorough comparative market analysis rather than math related to selling expenses
3078452 my suggestion is to try for the second scenario also the commission split is important too perhaps offer the sales agent a half a percent more it excites agents to show your home if they know they are getting an inch more commission than the rest of the co op fees are paying in your area lastly if you get an offer in that seems low you can alway go back and re negoitate the commission if you feel it necessary perhaps even put that in the listing agreement
3078453 agent 2 will have much more money for advertising which they will need in this maket but have them price it at 399 900 just make sure your price is the same as others like it otherwise it really wont matter honestly buyers looking at 392 will also be looking at 400 so let them make an offer
3078454 what are they going to do for you how are they going to get the job done what is not only their marketing strategy but their understanding and use of the internet how will they work communicate and interact with the likely savvy and informed consumer in that price range that will purchase your home

3078470 we believe that the social norms marketing campaign has really had a fairly dramatic impact on the students at our university
3078471 as a clinician what i find so interesting about social norms marketing is that it shares many of the principles that we use in motivational counseling when we see an individual in a clinical setting it creates a discrepancy between what the patient may be doing or believing and what is actually the norm it presents the information in a very respectful and objective way that enable an individual to make a healthier decision

3078496 as far as his overall display was concerned he has carried on he was terrific for us last year
3078497 it was a case of regrouping and recovering psychologically as much as anything
3078498 we had worked so hard during pre season we came into the game feeling very good about ourselves
3078499 i think our season started at a quarter past three that was the first time we made a pass i think

3078541 even before the first grape was picked while the project was still in the planning stages our goal was always to produce true high quality wines that would appeal to those who appreciate the finer things in life
3078542 the wines are very limited in production we will continue to make only about 250 cases of each varietal each year we believe we have reached our goal of quality and balance by combining the talents of joe briggs and by sourcing grapes from some of the finest vineyards in napa and sonoma counties
3078543 we aim to launch our new compact vehicles at 800 things gone wrong per 1 000 vehicles

3078552 with declining sales and fewer customers dealers need to find ways to grow their service customer pay repair business traditionally dealers have used vehicle inspections processes to identify additional sales opportunities the problem with inspection processes in most dealerships is a lack of discipline to adhere to a standard inspection process and the inability to effectively manage or implement change in this process
3078553 ive been in the business 16 years and this is the first time ive ever seen a system where you give a customer a piece of information that is worth something to them they say anything printed off a computer is real well i guess the proof is in the pudding our upsell per 30 day return is tremendous we see almost 2 000 a day in return revenue from vehicles inspected 30 days ago
3078554 the world class inspection program is wonderful because it allows our customers to know exactly what their vehicle needs when they leave before we were in the archaic days like cave men scribbling things on the back of repair orders we would just give it to our customers and say well here you need a thousand dollars worth of repair with no explanation of how and why we got there
3078555 with vehicle sales off and brand loyalty disintegrating procuring more customers is no longer the answer for improving service and parts profits selling all the legitimately needed work to your existing customers is the key and mpi has found that dealers who use their world class inspection tm product are realizing an additional 100 a repair order in customer pay sales this is the difference between staying in business or not for many dealers

3078632 who else knows more about the facility than he does he was working here when they built most of it
3078633 in the early days there werent a lot of people here those that were did a lot of different jobs when i started i think there were 35 employees three of us herb anderson kenny lupe and myself used to design improvements and come up with model changes for the airplanes on nights and weekends once we had something we thought would work wed bring in the draftsmen and have them draw it up and then wed build it and certify it

3078637 ive never regretted staying at mooney the whole time its pretty much a family here and i hear people on my tours comment all the time on how people here have such a great attitude we take a lot of pride in our work because there is so much handwork on our airplanes that requires personal attention and its wonderful to work with so many individuals who can look at the airplanes we turn out and be proud that our products have such a great reputation mooneys have the strongest metal cabin structure and wing in the industry and thats a direct result of the attention that weve paid to our work when i consider the people and all ive experienced i dont see any reason to retire
3078638 im doing something i really enjoy so why should i quit doing it i have no desire to retire i certainly cant sit around and watch television all day

3078699 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me

3078711 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother

3078719 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

3078773 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones

3078806 another interesting aspect is seeing how certain countries are what i call cyber locked
3078807 we know a land locked country has no access to the sea
3078808 i managed the money ran the studio and contacted galleries critics and collectors
3078809 my job was to have everything prepared so that it was easier for bob to paint
3078810 i first met the de menils houston area art collectors and museum founders when i was working for bob and they eventually started collecting my work
3078811 your work is going to look similar to theirs at some point but i often tell artists to work through that to get to the other side if you can do that it shows your strength of character as an artist
3078812 its very hard to focus on your own work when you spend a lot of time working for someone else
3078813 its like any job the more time you devote to one task the less time you have for others
3078814 one of the problems with emergencies is that you dont know what anyone else is doing
3078815 you dont want artists left out in the cold because everyone thinks some other foundation is taking care of them and it doesnt make sense for an artist to get 10 grants from 10 different agencies
3078816 we also found that many of the organizations on the ground in louisiana and mississippi had either suffered direct hits or had staff members who were displaced and thus unable to deliver assistance
3078817 now when i have an idea or inspiration i dont need to rent a shop or wait to get invited by a publisher or university to do a print edition
3078818 im on my own turf and i can control the process more
3078819 many artists want to make prints in their own studios rather than traveling somewhere to do it
3078820 and i got tired of moving 1 800 pound presses through windows and doors
3078821 we redesigned our presses a few years ago to be smaller more stable and economical suitable for someones home
3078822 artists in the educational market are interested in safety and durability for multiple use instances such as with students who have never done printmaking before
3078823 lightweight design and portability are also concerns in the educational market where presses may only be used a couple of times a week
3078824 outside of the workshop many of them are caregivers or work in a field that has nothing to do with art they need to narrow their focus warm up the eye to whats in front of them and get the clutter out of their minds
3078825 i find that people get hung up if they draw something and it doesnt come out looking like the object
3078826 if theyre not worried about making a carbon copy of that object on the paper they can let go of their fear of drawing
3078827 i tell people that it doesnt have to look like something and be ready to sell
3078828 it quickly gets students into the creative side of their brains
3078829 i just have a harder time getting them into the painting mode
3078830 before i do any major painting i do many playful goofing around warm ups with my acrylic like paint sketching
3078831 its all about communication i do at least six one minute warm up paintings in my studio every morning before i jump into a full sheet of watercolor paper or large canvas my warm up method is meant to be pure play getting ready for more serious efforts for galleries and festivals it seems to me that too many artists stop thinking of art as fun
3078832 to enable them to see how the composition will look
3078833 i think its important to get the design down first so that when im painting i can concentrate on the color and interpretation
3078834 i have the reputation of being pretty loyal to my artists regardless of whether they sell or not
3078835 but as time went on i found myself overextended and i had to cut back
3078836 for us in geneva its much easier to sell a work when the artist has a strong gallery in new york
3078837 sometimes artists have too many commitments and cant produce enough work
3078838 i knew sales at those galleries would hold me over until i got another one in new york
3078839 when i reject an artist its generally because the artist and the gallery arent a good fit
3078840 in a weird way getting 100 rejection letters is a good thing
3078841 because it means im putting my work out there for people to see
3078842 i do get a little depressed when i receive a rejection letter from a gallery that i really liked or a show that i really wanted to get into but i just file it and try to figure out what to do next
3078843 its important for all of us to deal with rejection and ive learned that it isnt necessarily personal or serious its not even a big deal its just part of the process
3078844 they give me pointers for when i apply next year
3078845 so many of them are photocopies with a checked yes or no box on it
3078846 its ok i have two just like him at home
3078847 the lower back was the most challenging the tones are very subtle in that area
3078848 every stroke had to be laid down much more carefully
3078849 they had stopped having dissection classes when i was there so i saw
3078850 while i was sketching at the exhibit i also drew the internal organs those parts influence the external forms so you have to know about them too
3078851 i felt that because ive studied anatomy books attended dissections and studied form i could draw what i saw and not just copy every little detail
3078852 i could push the drawing so that i was able to put myself into it and add what i was seeing
3078853 also it showed a lot of interesting anatomy in the front
3078854 its a way to explore my ideas much more quickly than with sculpture
3078855 i sketched at bodies seven or eight times and this was one of my favorites i loved how delicate the central nervous system looked
3078856 i was at one sketch night where it seemed like it was just me and the security guards the lights were all out and it was a little creepy but i liked it i could set up my tripod easel and go to work
3078857 im very interested in anatomy and the way the body works and im eager to go back to the anatomy lab this august and draw the cadaver when its fresh
3078858 i tried desperately to put the concept of shading into the linocut which was very difficult
3078859 but i discovered that unlike in a drawing i was able to get tremendous movement of lines around each element in the subject bones could curve around sockets and if i leaned into the tool i could put that feeling into it
3078860 it seemed like i just knew where each line was supposed to go
3078861 i noticed that the hand was taking on more of a galleon look with foremast mizzenmast mainmast and boom at the front that was totally suitable for the seaport and all the history and amazing maritime activity that used to go on down there in the 18th century
3078862 its always been a great source of inspiration for me the natural the human body
3078863 i did sketches on site and then started playing with the images in my studio
3078864 the way some of the forms looked reminded me of pieces of wood and i found that very interesting this was the only specimen that was cut horizontally so you could see the multiple layers see whats going on inside and outside the inside of the muscle structure reminded me of roots the way the muscles were stringy and tapering
3078865 theres a lot of speculation about where these bodies come from and its definitely a political show very loaded
3078866 but for me its a celebration of the form i think the human body is really amazing and i wanted to make something a little more optimistic sometimes the human form can be a bit frightening when its been stripped like that but ive never thought of it as being horrific in any way
3078867 it was the only full size female i saw and being female i was drawn to this body because i could relate
3078868 i made some changes to it to make it more me this is what i call an alternate reality self portrait i elongated the figure as it was a pretty short body and im tall i essentially used the figure as the basis for a large drawing
3078869 the gesso doesnt completely cover the charcoal and i leave it like that
3078870 i dont adhere to just the rendering of the subject but rather instill some emotion into a piece this is evident even in the way i choose to use the materials i rough up lines and put gesso on it using brushstrokes as much as possible its not just the imagery thats important but how you use the materials

3078879 i work on oil primed linen so the fat to lean qualities of the paint to surface are an integral part of the painting process
3078880 they are malleable and working wet into wet creates fluidity to the brushstrokes one can also paint an area to prepare it for further detail at a later time during a painting session although the oil will have had a chance to dry a bit the area will still accept new paint and details beautifully and the additions will appear seamlessly integrated
3078881 after many years of using transparent watercolor i started working with water soluble oil
3078882 my husband was ill at the time and i didnt want to use solvents that might bother him i had painted with solvent based oil many years before and enjoyed them but given the circumstances using water soluble oil seemed like the best way for me to get back into working with a thicker more opaque paint
3078883 it makes more sense to me as a plein air painter and its safer for the environment
3078884 i was told early on that they take the same time to dry as traditional oils but i have not found this to be the case my paintings are dry to the touch in one or two days
3078885 if i am on site or it is a particularly windy or dry day they can dry before i pack up this can sometimes be a challenge if i want to tweak my painting back in the studio
3078886 i can discard my water on location or down the drain without hurting the environment making clean up both easy and practical
3078887 i first started working with alkyds more than 20 years ago
3078888 i decided to use them for a painting trip to the southwest since they dry rapidly making it easy to transport the paintings home i simply put a sheet of wax paper between the paintings taped them in a bundle and put them in the suitcase
3078889 my first monochrome layers can contain almost 50 percent alkyd which allows me to work on a dry painting the next morning
3078890 later on in the work i can control the drying time by adjusting the amounts of alkyd and oil with each color
3078891 in the end however you use it acrylic still retains a somewhat plastic look
3078892 the color just looks richer and more splendid in oil when alkyd came along i realized that i could get the best of both worlds the fast drying i needed to build thin layers quickly and the richness of oil by working them both together i can get the exact combination of properties that i need
3078893 i sometimes switch to gamblin oil paints for the final layer of a painting because they have greater brilliance than the alkyds
3078894 i also like to lay down a layer of galkyd gamblins alkyd oil painting medium and work into that it assures that the fastest drying layer is on bottom

3078973 at the same time that the american taxpayer was being asked to bail these companies out barney frank the chairman of the financial services committee instituted a sort of tax on freddie and fannie and that tax goes into whats called an affordable housing trust fund its a really a taxpayer subsidized housing fund but that money will go to organizations like la raza and acorn
3078974 hey theres washington dc to the north with 3 major airports and even norfolk to our east why would an air carrier choose richmond
3078975 because i have fallen in love with so many pretty girls and never once the least bit with any man
3078976 ignited the war in darfur and turned it from conflict between tribes into conflict against the state and they have sent cadres to manage the war
3078977 we did not flirt the peoples congress the pcp is no longer considered by the movement as islamic issue that merits to stop on or to lend it a hand to return or to unite with them
3078978 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
3078979 the the partition on the flash drive with encrypted data was completely inaccessible without the correct password
3078980 deep shows always finish late so my fight is going to be late anyways probably around 22 30 so i am doing my work out session at 22 30
3078981 our members have changed so let me introduce the new members
3078982 and mic here is the lead guitar in los angeles no one is better than mic this t shirt we are wearing today its pimpit the best apparel maker this guy mic discovered in los angeles
3078983 before the fight theses guys will intimidate him with a great performance so from the moment of the walk in to the ring i am already winning the fight
3078984 well i guess there is a difference in gravity so i guess i will give him a break
3078985 i dont understand any of it i cant even engage in a conversation with that guy
3078986 right now at deeps featherweight 145 dokonjonosuke mishima is the strongest but if dj can be involved in this mix its going to be very interesting
3078987 some people are changing their way of interacting with their pets and are beginning to treat them like family
3078988 originally sean was only hosting stray dogs in his own apartment in taipei until he got evicted from his residence
3078989 originally a guy named eric started the shelter with me but he quit after a month while 10 people showed up for the first monthly organization meeting all of them quit within weeks
3078990 we pull in about nt 200 000 a month which just breaks us even since our basic expenditures including salary for three local full time staff and rent is around nt 160 000 per month depending on the number of animals in the shelter we also need nt 20 000 to nt 30 000 for food
3078991 unlike some animal shelters we dont kill our animals except on very rare occasions
3078992 lazarus the name of a man in the bible who was raised from the dead by jesus was a complete mess when we found him you can see pictures of him on our web site animalstaiwan org rescues htm but by the time he got out and found an owner he was happy energetic and loving
3078993 even for animals that are blind or have only two legs as long as there is life in their eyes we would give them a try because it is not our job to take away their desire to live we have always been amazed by their recoveries
3078994 some people too freely dump their dogs because the puppies turned into dogs and are not cute anymore or because their pets behave badly or because it is not convenient for them to keep dogs anymore
3078995 which is just like dumping dogs out of the owners own stupidity and ignorance because no dog would behave without proper training and training them is the responsibility of the owners
3078996 you dont see caged animals as much some people are changing their way of interacting with their pets and are beginning to treat them like family if anything some people are starting to baby their dogs which may not necessarily be a good thing if it is too extreme
3078997 there is always going to be stray or mistreated dogs
3078998 one of future key focuses of at will be to run an educational program that teaches the public compassion for animals as well as how to care for and train them
3078999 as an ngo we can now apply for governmental funding receive money from international charities as well as get corporate sponsorship
3079000 i have always liked and felt dedicated to animals and i want to see a change in taiwan
3079001 whenever you feel like quitting it is a test of whether you are going to succeed in your pursuit or not those that give up do not succeed
3079002 women then showed that they are a power to be reckoned with and that if united women can achieve results
3079003 it is unfair that taiwanese women are not included in the convention but they should not be paralyzed by the politics
3079004 no vivimos para morir vivimos para vivir pero lo que pasa es que nos morimos
3079005 brightness outside darkened moods inside as streetlights flood homes some in d c will do anything to take back the night
3079006 exalted the humble shoemaker to the rank of kings adviser

3079008 did you say new edition oh new addition for a second i thought you were talking about the r amp b group earth to drew open your ears
3079009 our bodies are designed to deal with stress intermittently not 24 hours a day
3079010 removing the source of stress even for a short time allows your body to recover restore and relax
3079011 and that may mean going out to lunch and not telling anyone where you go
3079012 viewing pictures of a restful scene allows you to recapture the feelings associated with the image
3079013 but the benefit of boring your friends and neighbors is that youre more likely to retain the experience yourself
3079014 the natural rhythm of the waves ebb and flow helps slow the mind and relax the body
3079015 deep breaths stretch out muscles in your chest and diaphragm and alert your mind that youre ready to relax
3079016 one important aspect is a request to teachers and alumni to recommend students for inclusion although this is not required recommended students get letters saying they have been nominated with a quote from president clinton about the student ambassador program
3079017 high school students recommended by the principal or a teacher who are capable of properly representing and speaking for our country abroad thus becoming ambassadors will be carefully selected through a written application health examination certificate and personal screening interviews to qualify you must have a good school record and interest in people and international affairs
3079018 to have a satisfactory record an entity must operate for at least 12 months properly and promptly address matters referred to it by the bbb and be free from an unusual volume or pattern of complaints and law enforcement action invovling its marketplace conduct in addition the bbb must have a clear understanding of the companys business and no concerns about its industry
3079019 the potential for further cooperation between the two countries is huge
3079020 i asked to come here because i thought it would be the right moment to be in taiwan
3079021 it was just some months ahead of the legislative and the presidential elections the mood was already that the taiwanese political scene was about to have some historic changes but what we could not have imagined was the dimension of the change
3079022 it was the voters that wanted the change and they got it
3079023 at the time i could not have imagined that i would come back to taiwan as the representative
3079024 we dont believe there will be any problem as it is only a private visit
3079025 fighting corruption and advocating clean government is the global trend and the administrations top priority
3079026 there is nothing wrong with a civil servant living a simple life

3079028 former florida franchisee cecil rolle has become more nettlesome to cold stone than most after the company terminated him last year it alleged in a florida circuit court action that he had been caught removing equipment from one of his three florida stores in the middle of the night
3079029 i saw that picture of the arena online and i have got to go donw there to look at it and take a pic of it
3079030 next to bagel heads on the parkway and i can count 6 to 7 new major construction developments along that way thats pretty impressive especially during a slow economy that tallahassee is still able to move forward and progress
3079031 que lo vuelvan profesional que hagan con el equipo lo que quieran que por mi dios am rica nunca ser campe n
3079032 cuando me sacaron a patadas luego de haber servido tanto al equipo me fui a una cantina que llamaban el hoyo ubicada en la carrera 3 con calle 17 y en medio de mujeres de vida alegre me puse a tomar trago y proced a coger una botella de aguardiente la apret y la llev en las manos hasta la parte final de la espalda y uno a uno maldije a los jugadores y directivos del am rica la maldici n cay sobre el equipo porque nunca jam s pudo ser campe n
3079033 it was important for us to find a solution that was sophisticated and flexible enough to effectively handle our planning needs
3079034 efficiency was also of great importance as we sought to eliminate much of the manual processes inherent with our current planning application and leverage our resources for more productive data analysis
3079035 satori group was able to meet our aggressive implementation time line with a very streamlined approach we are ready for our current planning cycle and have an application that we will use throughout the year for re forecasting and modeling
3079036 im not sure i would have been able to handle him in any case today no doubt he has talent and hes been able to keep this up for five or six weeks
3079037 this was the best win of my career i beat tommy robredo last year but this is the ultimate
3079038 its been a good week considering that i was only hitting the ball again a week ago after not being able to move my neck im looking to improve and carry it forward next week in washington
3079039 i played a very good week and i played unbelievable today
3079040 i dont think andy was 100 percent but it is great to play and win here i can play relaxed with a lot of crowd support im happy with my game and my tournament
3079041 i think the rain this last day and a half helped but the first two days when we got here i was struggling with the pollution the heat the humidity
3079042 you could really feel it in your lungs when you started to breathe heavily
3079043 i did not think it was going to be like that i have yet to see blue sky or sun i thought maybe there was going to be a small smog layer in patches but its literally a haze
3079044 weve managed to adapt to the situation from home to china
3079045 there is some pollution but for me everything about the environment i just take it out i dont want an excuse i cant control the enviornment and the pollution i havent tried any different things like a mask because in the race you have to do the race without the mask
3079046 both teams were breathing the same air we were more concerned with the heat and humidity
3079047 the truth i didnt feel nothing from the pollution that didnt affect me the problem is the humidity i had to change the shirt every 10 minutes
3079048 when an artist takes the time to develop an archive of their work they demonstrate that they are serious about their art treat it with respect and act responsibly
3079049 picasso was a good businessman who kept meticulous records and marketed himself well robert motherwell was also scrupulous about tracking his paintings
3079050 there are american artists who kept careful logs of their work but who didnt document their locations
3079051 for example john george brown 1831 1913 didnt keep track of his paintings and today we dont know where his paintings are located american artists in the 21st century should organize their paintings in a sequential order the smithsonians archives of american art www aaa si edu shows the logs of american artists which are great for art historians who want to track a paintings existence or for contemporary artists who want to see how the work of past artists has been documented
3079052 i look at the clothing fashion furniture design the landscapes and building architecture all of which can indicate time periods and geographic locations of where the painting took place
3079053 i look at signatures within the context of the artists style
3079054 an artists signature can be as expressive and stylized as their artwork if their artwork is detailed their signature may have a lot of detail as well
3079055 identification of the paints based on the crystalline properties of the color samples reveals the pigments used to create the work and when the piece could first have been created
3079056 if we find that the materials were not available at the time the artist painted then the authenticity is questioned material science can only point to authenticity historical style and provenance are also essential components and signature analysis is of growing importance
3079057 although the smithsonians archives of american art does not take an official position or have any guidelines on the types of information artists might gather about themselves and their work
3079058 we certainly encourage them to preserve careful complete documentation of their work and career so they may be of benefit to scholars
3079059 artists arent librarians or accountants they may not pay attention to tracking details and it could be difficult to get them into the habit of record keeping
3079060 for this reason artists should select a tracking method that is as simple as possible
3079061 i like to use artists grade 140 lb or 300 lb cold pressed paper i find hot pressed paper is not as effective for layering and its rough texture impedes making detail
3079062 its my last week filling in for craig on the r3 30 and ive had a great time it all went by so fast but im happy craigs back because i miss him and he often springs for lunch on todays podcast im confronting a horrible addiction or compulsion or trivial idiosyncrasy im not even sure what it is but i guess i need help yes indeed more radio therapy for vish any way on this rock t shirt podcast of the r3 30 im hoping to finally rid myself of my one and only vice collecting and wearing music t shirts and keeping them forever its a lifestyle change that my mom and wife have long insisted i explore so they might just tune in broken social scene will drop by to discuss his t shirt collection i try to get a hold of to ask about rock n rolls fashionability i speak with mike chilton sent in a rock t shirt related request ill play a song that reflects the trouble caused by one of my own shirts i get to a familial long range request from uncle sam the wheel of freedom spins for lee in vancouver and of course this weeks top 30 phew its going to a jam packed sweat inducing show good thing i have plenty of shirts to change into speaking of which radio 3 has launched an online ongoing canadian museum of rock shirts just check out this flickr group and please become a member so you can upload photos of some of your favourite canadian music shirts and see everyone elses cmon do it itll be fun
3079063 and again i say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
3079064 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
3079065 for it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god

3079077 every process in our industrial world creates waste heat its energy that we just throw away
3079078 this venue is very important because we dont have enough of that
3079079 it is good to get back to the principles of what this festival is about people are going to see something they have never seen before
3079080 we have got a venue with a huge spectrum of performers
3079081 the good thing is that there is a huge family atmosphere here
3079082 for me it is what the festival is all about collaboration with different cultures communication sharing and enjoying each others cultures
3079083 we have 29 child performers from cambodia some incredible performers from brazil called the capoeira knights and a new show called hemmingways havana
3079084 together with old friends of mine the zawose family we have got something very special and unique
3079085 their father huckwe was a well known international musician who worked with peter gabriel and toured the world
3079086 he died five years ago but he had seven wives and more than 40 children who were all taught to learn and play his music
3079087 there is a great wealth and understanding of music and dance in their culture
3079088 after his death they did not know which direction to go in
3079089 its great to have a good run im pretty confident for the semi now
3079090 i paddled really well and i was shocked to be in 14th place after the first run
3079091 in the semi finals its a case of giving it your all but not doing anything silly its a balancing act as trying anything too risky will blow it
3079092 my first run didnt go to plan but i was much stronger the second time around
3079093 were knee deep in the studio in oakland ca recording our new album right now which is coincidentally directly accross the street from the club were playing at and will be playing this show as were finishing up the mixing
3079094 the internet is buzzing that a miley cyrus nick jonas sex tape of sorts is going to be made available for purchase soon
3079095 im happy to confirm to you that alessandra meyer w lden and boris becker were engaged yesterday with a small circle of family members
3079096 there was a domestic argument between the mother and father
3079097 he got upset and struck the mother in the face one or two times on the left cheek which caused some bruising from what im told he hit her with a closed fist
3079098 the mother called police shortly before 3 a m and mr panettiere was taken into custody
3079099 hes been cooperative earlier they were at a party and the husband apparently felt disrespected by his wife

3079102 our family has been through a lot some caused by nature some caused by human weakness but we have stood with one another through them all
3079103 its not that easy and people who think that you can make a split decision are really people who have never in my opinion personally experienced infidelity because there is no one size fits all solution when it comes to dealing with infidelity
3079104 youve been working for that dream for years and years
3079105 theyve made all kinds of compromises theyve got networks in the community children memories much more than the adultery
3079106 we saw it as a tool to help us with retention and recruitment
3079107 this definitely is something that has helped with our stature in the community and with our competitiveness
3079108 executives realize that if employees are stressed out financially have excess debt it really makes them less productive
3079109 theres a real financial benefit to the company a long term financial benefit for their employees to be on track for retirement and financially fit
3079110 if a company doesnt have a competitive 401 k program in place its going to be very difficult to compete for talent
3079111 we had to delay start dates because we physically didnt have a seat for new employees
3079112 we have a great commitment to quality that you dont always see in bigger companies

3079187 if it werent for inflation people wouldnt mess around with all the volatility in the stock market
3079188 inflation is a compelling reason why clients would want to have a stock exposure in their portfolio depending on their age
3079189 they would want to have at least 30 percent in stocks to help minimize the effects of inflation
3079190 what investors should be worried about is what are the future expectations for future earnings
3079191 if companies are faced with higher input costs and cant pass it on profits shrink
3079192 for investors in the equity markets they need to think about which companies can grow their businesses in such an environment
3079193 who has pricing power foreign exposure and the ability to grow a business in a declining u s economy
3079194 it eats away at the purchasing power of the portfolio and as the fed raises rates it also decreases the value of the bonds a double whammy
3079195 also we try to keep maturities short on bonds so as they mature we buy bonds at higher rates
3079196 i expect inflation to continue because the fed is under pressure to keep interest rates low to combat the credit crisis
3079197 the demise of the dollar and why its great for your investments
3079198 society is addicted to easy credit at the personal consumption and banking level
3079199 the natural tendency is to inflate the currency and we expect that to continue for some time
3079200 they help protect you against inflation but the best inflation hedge is gold
3079201 were in one of those moments in time when you want to be out of the stock market and in cash
3079202 but not dollars gold should be your liquidity gold is money historically it has maintained its value over long periods of time
3079203 home prices are declining at a substantial rate and thats a big asset on everyones balance sheet
3079204 wages are significantly embedded in corporate costs wage growth is not inflationary but minimal at best
3079205 we are in a recession and that will lead to a decline in other high cost items such as gas and groceries
3079206 those prices will come down in the next six months without the fed taking any further action on interest rates
3079207 we think the way to hedge portfolios from the effects of inflation is to invest in carefully selected stocks
3079208 stocks have historically since 1925 averaged about 10 percent a year and that beats inflation over that time period by 3 5 percent
3079209 in the short term stocks may be volatile but in the long term they should provide the inflation hedge
3079210 the emotion behind money building wealth from the inside out
3079211 are the only thing shown to outpace inflation in the last 100 years

3079226 to execute decisions of the ukrainian national security council on
3079227 these repressions will have the converse effect people will strive to get soyuz back to pick up orthodox broadcast through satellites and soyuz will have more actual analytical programs especially on situation in ukraine
3079228 information is the most important factor of our life thus the attempts to deprive millions of orthodox ukrainian citizens of their right on information are the direct persecutions of orthodoxy
3079229 its clear orthodox majority in ukraine doesnt want to listen to anti canonical anti church absurd about

3079231 russian troops are currently disarming the surrounded georgian forces in south ossetia
3079232 we have eliminated the possibility of an aerial threat from georgia in the georgian south ossetian conflict zone
3079233 we did not bomb georgias oil pipelines if we had done this oil spills and possible oil fires could have led to a regional environmental disaster

3079243 we have never been and will never be passive observers in the region
3079244 u s aircraft have made eight flights to bring georgian troops home from iraq
3079245 we are ready to increase our forces in view of the relocation of georgian troops
3079246 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are trying to get in the way i mean the united states using its military transport aircraft to relocate georgias military contingent from iraq virtually into the conflict zone among other things
3079247 of course it was right that saddam hussein was hanged for butchering several shia villages while the current georgian rulers who wiped out ten ossetian villages in no time and burnt people alive in their homes must be protected

3079328 understanding how elephants and other animal populations react to droughts will be a central component of wildlife management and conservation
3079329 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3079330 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference
3079331 the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia
3079332 the eu grand strategy is to develop georgia as an alternative route for caspian oil and gas by bypassing russia
3079333 but if georgia is no longer a safe passageway then all of these schemes for diminished dependency on russia go up in smoke
3079334 the first significant break in russias previous monopoly control over all oil and natural gas from the
3079335 azerbaijan and georgia for example rely on this pipeline for the political independence they often act out
3079336 an alternative pathway for the flow of caspian oil and gas to the west
3079337 georgia has been one of the leading recipients of u s military aid ever since
3079338 this of course infuriated the russians and they determined to try to curb georgias ties to the west in any way they possibly could
3079339 this work has led to an important discovery about the source of nitrogen that fuels the productivity of tropical ocean waters especially those into which large rivers flow
3079340 these organisms are regulated by the biogeochemistry of the river and are sensitive to land use alterations and climate change activities such as dam construction and changing agricultural practices will alter the magnitude of this drawdown
3079341 the important places are probably not the high latitudes but rather the low latitude areas where nitrogen fixation is a predominant process
3079342 15 cats meet three cats each those cats all meet 25 cats and they all go for a curry how many cats

3079344 i would like to tell president bush that somalis and americans have had long cordial relationship therefore dont destroy that long relationship by keeping ethiopian troops in somalia
3079345 somalis are brothers and sisters who share common culture and religion and therefore there are no endemic problems among them and i am sure they solve their problems
3079346 people now are ashamed to associate with somalia but time will come when people would be proud to call themselves somalis and when people come to somalia to find jobs

3079352 you are a great american a national treasure and i am glad to say my good friend
3079353 to barack i love your audacity with great respect and warmest wishes
3079354 we are the first city in the commonwealth of pennsylvania to ever have a full time bicycle pedestrian coordinator
3079355 we dont actually have anything that were delivering at this particular moment
3079356 this is a long term project and something thats going to continue
3079357 jason finished the race better than we could have asked for at the end as you could see i was pretty excited i was very emotional
3079358 i knew i was going to go faster than yesterday
3079359 me going out that fast really helped motivate these guys these guys went and did really great lengths themselves
3079360 we have the worlds coming up in november so i need to get 2 5 or five kg heavier if i want to win a medal
3079361 in this you can just do what you want to do and theres not really any pressure to break a record if it happens it happens
3079362 my goal today was 300 so im even a little happier that i got 302 i think i have a little more left but thats fine ill take the pb personal best in the total and the deadlift
3079363 normally in training i dont go to what i hope to do in the contest
3079364 i usually go to five maybe seven kilos below what i hope to do at a contest i attempted this four weeks ago in edmonton and lucked it out but my butt came off the bench this time i knew i had to just clean up the lift i knew i could do it but i just needed to clean up the lift
3079365 theres a variety of tactics that employers have been employing over the last three to six years that has had an impact on the market
3079366 pretty much every employer has to do something or is doing something in an effort to bring that number down
3079367 it is encouraging that the growth in health care costs is going down but there is still more work to be done
3079368 when costs go up as great as this theres a lot of market pressure brought to bear on all of the parts of the market to bring those costs down and i think thats whats been happening over the last six years or so
3079369 we had to delay start dates because we physically didnt have a seat for new employees
3079370 we have a great commitment to quality that you dont always see in bigger companies
3079371 because the lions the king of the jungle and im the king of the track
3079372 i went up to him and asked if i could have my picture taken with him
3079373 theres never been as much hype about a 100m dash as there is now
3079374 this is probably one of the hottest 100m in history asafa is looking good usain is running incredible times hes lighting up the track
3079375 these two guys are doing things no one has ever seen before and i fall into the category of someone who can run 9 7 too
3079376 having three guys whove run 9 7 seconds in the same race as well as two guys whove run 9 8 secs is amazing as everyone knows the world record used to be 9 9 and 9 8 but now weve got three men who can run 9 7 anything is possible
3079377 after four rounds you dont often see a world record time but this time could be different
3079378 i believe that i dont have to put on a self image or a swagger just because i race the 100m dash
3079379 it comes from the way i was raised sometimes when youre a child watching tv youll hear your mother say about someone hes too cocky and so then you know what not to be like
3079380 when i first arrived here i walked around the village and it was kind of amazing nothing compares to this
3079381 it was my 26th birthday on the 9 august and at one minute past midnight they that was the best present i could ever hope for right there
3079382 o phelps disse que vai querer ganhar 8 medalhas mas pra isso ele precisa ganhar a primeira

3079384 the opening will mark the halfway mark of an ambitious project under the australia indonesia partnership to build or expand 2000 high schools across 20 provinces by the end of 2009
3079385 australia is funding this program to help indonesia fulfil its vision that all young indonesians will have nine years of basic education
3079386 our construction alone will create some 330 000 new places in junior high schools including in some of indonesias poorest and remote areas
3079387 in all challenges indonesia can count on australia to work with it as a friend and partner
3079388 there were some good elements but also some poor ones it is a test of will and a chance for us to see who is good and who cant handle it
3079389 the offense has to get yardage and the defense has to keep from giving it up
3079390 at times we were terrible and at times we were impressive
3079391 we need more than one person to be a leader we need several i think some of the seniors will step forward i think darryl richard is a leader
3079392 you dont have to lead by talking michael johnson leads by playing at a 100 miles per hour
3079393 youve got 4 500 coaches and athletes from 23 states provinces and territories
3079394 they all came together and it was like one big family atmosphere except for the moments when youre actually competing in the sport its all friendship and bonding and camaraderie it was amazing
3079395 everybody just picked up their game and every time it looked like some team was challenging us or pushing us somebody would step up and make a big play and pick up the whole team and theyd just start rolling
3079396 ive seen a lot of volleyball and i was in awe at the way they pulled things out when things got tough
3079397 i was debating whether to get involved or take it easy this summer

3079399 i got on the bus on wednesday to say goodbye ot the kids that were leaving from the first half and i said to them
3079400 just because hes unfaithful in his marriage doesnt mean we cant believe him in his public life

3079408 if one is right from a legal point of view nothing more is required nobody may mention that one could still not be entirely right
3079409 gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states nor between classes nor between political parties either but right through every human heart and through all human hearts

3079411 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3079412 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3079413 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3079414 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3079415 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3079416 horatios timely discovery that there was no such thing as hell was convenient given his current difficulties
3079417 with neither money nor purpose guided solely by a sniffle from one of their prophetesses
3079418 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3079419 his death was not a surprise we were expecting it lately because he has had several heart operations all which were life threatening he insisted on undergoing the last operation against his doctors advise wanting to defeat death as he always did
3079420 i lost my friend twice first in 1972 when he traveled from moscow to cairo without telling anyone we only found out his whereabouts later and again when he was announced dead last saturday in houston texas
3079421 our consolation is his valuable heritage his poetry is global and i felt his importance when we were students in russia meeting other poets and international writers he was respected by all of them his cause was the concerns of all humans not only the palestinian cause he carried the concern of his people and nation and of all the oppressed in the world
3079422 mahmoud came to his mother he hugged her kissed her and held her hand and told her he is going through with the operation and he wanted to see her before he left
3079423 his mother cried a lot and begged him not to go and not to have the operation maybe because she felt with her mothers heart like all mothers that her son would not return but he had already made up his mind
3079424 with the loss of the poet of sweet and beautiful words the palestinian people loses one of the main contributors to our national and cultural identity who with his words immortalized the struggle of a people the sufferings of a nation whose culture was meant to be obliterated and marginalized he told the whole world about the palestinian pain hope determination and livelihood about its mountains valleys and plains about the scent of almond blossoms and beyond
3079425 i received the news of his death with great sorrow
3079426 darwish is one of the most revered international arab and palestinian names he was the one who presented the palestinians and the palestinian cause from a human perspective not as victims and not as terrorists he wanted to tell the world the palestinian is just human
3079427 what some people fail to appreciate is that our party is not a monolith as we like to say we are the party of the big tent there is no national litmus test on what makes a republican this is about american citizens who are reaching out to us to become republicans and we should include them because we have a big tent theres plenty of room for everyone and we should be proud that they want to join us

3079431 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3079432 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3079461 rape is being used as a weapon of political intimidation to instill fear in us our families and communities
3079462 widespread violence against women not only represents a global human rights crisis but also contributes to womens vulnerability to hiv
3079463 one of the biggest worries of the rape victims was that they may have become infected
3079464 we believe members of president robert mugabes inner circle who turned ruling party youth militia into rapists and killers are responsible for crimes against humanity
3079465 particularly true for women who are most affected by the epidemic as for far too long hiv positive women have been invited only after agendas have been set or policy decisions taken

3079469 i dont give a fuck what they call it im calling it the revolution
3079470 there is a tiny cell component that is unique to germ cells the precursors to egg and sperm called nuage which means cloud in french other researchers recently suspected that nuage was involved in keeping genes from jumping around in germ cells of the female fruit fly
3079471 but until this mouse study no one knew for sure if it was involved in mammalian germ cells to test if the mouse nuage played a similar role in mammals we focused on a mouse protein called maelstrom whose distant relative protein in the fruit fly was implicated in the other study
3079472 we found that without the gene the process of meiosis was severely impaired
3079473 there was a profound defect in interactions of parental chromosomes a process known as synapsis leading to death of germ cells this was clear evidence that the protein is vital to the formation of sperm
3079474 we observed massive flooding of the cytoplasm and nuclei of germ cells by transposons in the mutant mice
3079475 this was the first time such a phenomenon was observed in germ cells of any species
3079476 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3079477 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3079478 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future there are already drugs that inhibit particular ptks in the late stages of treatment our discovery could change the timing of when and how those or similar drugs are administered
3079479 our studies have shown that ptk pathways are intimately associated with the regulation of checkpoint responses during dna replication
3079480 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication they may lack a key enzyme called tcptp
3079481 but the big question remains what happens in the real world of human cancers
3079482 the prayer of an afflicted man who has grown weak
3079483 i groan aloud and am reduced to skin and bones
3079484 in the course of my life he broke my strength he cut short my days
3079485 i think the rain this last day and a half helped but the first two days when we got here i was struggling with the pollution the heat the humidity
3079486 you could really feel it in your lungs when you started to breathe heavily
3079487 i did not think it was going to be like that i have yet to see blue sky or sun i thought maybe there was going to be a small smog layer in patches but its literally a haze
3079488 weve managed to adapt to the situation from home to china
3079489 there is some pollution but for me everything about the environment i just take it out i dont want an excuse i cant control the enviornment and the pollution i havent tried any different things like a mask because in the race you have to do the race without the mask
3079490 both teams were breathing the same air we were more concerned with the heat and humidity
3079491 the truth i didnt feel nothing from the pollution that didnt affect me the problem is the humidity i had to change the shirt every 10 minutes
3079492 there was a domestic argument between the mother and father
3079493 he got upset and struck the mother in the face one or two times on the left cheek which caused some bruising from what im told he hit her with a closed fist
3079494 so theres no one who can improve on mourinhos record really it would have to go beyond mourinhos performance to really worry us and that will be a challenge with the players theyve got and the players theyve added
3079495 i believe we were very unlucky last season we lost the premier league by four points
3079496 we got 14 more points than the season before so this year we want to make another step forward challenge even more and win the title we feel there is no reason why with a young squad we should be less good this year than last year
3079497 clearly we have confidence in ourselves and have the quality to try to win every game but you never know what can happen in any competition
3079498 we started really well and finished really well last season if we can do the same this time then hopefully we will be better in the middle of the season

3079549 wtf is this load of crap and what the hell am i to do with it
3079550 companies dont seem to have a strong loyalty to the firms they currently use
3079551 at first you have to focus very seriously on making a right turn but after youve been doing it a while you dont even think about it you just do it
3079552 i believe that almost anybody can learn to do this but theyve got to stick with it
3079553 i see pricing as particularly hard and most people new at the consulting business dont know how to price one man operations should seriously consider whether they are charging enough
3079554 look at how much money you want to make a year and you work through how many days a week that you have to sell you cant sell 100 of your time you can sell maybe 50 of the time
3079555 keep working backwards until you figure out how big the market has to be and how many meetings and calls and contacts you have to make
3079556 those are substantial numbers and they are different for different people
3079557 persistence over a long time in the absence of clear results is the hardest thing that people have to deal with
3079558 when you first start its all inputs and no outputs
3079559 a high percentage of people are lead starved they just dont have enough leads in the first place
3079560 you want to meet people in the clients organization you want to go out of your way to meet people while youre working there
3079561 these are people who you would pay money to meet some other time and who youve got a ready made excuse to meet you have a lot of influence in how many you meet with and who they are
3079562 if you dont talk to anybody youre not going to sell anything
3079563 theres no formula for this if you like to give speeches you can give speeches its a great way to meet people and make a good impression on them but if you dont like to give speeches there are plenty of rainmakers that succeed without
3079564 if you want a relationship with someone youve got to stay in front of them you want some shared experiences and you need to help them and develop a mutual trust that relates to other people helping each other the foundations of relationships are based on shared time together
3079565 the mix will change from contact to contact depending on the contacts preferences of communication the importance of the contact to you and the date of the last face to face or voice to voice communication
3079566 very personal things for people that you dont know well are better in hard copy like condolences and congratulations
3079567 this is a major issue for people who are not experienced at developing business
3079568 the anxiety goes away after a while i can list all sorts of reasons for contacting people but its never going to be comfortable until you do it 300 times and when you do it 300 times and then maybe get a little more instruction then its quite natural and it ceases to be an issue
3079569 you can be in front of them as often as youre providing value and the challenge is to come up with something that provides value to them
3079570 there is one rainmaker a german rainmaker who was highly athletic and he would do things like bicycling across germany with clients and senior executives at client organizations and he would ask them who would they know who might like to come too so he would assemble these teams of people if you bicycle across germany with somebody you have a relationship with them
3079571 you have to earn the right to talk business with most people
3079572 these people are in business and theyre not bashful people that are embarrassed to think that you might want to meet them for business purposes because they meet people for business purposes too
3079573 what you dont want to do is surprise somebody with a sales call you dont want to invite them to lunch and they think its a social lunch and then pop the sales meeting
3079574 if a client brings up something during a lunch that the marketing consultant could help with but he isnt asking if the marketing person can help hes just bringing it up in conversation i would recommend asking permission to go into sales mode
3079575 you know bob i know you didnt come to have lunch with me today to be subjected to a sales pitch but thats something that we know a lot about and we could help you
3079576 its not going to do any good to push a sales meeting on someone that doesnt want one
3079577 you can also call the client directly and say were doing some stuff down here that i think you might be interested in on a business level can i come in and bring one of my guys and talk to you about it then youre setting up a sales environment apart from the social and personal
3079578 if it was someone you were calling once a quarter and seeing twice a year you might see them once a year and call once a year and eventually stop calling or you just dont call them as often but keep them in forever it depends on the individual
3079579 after it gets to a certain size you become more and more concerned about quality and youre gradually improving the quality of contacts by weeding out those that you just dont have the time for any more because nothing is going to come of it

3079583 the challenge i faced was with some of those less popular less searched terms that an equity analyst might use such as derivative or derivative models
3079584 i thought that the tools were lacking because they kind of led you back to broader based terms that i already had
3079585 i dont think there is any one source that can do the job for you
3079586 we look at three or four of them to come up with a baseline
3079587 we always test a keyword list for 30 days to see if we have a realistic baseline or benchmark for where we should be moving forward

3079610 if you want a relationship with someone youve got to stay in front of them you want some shared experiences and you need to help them and develop a mutual trust that relates to other people helping each other the foundations of relationships are based on shared time together
3079611 the mix will change from contact to contact depending on the contacts preferences of communication the importance of the contact to you and the date of the last face to face or voice to voice communication
3079612 very personal things for people that you dont know well are better in hard copy like condolences and congratulations
3079613 this is a major issue for people who are not experienced at developing business
3079614 the anxiety goes away after a while i can list all sorts of reasons for contacting people but its never going to be comfortable until you do it 300 times and when you do it 300 times and then maybe get a little more instruction then its quite natural and it ceases to be an issue
3079615 you can be in front of them as often as youre providing value and the challenge is to come up with something that provides value to them
3079616 there is one rainmaker a german rainmaker who was highly athletic and he would do things like bicycling across germany with clients and senior executives at client organizations and he would ask them who would they know who might like to come too so he would assemble these teams of people if you bicycle across germany with somebody you have a relationship with them
3079617 you have to earn the right to talk business with most people
3079618 these people are in business and theyre not bashful people that are embarrassed to think that you might want to meet them for business purposes because they meet people for business purposes too
3079619 what you dont want to do is surprise somebody with a sales call you dont want to invite them to lunch and they think its a social lunch and then pop the sales meeting
3079620 if a client brings up something during a lunch that the marketing consultant could help with but he isnt asking if the marketing person can help hes just bringing it up in conversation i would recommend asking permission to go into sales mode
3079621 you know bob i know you didnt come to have lunch with me today to be subjected to a sales pitch but thats something that we know a lot about and we could help you
3079622 its not going to do any good to push a sales meeting on someone that doesnt want one
3079623 you can also call the client directly and say were doing some stuff down here that i think you might be interested in on a business level can i come in and bring one of my guys and talk to you about it then youre setting up a sales environment apart from the social and personal
3079624 if it was someone you were calling once a quarter and seeing twice a year you might see them once a year and call once a year and eventually stop calling or you just dont call them as often but keep them in forever it depends on the individual
3079625 after it gets to a certain size you become more and more concerned about quality and youre gradually improving the quality of contacts by weeding out those that you just dont have the time for any more because nothing is going to come of it
3079626 whos the black private dick thats a sex machine to all the chicks
3079627 what diet and exercises are the best for me to do so i can see my abs
3079628 the shocking admission that we are unable to identify the origin of nearly half the biofuels used in the uk means that the government cannot assure the british people that the biofuels in their petrol tanks have not destroyed rainforests
3079629 that less than a fifth of the biofuels used fail to meet even minimal environmental standards adds further weight to friends of the earths view that they are a phoney solution to climate change
3079630 the government must put the rtfo on hold and vote against eu biofuels targets
3079631 this report is even worse than we feared and shows what a shambles the uks biofuels policies have become
3079632 here is yet more proof direct from a uk government body that voluntary environmental and social standards just arent working
3079633 these standards must be strengthened and made compulsory before targets are raised any further
3079634 we will continue to publish information as soon as we are able and will be reporting company performance figures in our october quarterly report
3079635 my postbag is full of letters from people saying they want to recycle more
3079636 but unless they know their efforts are making a real difference they wont keep trying thats why statistics like these are so important
3079637 the figures published today are provisional we will know the full picture by the end of the year but the early results show those efforts continue to be worthwhile
3079638 while these figures are another step in the right direction there is still much more to do
3079639 britain is the dustbin of europe and dumps more waste into the ground than any other country in the eu this is costing the council taxpayer dearly in landfill taxes
3079640 councils are still facing fines of up to 3bn if we do not dramatically reduce the amount of waste thrown into landfill
3079641 it is vital we look at alternatives to the status quo to deliver an ever better deal for the taxpayer
3079642 ten water supply options are being studied which include lough ree lough derg and parteen basin on the shannon river system
3079643 options involving storage of excess winter water for subsequent use in drier periods are being investigated for lough ree and lough derg
3079644 in addition to the shannon based options the studies are also investigating desalination and groundwater options
3079645 an irish company called emission zero will be measuring the carbon output from the generators that power the lights and the mics and everything on site

3079647 solar power has always been a limited far off solution

3079656 it is great to see a continuing increase in the rate of recycling and it shows that households around the country are making a considerable effort to recycle more
3079657 however we need people to recycle more used packaging as well as working to reduce the amount of packaging on the market
3079658 procedural texturing offers many potential technological and artistic benefits yet the process of translating a precise texture from an artists mind into a procedure is difficult to formulate
3079659 the greatest strength of the allegorithmic technology is that it has made fully procedural texturing a viable alternative to hand painting by means of a visual language appealing to artists as well as engineers we have been researching and integrating allegorithmic products into our engine for a few months now and we anticipate that profx and its future developments will remain an important and valuable addition to our core production pipeline and technology
3079660 my personal latest video game blast was god of war on the psp hence my excitement to see ready at dawn and their top notch team license profx for their very first project to be released on new generation platforms
3079661 i ordered some wine because i wanted to share my wine

3079667 the council has submitted objections to the planning application on the basis that the proposal does not comply with the dublin regional waste management plan and also because of concerns over the expected traffic problems which will be generated by the facility
3079668 the skies became hazy about two weeks ago and by next week we should have clear skies again because of the inter monsoon winds
3079669 because of the morning showers the dust particles are cleared up quite quickly so the visibility usually improves for a while
3079670 however fair weather in the later part of the day reduces the visibility again because there is no rain to clear the air
3079671 the nine stores are located in areas where we can leverage our operations advertising and logistics
3079672 the stores are averaging 25 000 square feet and provide extended coverage in areas where the company already understands the customers needs

3079679 i would have liked for tabar v zquez to take the initiative
3079680 military officers and civilian members of the dictatorship have been prosecuted bodies of some desaparecidos have been located and many incidents of repression have been publicized the other notable aspect is the interest generated by our effort in the 90s activities of human rights groups were isolated and received with indifference including by parts of the left
3079681 today there is a will among a majority of the country to move ahead and the only remaining
3079682 you cant have in the judicial system of a country a law that protects military officers who raped political prisoners tortured and murdered detainees kidnapped children and disappeared people

3079689 i have wanted to go to iraq and perform for the troops for a long time rainbow and deep purple have always had a lot of fans in the military i tried to go via the uso as a volunteer musician and was turned down we were overloaded with emails from service men and women many who are big fans of this genre of music and wanted me to come over for a show i know this will be a life changing experience
3079690 i cannot imagine how hard it is to be so far from home and away from so many loved ones in such challenging conditions and at this time when there is so much debate and people are questioning what we are doing and whether it is the right thing to do at this moment in world history our troops have an obligation to make sacrifices stand strong and defend our country at a moments notice this is the least thing that i could do to remind them that i think about them all the time and enough to come and visit them in person and bring them a little piece of back home rocknroll
3079691 the five shows that the guys will be doing in kuwait and iraq are not only open to the men and women of all u s forces
3079692 but also to all of the allied forces joining us in the fight against terrorism and the contract personnel stationed at the bases who are performing important jobs in support of our militaries all of the shows are free of charge to everyone in attendance big noize will truly draw an audience from around the world as personnel from england australia south korea and even iraq to name a few will be able to rock out to the hits of the classic rock bands represented by the band

3079701 if we play like we played this week we will beat australia
3079702 but it is going to take a lot to do it
3079703 the structure the players weve got the type of attack we have now the way we have gone about the game every single day the emotions the guys showed it is certainly not far away from a perfect start and the way i want to play the cricket in the future
3079704 i have done a lot of thinking over the last few days you do find yourself thinking about the game more and different scenarios
3079705 i have certainly done some thinking about australia next year a lot more than i would have when i was a player
3079706 because you want to get the structure right so guys can play in certain positions feel comfortable know their role and deliver
3079707 it will be important over the next nine months to learn their roles and then deliver
3079708 my main driving force for this team is to be every single day up for the challenge of improving having no comfort zones and testing the guys out to perform every single day
3079709 one area we will need to improve on is our batting that is an area of concern and something we need to do
3079710 he came back in after a time out and he was magnificent
3079711 when i told steve he was playing i told him i wanted him to bowl fast to bowl straight and to be the old steve harmison
3079712 i gave him the extra responsibility of getting runs at nine he said he would do his best and his best was good enough for me this week
3079713 weve seen this week how important hes going to be for us hes a huge player
3079714 i am going to be looking after steve as much as i can but also making sure i get the best out of him i think i know the sort of ways to do it
3079715 he said he would see but the travel has always been the problem for steve being away from his family
3079716 i respect the man for the decisions he makes but it would be lovely to have him coming in first change with the white ball having said that you dont always get what you want
3079717 obviously they left steve out for a reason and they wanted to see him prove himself that he was worth bringing back
3079718 if he bowls like he has bowled in this test match then he is going to be an asset for england
3079719 he has a good record and if they are going to pick their team like this then he has got to play

3079732 during this event we will see an interesting presentation regarding the importance of the interrelation between tourism and handicrafts not only due to their contribution to poverty reduction but also to our appreciation of cultural identity
3079733 with the development of the 5th summit of heads of state and government of the european union latin america and the caribbean eu lac we have shown that we are capable of carrying out events of first level and i believe that the third international conference on tourism and handicraft will be an event at a same level

3079740 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
3079741 im proud of him because politics is dirty especially with republicans
3079742 didnt seem to fit the world that i thought stephenie meyer created
3079743 you see the punch coming that doesnt mean its not gonna hurt when it hits
3079744 theres no way to make everybody happy when i do one thing that a lot of people want theres always the opposite reaction
3079745 but how can you possibly meet up with the expectations that this book had
3079746 it just got so built up there is no book in the world that could stand up to that so i knew it was going to happen but at the same time it hurts
3079747 if they really love the characters then i would hope that this would make sense to them because these are the true characters
3079748 this is the story the way it was always meant to be
3079749 it doesnt always work out that way sometimes you make a decision about what you want and you pay for it and you suffer for it and it doesnt work out those types of stories always leave me horribly depressed im not going to live in a world for a year at a time where thats going to be the ending if people wanted a really depressing tragic ending i gave them a lot of hints that it wasnt going to be that way they really shouldnt have been surprised
3079750 i should have known that people would feel that way
3079751 the name has been real to me for so long now that ive forgotten how unusual it would sound to everyone else
3079752 ive read a lot of books that i didnt like very much and that thought never occurred to me because i had read them i hadnt heard of doing that before thats not fun to hear
3079753 i hope that if they really do enjoy the other books theyll realize that this is kind of where it was supposed to go
3079754 were working on setting up a really annoying system for them to filter
3079755 it seemed so weird last time we spoke you admitted to a lifelong fear of condiments i dont want to get you upset
3079756 ive lost one of my best buddies and it is not easy to reckon with
3079757 i know one can never put a question mark where
3079758 personally my buddy will be missed for many reasons by me he was family he will be a part of my musical life each time i sing the song
3079759 the lord of the rings the return of the king
3079760 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hard core family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3079761 one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
3079762 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
3079763 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather
3079764 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
3079765 a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives
3079766 his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set
3079767 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
3079768 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
3079769 ien en twie en drij en vier naar voren ien en twie en drij en vier naar achter en draaieuh
3079770 you guys are lucky you get to see us rehearse
3079771 i want this to end when im on top so im planning my final show on december 21 2012 its when the mayan calendar ends its the day when solids become liquids and liquids become plasmas
3079772 so im building up to that weve got four years so maybe theres going to be a couple other small releases in the works the album just came out so i have no plans for another release but im constantly starting to work on new stuff just for the live shows
3079773 i used to play very short sets and now i kinda play a standard 45 minute to one hour set so i think i wanna do a 24 hour set and i want it to be a stage production but one where the lines become blurry between reality and complete stage me i want it to be an endurance test and i want it to be miserable and equally fantastic i want the best of both worlds
3079774 i think in too many shows people are too aimed at pleasing the audience if you want to do a really great show which i havent fully done yet you have to really make it bad for them for like 20 hours and then you can kill it for four hours and everyone will be really excited i think people ignore the dynamics of how you can work with an audience

3079777 if youre a ruby programmer and you like ruby as a language context switching into javascript is just something you have to do
3079778 its a tax youre trading productivity away arbitrarily because thats just what runs in the browser and its much more interesting when you can run the same language on both sides the client and the server so you dont have to do that context switch
3079779 sure you could do it that way but then at some point you might have to add some javascript code that adds some custom functionality on the client yourself
3079780 so theres always that sense of now im in another world and wouldnt it be nice if i have this utility class i wrote in ruby today if i want to use it in the browser i have to port it to javascript now i can just run it in the browser
3079781 the part that is important at least as far as rails programmers are concerned with is they would like to be able to do some ruby on the client javascript is no longer the ugly stepchild that it used to be but its quirky in certain ways thats not to say that ruby isnt but ruby has more oohs and ahs about it than javascript does
3079782 if we do our jobs right and we get silverlight to play very widely then all of a sudden for folks that are interested in doing some arax they can they have to ask do we want to take a dependency on this thing its pretty brain dead to take a dependency on flash because flash is everywhere already so this becomes a more compelling scenario over time
3079783 if this is about using silverlight to host client side browser scripting in ruby its definitely an appealing notion but the problem will always be about silverlight being a microsoft technology
3079784 as long as windows office dominates microsofts balance sheet these cross platform microsoft plays always feel a bit like the story of the boy who upon encountering a rattlesnake picks it up after it promises not to hurt him upon which the snake promptly bites after the boy protests the snake says you knew what i was when you picked me up no matter what capabilities silverlight may have i think most of us in the community simply wouldnt dream of embracing architectures dependent on microsofts goodwill to support other os vendors
3079785 it is interesting to note that you have been able to use jruby to run ruby in the browser for quite some time ironruby is great getting more languages into the browser is great
3079786 silverlight and the plug in ria wars caught me by surprise i didnt expect ruby to have a chance at the client this may make arax become more popular than ajax because you can actually write client based applications in silverlight with ruby in the near future if everything goes well
3079787 why do i think that ruby is better than javascript mostly because it expresses objects more respectably and it has a cleaner syntax that works in an obvious way to me as developer this makes the code very readable and easy to use
3079788 our goal was to show that rails guys could use silverlight as well
3079789 and if you wanted to use ruby to do some html stuff if you want to do arax on the client awesome knock yourself out
3079790 we showed some dynamic stuff happening we demonstrated we could dispatch to a controller which will render using a view and then we showed we could use activerecord to round trip from sql server and return like a single row so we could demonstrate we could go through the active record path so we can read from database we can create databases i dont think we can update or delete or any of that stuff yet but thats coming this was a demonstration of our commitment to building a ruby that runs real ruby programs
3079791 look around at the rails conference everybodys carrying a mac here
3079792 and this community is a very unix y community there are just no if ands or buts about it so for us coming here and showing ironruby running rails we werent under any illusions that people would convert to us simply because of that so what we wanted to show was something new something different we allow people to run ruby in the browser in a cross platform way with a very lightweight download
3079793 just like jruby provides people who are stuck with an inventory of java infrastructure and programs an easy way into ruby so does ironruby for those who are still sitting on a microsoft stack
3079794 as with jruby though i dont expect a lot of ruby programmers with no existing connection to microsoft to go gaga over it
3079795 that will give you a local copy of the merged changes which you can immediately check in if satisfactory
3079796 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
3079797 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
3079798 we think this is a great opportunity for the sector we are very enthusiastic
3079799 that said there are currently more than 160 million domain names and i do not expect to see the same number of new extensions created in 2009
3079800 web 2 0 is about service providers exposing their business services on the web bringing them together in a common view for the employee and under a common management umbrella for the corporation
3079801 for example one can easily build applications to track sales leads manage employee recruiting and hiring or set up intramural sports leagues
3079802 refers to web based services that emphasize online collaboration and information exchange by user communities
3079803 web 2 0 has proven to be an exercise in dealing with the unexpected part 1 of this two part series offers definitions gleaned from an informal survey of tech and content executives they touched upon such issues as community personalization customization and editorial control
3079804 two of the hallmarks of web 2 0 are more fluid desktop type interfaces and emphasizing online collaboration among users
3079805 web 2 0 is about service providers exposing their business services on the web bringing them together in a common view for the employee and under a common management umbrella for the corporation
3079806 its a best of both worlds scenario where employees or customers have all the useful features in one place that they need to do their jobs more effectively and make smart choices
3079807 but where the corporation still has the ability to control and manage whats being offered
3079808 an advanced web 2 0 architecture provides the opportunity to add or remove services and vendors on a fluid real time basis with just a few clicks of a mouse

3079890 were in the works of doing a whole lot of very creative stuff
3079891 the whole album every song is a movie thats basically how it comes down i dont even have features on the album the first single is not even featuring chris brown and sean garrett its co starring chris brown and sean garrett thats what i have on this album its all stars basically its co starring people because its a movie every song is a movie creatively and conceptually i think people are definitely going to understand that this is something that was very creatively put together it took a minute but every song is very serious
3079892 for us to accomplish that mission we needed to shed a lot of extra baggage
3079893 we needed to focus a little more we needed to make quicker decisions we needed to be ok saying no to certain stuff and we needed to weed through stuff quicker
3079894 one of the coolest things was rick actually suggested that we all stand up and rock out like we would live
3079895 and we did and it put a lot of life into the basic tracking of it all it was almost to the point where when i was retracking stuff i was standing up headbanging id never done that in a recording situation before hes a great song doctor and he has great ears
3079896 the great thing about working with rick is hes never around
3079897 i would say thats a very strong point in that it leaves the four of us to take on the entire brunt of the work and the planning that goes into the songwriting process and the recording process
3079898 bob would add a lot of his own musical input and with that came a lot of his own influences and style and jurisdiction and idiosyncrasies
3079899 and it would eventually make it into our sound but with rick because he wasnt there its almost 100 percent undiluted metallica hed come in and say thats good that isnt change that and we would have to figure that out for ourselves this is the most pure weve sounded in a long time
3079900 rick is not the kind of producer like a bob rock whos there every moment holding your hand making you step up
3079901 rock arranged everything all the time and wore many hats in the studio rick rubin no hat rick comes in and goes well wheres the songs ok thats good thats not so good more of this less of that see you in a few months goodbye and thats what we needed that brutal honesty to get through it and it worked
3079902 the slipknot that he did the system of a down records he did and even the johnny cash stuff where its the essence of him and you hear him you hear whats going on thats what i want i want people to really hear metallica
3079903 so in a way its got somewhat of an older sound songs and arrangement wise weve got a lot more diversity on the record instrumentals fast shorter songs epic ballady moments its quite different from st anger where if youre angry this is your album and if youre not it might take some work
3079904 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time

3079982 lending policies and procedures and credit quality will remain the key areas on which we will continue to concentrate during the remainder of 2008 and into 2009
3079983 we remain confident in our ability to manage our bank through this difficult and volatile environment there are several metrics on which we base this optimism first we believe that our net interest margin has bottomed during the second quarter of 2008 and expect it to expand over the next two quarters as 48 of our cds reprice at lower rates secondly we anticipate cost savings related to the cardinal transaction to be in the range of 750 000 over the second half of 2008 which should positively impact operating expenses we do recognize that our asset quality may deteriorate slightly during the second half of the year nevertheless for the remainder of 2008 we believe that yadkin valley will outperform the industry average recorded in the second quarter which showed nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans at 1 01 and median net charge off ratio of 0 31
3079984 ocegs grc capability model is the only publicly vetted framework i know of that has taken the best from every other set of standards or guidance and combined them to establish clear and concise practices for an effective approach to compliance wherever you operate
3079985 it takes the basic structure for effective compliance in the federal sentencing guidelines and fills it out with a wealth of useful guidance for practitioners and compliance professionals i am pleased to have been involved in its development and i encourage everyone to review it and use it
3079986 the grc capability model tm sets out the elements of an effective grc system that integrate the principles of good governance risk management compliance ethics and internal control
3079987 oceg created the grc capability model tm with the input of hundreds of governance risk compliance audit and ethics experts in a wide array of industries to provide a roadmap for organizations of all sizes and structures to use when creating improving or assessing their own systems of people process and technologies to address their grc needs
3079988 the red book is a valuable resource for any company even those doing a good job addressing compliance right now
3079989 it provides a blueprint for improving organizational culture and enhancing business integration and strategic alignment of compliance governance and risk management practices we are pleased to offer this important tool for strengthening compliance efforts
3079990 mapping the grc information to the common and best practices set out in the oceg model and the additional domain content from oceg adds tremendous value by providing the latest and most updated events and information surrounding grc
3079991 oceg is an invaluable resource for businesses everywhere that are pursuing a holistic approach to grc
3079992 until oceg issued the red book it was virtually impossible to undertake an efficient assessment of compliance programs or approaches to risk assessment
3079993 now we have a real framework against which we can measure the appropriateness of a programs design and its operation and to benchmark against and ocegs burgundy book containing procedures and assessment criteria to facilitate management and evaluation of a grc system will be a great addition to this tool kit as well
3079994 the red book initially went through an extensive public comment period during which over 5 000 individuals reviewed it and was beta tested in leading companies including dell wachovia qwest archer daniels midland gevity hr and staples with test support from ernst amp young pricewaterhousecoopers deloitte grant thornton and aon consulting
3079995 we have refined the model based on its first two years of use adding content that will help any organization achieve what oceg calls principled performance r by making strong compliance and risk management a competitive and operational advantage
