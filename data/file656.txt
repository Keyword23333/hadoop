6560205 its kind of the go to one that ive been able to throw for a strike and expand it and throw it out of the zone lately which is really good the changeup is still kind of something i have in my back pocket its not really a good pitch for the college hitters i usually face because it speeds up their bats but its definitely something to show to some more advanced hitters hopefully i can use it a bit more here
6560206 every pitchers going to have days where nothings clicking and then hes gonna have days where hes right on
6560207 honestly i learn a lot more about pitching when im pitching on the days when i dont have my best stuff when i really gave to go out there and have to out think the hitter thats the days when i really get better as a pitcher
6560208 with korea you worry more about changing batting orders than the players
6560209 we will use all our resources in hitting and pitching for a win friday our past seven wins doesnt mean anything now
6560210 the rivalry between cuba and the u s a is close to my heart
6560211 this is a big ballgame these are two teams with great quality
6560212 its a big motivation for us to win the olympics baseball is a big game in cuba and this being the last time it is in the olympics it will be very emotional for cubans
6560213 theyve had the most success of any team in the world
6560214 theyve been dominant in world cups and theyve been dominant in most of the olympics so its a thrill to have the opportunity to play them
6560215 we still think were the best club in north america or south america so we welcome the challenge we enjoy playing cuba
6560216 this is an exceptional important step particularly for new jerseyans who struggle with property taxes as well as all of the other rising levels of inflationary costs
6560217 on the state level we remain vigilant in our dedication to property tax relief for homeowners
6560218 over 600 000 here in new jersey own property pay property taxes but do not itemize on their income taxes
6560219 as a senior citizen on a fixed income this is certainly going to help with our property taxes
6560220 a lot of people are in the trade and playing it from both sides there is a lot of doubt about the direction of both oil and financials
6560221 investors are still trying to find an equilibrium between financials and energy a lot of traders have been burnt playing both sides of the trade and i would expect further gyrations particularly ahead of the weekend
6560222 credit spreads continue to widen and that is not good for the equity market
6560223 it looks like oil is heading for 125 a barrel and financials will not find a bottom until there is some light in housing
6560224 a decent amount of supply needs to be sold in the coming months and last week a couple of deals from financials traded meaningfully behind their current secondary debt levels
6560225 existing uncertainties around the crude supply outlook this year given potential project delays in other non opec countries such as canada or brazil
6560226 just from watching this trailer i learned that richard nixon was the inspiration for batmans voice in the dark knight
6560227 oh my god im an adult now time is flying make it stop
6560228 the question really is how many guys got that number of medals for not being shot down
6560229 we have set a few firsts in the recent elections
6560230 the comelec is slowly but surely shedding off its old image
6560231 the first fraud free ballot counting election in more than half a century
6560232 in addition to the electoral process achievements the voting solution deployed in the philippines represents the highest standard of election integrity and auditability in the world the basic solution was certified for reliability by an independent testing agent according to u s voting standard guidelines and utilizes most of the innovations patented by avante to solve all the potential issues of electronic voting

6560235 we greatly appreciate the generosity of navistar and the creativity and skills of chrome shop mafia
6560236 this is a great example of how our products can be retrofit onto a vehicle to offer a truly custom look
6560237 we had a lot of fun working on serious bizness
6560238 the truck came off looking powerful aggressive and is a real off roaders dream
6560239 we were excited with the opportunity to have one of our cxts customized by chrome shop mafia
6560240 i think serious bizness is going to generate some serious excitement and will ultimately provide a great benefit for a charitable organization

6560245 it s difficult to work so hard against a bill that has such good intentions
6560246 but sb 201 actually creates a detour around the regulation of raw milk and must be re written before the bill is ready there are children on life support because of raw milk tainted with e coli and other toxic bacteria and there will be more of them in california and nationwide unless changes are made to this legislation
6560247 raw milk given that it is outside the pasteurization process has inherent risks
6560248 illnesses from raw milk and raw colostrum e coli campylobacter and listeria are on the rise and we ve seen first hand a growing number of consumers whose lives will never be the same because of this product dee creek farm e coli o157 h7 11 ill 4 with hemolytic uremic syndrome or hus grace harbor farms e coli o157 h7 2 children ill one with hus organic pastures e coli o157 h7 6 ill 2 children with hus herb depot e coli o157 h7 two children ill town farm dairy e coli o157 h7 5 ill 2 with hus alexandre family ecodairy farms campylobacter 15 illnesses one on a ventilator
6560249 it s the large producers of raw milk products that sb 201 aims to regulate
6560250 because of the haccp loophole a huge amount of contaminated product could reach the public this bill is intended to stop them but instead will give them a free ride for years to come california legislators and governor schwarzenegger please send sb 201 back

6560254 i think the media has made a whole lot of nonsense out of absolutely nothing and has gone on speculation and gossip
6560255 weve been respecting the process and making sure we have all the proper permits
6560256 ive already sold 10 000 tickets there so i will be going to put on a concert for the fans
6560257 were not hiding anything simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9 02 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
6560258 we know this show is gonna suck and its gonna be more cheesy than any other show before it all people want to see is kelly and brenda together on the screen again and once the cool factor has worn off from that theres no reason for anyone to watch
6560259 jon voight your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about forty million dollars a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
6560260 mayers childish behavior only confirms she was right to dump him now hes acting like a spoiled child expect jen to behave like a lady
6560261 jen was tired of paying for everything cobwebs come flying out of mayers wallet when he opens it john liked living like a movie star when he was with her jen would never say anything but you could tell it irritated her
6560262 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what f ck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from

6560269 it is hard to worry about draining the swamp when you are waist deep in aligators
6560270 why spend all the extra money converting cars and building a whole new much more dangerous energy infrastructure for h2 why wpend all that energy compressing h2 why drive around with a bomb in your trunk how much energy are you going to waste hauling around the extra weight of the h2 storage system
6560271 we will offer identity cards to young people in 2010 to assist them in proving their identity as they for example open their first bank account take out a student loan or start employment
6560272 an employee can only be managed by an employee with job manager
6560273 the project assignment start and end dates for an employee should lie between the start and end dates defined for the project
6560274 i think he will bend over backward not to give markets much to go on just ask yourself what has happened since the last federal open market committee meeting

6560279 prin intermediul festivalului ne dorim sa incurajam publicitatea neconventionala un aspect pentru care nu se depune inca suficient de mult efort in romania astfel adfel creeaza si aduna de la an la an cele mai bune idei neconventionale pentru a demonstra ca publicitatea este mai fun si mai dezirabila atunci cand este interactiva si cand se foloseste si de altceva decat de canalele clasice rolul festivalului este si acela de a veni in intampinarea acelor branduri care doresc sa comunice inovativ unor consumatori deschisi catre astfel de interactiuni
6560280 la fel ca anul trecut festivalul pastreaza o componenta culturala puternica promovand idei si cauze sustinute de organizatii implicate in activitati culturale si sociale
6560281 in romania marjele de profit din acest domeniu sunt cuprinse intre 5 10 in timp ce in tarile vestice aceste marje sunt sub 5
6560282 in prezent avem o cota de piata de aproximativ 10 insa in urmatorii 3 ani preconizam o dublare a acestei cote de piata ceea ce ne va pozitiona in primii 3 jucatori locali
6560283 daca piata va creste in medie cu 30 40 de precente noi vom creste cu 80 anual dublu fata de ritmul acesteia si in acest fel vom ajunge la cota de piata preconizata
6560284 cred ca in 5 ani piata curieratului din romania va ajunge la nivelul celor din tari precum austria sau polonia
6560285 in ultimii ani romania a devenit o tara in care se produce foarte mult iar aceasta productie trebuie transportata in tarile vestice deci sunt multe oportunitati aici
6560286 hey look i know that guy hes a fuckin idiot i bet he doesnt do it
6560287 chiar din momentul lansarii sale pe piata europeana ford kuga a creat un orizont de asteptare destul de ridicat in romania astfel ca am devansat momentul aducerii lui in europa kuga a inregistrat vanzari de peste 5 500 unitati numai in primul semestru al acestui an
6560288 analiza concentrarii economice efectuata de catre consiliul concurentei a ilustrat faptul ca aceasta operatiune nu are ca efect crearea sau consolidarea unei pozitii dominante care sa conduca la restrangerea inlaturarea sau denaturarea semnificativa a concurentei pe pietele pe care acestea isi desfasoara activitatea astfel nu exista indoieli serioase privind compatibilitatea operatiunii cu un mediu concurential normal
6560289 au incercat sa ne ceara cu 2 mai mult decat au avut si noi am refuzat sa le acordam sporul de comision deoarece numarul de roviniete a crescut si afacerea a devenit profitabila
6560290 contractul este valabil de anul trecut nu se renegociaza este in curs de semnare un act aditional dar care nu are nimic de a face cu renegocierea comisionului petrom nu a cerut in niciun moment renegocierea procentului petrom stabileste centralizat cantitatile de distribuit in statii in functie de istoricul de vanzari al fiecarei statii in parte si in functie de cantitatile de roviniete puse la dispozitie de catre cnadnr sa stocurile mici repartizate sunt consecinta directa a neonorarii comenzilor de catre cnadnr sa
6560291 toate crizele de roviniete in decursul timpului se datoreaza aprovizionarii defectuoase din partea cnadnr sa mai mult cnadnr sa are obligatia de a onora comenzile noastre in zece zile ca si exemplu ultima noastra comanda este din data de 12 08 si este inca neonorata
6560292 statia petrom tandarei a fost aprovizionata in data de 4 august 2008 data plecarii coletului cu 460 roviniete din care 100 de autoturism de 7 zile si 100 de autoturism de 30 zile aceste cantitati au reprezentat in mod evident o cantitate insuficienta datorita stocurilor scazute la aceste sortimente astazi stocul la aceste doua sortimente este zero nu se poate face nici macar o reaprovizionare a acelor statii care au ramas fara roviniete de autoturisme comisionul nu se renegociaza
6560293 the whole 1968 prague invasion was really overblown western propaganda
6560294 we will host a russian missile system in our country to counter the us
6560295 my vp wont be like that other vice president who thinks he is above the law
6560296 campaign appointed debate negotiators house democratic caucus chairman rahm emanuel d il and senator lindsey graham r sc said they were pleased to have reached an early agreement to provide the american people with the opportunity to see and hear the candidates debate the critical issues facing the country
6560297 the earliest agreement on presidential debates reached in any general election in recent history
6560298 my vp wont be like that other vice president who thinks he is above the law
6560299 we will host a russian missile system in our country to counter the us
6560300 it was a unique adventure and it was all the more special to me because i play other sports as well as football
6560301 against belgium we lacked a little experience and i think that the loss of tommaso rocchi was a factor
6560302 in any case i will always take the experience with me and i will be able to tell my children that i was in beijing
6560303 the united states has 2 trillion barrels of oil shale
6560304 this is more than seven times the amount of crude oil reserves found in saudi arabia and is enough to meet current u s demand for over 250 years
6560305 the u s could completely end its dependence on opec by 2020
6560306 even a moderate estimate of 800 billion barrels of recoverable oil from oil shale in the green river formation is three times greater than the proven oil reserves of saudi arabia
6560307 the best way to understand the dramatic transformation of unknown books into bestsellers or the rise of teenage smoking or the phenomena of word of mouth or any number of the other mysterious changes that mark everyday life
6560308 is to think of them as epidemics ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread just like viruses do
6560309 wasnt just the man with the biggest rolodex in colonial boston
6560310 there was a deluge of rain and that incorporated with the high tide produced severe flooding
6560311 there was about two to three feet of water affecting many residential and commercial properties
6560312 weve got dry suits weve got wading polls weve got lines weve got rescue sleds all that equipment was put to good use
6560313 the water started to flood over the toilets like a river and within about 15 minutes it was up to about six or seven inches all through my basement
6560314 its gone right underneath the counter right to the back wall to the stock room
6560315 unsurprisingly commodity currencies such as the nzd and aud also gained
6560316 we understand that people are keen to quantify the support the shareholders will offer on top of the equity they already have in the company
6560317 however it would be inappropriate to pre empt this while the company follows through due process with the trustees and their advisers
6560318 will have tens of millions of dollars more from them supporting the business as we go through the recovery plan
6560319 meaning that debenture investors get paid out before any of this money is accessible to shareholders
6560320 what we now see is some idea within the fiji interim government that they can get a new constitution without any proper process
6560321 i dont think there is anything inherently bad about fijis constitution or electoral laws
6560322 the point is the commodore has decided he doesnt like it its no way to change a countrys fundamental laws like electoral law just because a person decides he doesnt like it
6560323 secondly for the first time the leaders of the pacific islands forum have embraced the possibility of suspension of a member state to be adopted against fiji should they continue not to embrace their undertakings for march 2009 elections
6560324 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6560325 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6560326 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6560327 the bright critics assembled in this volume will doubtless show in
6560328 the government of canada is committed to working with our territorial partners to address issues of substance abuse victimization and recidivism among aboriginal youth
6560329 it is important that we focus crime prevention resources on programs that work at the local level and respond directly to the needs of aboriginal communities
6560330 i am very pleased the federal government is making these vital investments in northern youth children are our most vulnerable citizens it is our duty to protect them from people who would harm them we must support child victims give young people places where they are safe and deal with the root causes of crime to protect them from those who would lure them into lives of crime i want to thank minister nicholson for listening to our concerns and acting to provide real solutions
6560331 that is why we diverted the investments because we knew the issue was complex and it wasnt enough to just resolve the strike we need to feel assured that it the future other issues wouldnt come into play causing the mine cananea to be stopped over and over again
6560332 towards the end of the 1980s we decided we had to seek opportunities abroad mainly in the us
6560333 today we are the second biggest producer in america and second long products producer in the world
6560334 even in uruguay a country next door to us we had to learn and understand their culture
6560335 back then in north america south american companies had to overcome a good amount of hurdles
6560336 banks for example looked at us with a certain amount of suspicion
6560337 one of our biggest enemies is the expensive cost of freight
6560338 today 46 of our assets are outside of brazil compared to just 2 10 years ago
6560339 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6560340 wearing traditional muslim dress has encouraged me its not an obstacle its quite the opposite i feel very special to be in this situation and i dont feel any pressure by it
6560341 weve begun to notify our partners that we intend to relinquish operatorship of hebron to exxonmobil
6560342 with respect to the agreement the change in operatorship means no change whatsoever with respect to the commitments in the agreements
6560343 all parties to the agreements are fully committed to delivering on each and every benefit and each and every commitment thats made so thats assured
6560344 although i have managed to become a writer my true aim is somehow to become a book
6560345 i feel like im a victim of somebody preying on me
6560346 maybe well get on at the hospital but it wont be for the jobs we went to school for
6560347 i feel bad for them but under rules of the program theyre supposed to be big boys and girls able to make a decision on their own
6560348 i actually did the clinical and found out i knew nothing
6560349 i knew absolutely nothing i was told to get a peak flow i had no idea what it was
6560350 dentists in england are more likely to extract teeth or fit false ones than fit fillings or crowns under a new contract introduced two years ago
6560351 more than a million people have now lost access to nhs dental care those that are able to access care are confronted with a system that discourages modern preventive care by placing targets rather than patients at its heart
6560352 talks have been held with countries including japan about offloading large numbers of eurofighter typhoons that the british ministry of defence has ordered but can no longer afford the uk and italy asked late last year what it would cost to buy fewer aircraft than agreed initially or none at all but both options were regarded as unworkable because they would incur such a high financial penalty the eurofighter contract is written so tightly that it would be almost as cheap to take delivery of the aircraft as to incur the penalties
6560353 children in need inadvertently handed 20 000 to the 7 7 london bombers the bbc charity cash was given to a bookshop run by mohammed siddique khan and shehzad tanweer who spent it on videos glorifying holy war
6560354 the act of placing the same keywords or phrases on multiple pages of a website in titles and content in order improve ranking in the search engines leading to confusion with search engines on which page to rank in the results
6560355 well i really want to rank well for the keyword
6560356 once upon a time bridges were all about getting people from one side of a river to the other
6560357 but in the past few decades not just in britain but also elsewhere in europe the bridge has started to be used as something more than a mere means of conveying traffic across water
6560358 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
6560359 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
6560360 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
6560361 ok we dont have to go longer on that one
6560362 de manier van werken van de wereldraad is niet veranderd sinds de tijd dat hij veel geld en aandacht kreeg
6560363 wat meer bescheidenheid zou nu op zijn plaats zijn dat grote kantoor in gen ve mag van mij wel gesloten worden een aantal kleinere kantoren in verschillende landen lijkt me wel zo effici nt
6560364 maar op een nederige manier niet met een opgeheven vingertje
6560365 de rol van de wereldraad van kerken is niet meer van hetzelfde kwalitatief hoge niveau als vroeger
6560366 de tijden zijn veranderd sinds 1948 daarom vragen wij ons af kan de wereldraad met nieuwe antwoorden komen op de vragen van deze tijd
6560367 de verhouding met andere godsdiensten lijkt onderaan het lijstje prioriteiten van de wereldraad te staan dat moet naar boven en ook het milieu verdient meer aandacht
6560368 zie het als een feestje van vrienden wij willen graag een cadeau geven aan de jarige wereldraad
6560369 als je van je grootvader een cadeau krijgt is dat toch leuk het is een soort geintje niet d jubileumactiviteit

6560371 we are going to respond in a determined focused effective way by defending freedom no matter what the cost and that includes understanding we cannot let the worlds worst leaders blackmail the united states or our friends and allies with the worlds worst weapons
6560372 okay so they dont need to have used those exact words but even saddam hasnt said we plan to nuke the usa
6560373 once the united states believes it has both a strong spear and a strong shield it could lead them to conclude that nobody can harm the united states and they can harm anyone they like anywhere in the world
6560374 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6560375 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6560376 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong

6560384 cautand un stil de viata aparte oamenii de afaceri din romania se orienteaza catre zonele centrale si ultracentrale ale bucurestiului pentru a avea parte de confortul stilul si comunitatile care s au creat in zonele de vile din centrul capitalei sunt persoane sensibile atat la stilul arhitectonic al casei cat si la siguranta pe care o ofera o astfel de zona pentru familie si nu in ultimul rand pentru masina din proprietate cele mai apreciate avantaje ale vilelor din zonele de lux singur la curte curtea interioara garajul subteran sau aflat in curte
6560385 remarcam pe piata de vile tendinta de reintregire a proprietatilor si dorinta de achizitionare a intregului imobil de catre un singur proprietar
6560386 aceasta miscare este foarte aproape de liberalizarea completa a pietei fata de investitorii straini
6560387 acest contract de intretinere va ajuta la consolidarea pozitiei companiei bombardier ca si lider de piata in cadrul programului complet de transport feroviar de mare viteza implementat in spania unul dintre cele mai avansate din lune
6560388 exista o multitudine de factori geopolitici ce actioneaza pe fundal

6560466 gesti n estrat gica para ser y parecer una empresa ecol gicamente sustentable
6560467 todo comenz en 1994 cuando un importante cliente de california le pregunt al fundador de interfaceflor qu hac a su empresa por el medio ambiente al no saber qu responder ste comenz a interesarse por ampliar sus conocimientos sobre el tema tomando conciencia de que todos los da os industriales provocan un enorme impacto ambiental a partir de ello decidi que interfaceflor ser a una empresa verde y que s lo vender a productos verdes
6560468 desde 1996 momento en que implementamos una pol tica empresarial inclinada al desarrollo sustentable redujimos las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero en un 72 por ciento el consumo de agua en un 93 por ciento y el de energ a en 68 por ciento en poco m s de 10 a os ahorramos 336 millones de d lares
6560469 el calentamiento global terminar derritiendo el casquete polar haciendo subir el nivel del mar y dejando bajo el agua millones de m2 urbanizados
6560470 actualmente todas las empresas quieren constituirse como eco marca pero lanzan mensajes err ticos e imprecisos
6560471 el 54 por ciento de los consumidores perciben que los productos verdes son caros feos complicados y dif ciles de mantener sin embargo declaran que prefieren a aquellas firmas que favorecen el cuidado del medio ambiente y el ahorro energ tico es por esto que las empresas deben pasar de las declaraciones a la acci n y encontrar su propio adn mediante el componente real productos servicios e infraestructura responsables con el medio ambiente el imaginario posicionamiento y reputaci n y el simb lico ligado a la identidad corporativa es el momento adecuado para que las marcas comprendan que lo verde vende

6560473 internet doesnt come cheap in nigeria one of the reasons for this is the costs involved in using satellites due to a lack of cable infrastructure most internet traffic in nigeria needs to be routed by satellite via north america and europe
6560474 high speed broadband requires fiber optic cables the situation should however improve as there are a number of projects underway to connect african countries with the rest of the world through undersea cables
6560475 traditional internet service providers are facing increasing competition from internet services offered by mobile operators the introduction of 3g services has enabled many nigerians to access the internet through mobile devices
6560476 while q108 should see the launch of the countrys fifth national mobile operator the growth of fixed wireless services and investor interest in nigerias regional telecoms operators will put added pressure on the national providers to improve their services or risk losing market share to smaller rivals

6560486 that to me is the most striking part about it transmitting 60 watts at 75 percent efficiency over several feet
6560487 the power pack for your laptop isnt that efficient its one of those things thats almost too good to be true

6560492 looked up the translation of nikita filatovs name nikita means inconquerable filat or filatov means god guard inconquerable god guard not a bad name
6560493 he fights with zero defense and welcomes punches to his face with a big smile his warrior spirit is reminiscent to that of his deceased indian warrior heroes crazy horse sitting bull and geronimo
6560494 the 5 hole cbj news and notes 8 19 08
6560495 what id say is that theyre much more aggressive this fighting season than theyve been in the past
6560496 he was respected by his subordinates peers and superiors for his outstanding professionalism operational experience and his competence
6560497 a veteran soldier this was his third tour in afghanistan he was a devoted father who liked to share stories of his children with his colleagues and friends
6560498 he loved his girls and it was very hard for him to go away
6560499 the difference is theyre not holding any of the ground that they attack us on so in the case of an ied strike they will inflict some casualties but they dont control the road they inflicted the casualties on so really the net effect is zero other than it whittles away at our resolve
6560500 our soldiers believe in this mission they know what this is all about
6560501 at the end of the day the taliban are against things theyre not for anything theyre against human rights theyre against education theyre against health care theyre against women theyre just against human decency so if we leave these people if we leave the population of kandahar province in the hands of the taliban we just wont be performing our duty and our soldiers know that
6560502 they were a well trained highly motivated crew and believed in their mission
6560503 are they effective theyre slowing them down will we still see devices in culverts yes
6560504 the only way you can stop an insurgent from doing what an insurgent does is putting a 24 hour watch on the target we cant do that
6560505 because of the irrigation problems and the wet season and all that other stuff theres culverts all over the place for drainage
6560506 part of my life is kept to myself im able to relax and be with my friends those pretty much are the only people who really know the answer to that
6560507 did ravens fans eat paint chips when they were kids
6560508 why did the browns fall short of the playoffs last season
6560509 it is impossible to separate the political from the commercial aspects of that display
6560510 for example the state argues that frazier can sell his shirts without displaying the soldiers names but fraziers product is his message and his customers message
6560511 i checked those schools out but i was born to be a buckeye
6560512 when brown needs defense down low he can go to anderson varejao
6560513 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6560514 i live like a recluse no one knows i exist
6560515 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6560516 it was very brief we spoke for just a few minutes it was like meeting a complete stranger
6560517 huruma is a tough place last january during the elections there was rioting and six people were hacked to death
6560518 weve got to learn to disagree without demonizing each other and we need to restore civility in our civil discourse and thats the goal of the saddleback civil forum
6560519 the plane was rocking back and forth until i suspected it was going to fall
6560520 i saw people smoke explosions i think that is what woke me up because i had lost consciousness
6560521 i thought that if help did not arrive soon i would die
6560522 the plane would not fail to the point of causing a tragedy
6560523 most likely whatever the malfunction of the probe was it is probably not related to what happened
6560524 mom who is he she and how do you know them

6560529 i hope that she will really consult with a lot of people talk to a lot of people because to a certain extent in the last couple years we sort of threw up our hands and said what the hells the use
6560530 those are all problems affecting seniors and until now there hasnt been any systematic investigation into these issues
6560531 we hope she will spend a lot of time with us
6560532 in assisted and complex care facilities the level of care should be approximately 3 4 3 5 hours per senior per day well right now its only about 2 1 hours
6560533 what happens is people dont have their beds made or there are many instances where they have problems with their bowel movements and these things arent changed for hours at a time
6560534 seniors are part of a generation that had to do without and overcome adversity so they may be less inclined to complain
6560535 while headline inflation picked up on the month this mornings report shows little evidence of these higher prices filtering through to core inflation
6560536 looking ahead it appears as though the worst may be behind us
6560537 while headline inflation is now running at its fastest pace in more than five years it is still near the bottom of the pack globally and more than two points below the current u s pace
6560538 look for the headline readings to hang around three per cent for some time yet while core looks poised to grind higher as the loonie at par discounts begin to fade out of the calculation later this year
6560539 whether inflation is or isnt a problem in canada depends on which number you look to for an answer
6560540 if you dont drive dont have a mortgage payment and dont eat fresh produce youre in luck conveniently the bank of canada strips out many of the fastest rising categories from its core cpi measure but the typical canadian has all of those costs
6560541 for those of us who dont believe that oil grain and import prices are down for the count inflation is still a looming threat
6560542 its hard to get too excited about the prospect that the bank of canada will ease the policy rate any time soon
6560543 the applicant should not be extradited to the united states before midnight on 29 august
6560544 it is clear that those who are rich and white will continue to be treated differently to those who are poor

6560620 es para proteger a los musulmanes pobres de los cristianos ricos que les compran sus rganos y al rev s
6560621 impedir cualquier intento de enga ar a los enfermos y robarles sus rganos sobre todo si ocurre entre cristianos y musulmanes porque en este caso s abre la puerta a una crisis entre ambas comunidades
6560622 todos tenemos la misma sangre egipcia y si el motivo de la medida es prohibir el tr fico de rganos lo rechazamos porque puede ocurrir tambi n entre fieles de la misma religi n
6560623 tenemos miedo a que en el futuro haya hospitales para cristianos y otros para musulmanes
6560624 instigar a la discriminaci n entre un musulm n y un cristiano que viven en el mismo pa s
6560625 weve been anticipating that providers like at amp t are going to offer in home support simply because theyre going to get the call anyway
6560626 the service provider is going to have to take more and more responsibility or else a the service doesnt work or b theyll get the calls to their customer support anyway
6560627 i see it more that this is in anticipation of having the capability of what they need because without it they wont be able to keep their subscribers happy

6560630 were just glad to see that so many people came and are having a great time
6560631 we actually ended up adding two more pits than we thought wed have just because the response has been so great said jim
6560632 we really wanted to do this tournament differently than others and thats how we settled on the combination of horseshoes and wiffle ball quinny loved soccer but theres a lot of that in the summer tournaments already so we switched it a up a little bit
6560633 theres just something about throwing shoes its summer the way its supposed to be
6560634 this is great why dont we have more of these in jersey
6560635 you would always know where quinny was during a tournament
6560636 words can not express how much we miss him here were all shook up
6560637 everybody who comes in asks about him everybody loved matt
6560638 in my 18 years at rizzo pal there have only been a handful of kids who have left an awesome impression on me matt was truly one of them
6560639 he was energetic in everything he did at pal and that smile wow ill never forget his leadership and outstanding play in winning the pal citywide soccer championship
6560640 mitch daniels false claims of success are a disservice to the people of indiana we have seen jobs and revenues disappear from the state at the hands of daniels misguided decisions
6560641 mitch daniels continues to be out of touch with the struggles of working hoosiers he claimed to be aiming higher in indiana but what he has shown us is his unswerving dedication to sending hoosier jobs and dollars out of the state
6560642 indianas economy is suffering under the misguided decisions of the daniels administration privatization and outsourcing jobs are not answers to rebuild the hoosier economy and help working families
6560643 campaign talking points cannot cover up his dismal economic record this just shows the voters of indiana that their governor is more concerned about his own reputation than the people he serves
6560644 such an eclectic group of people different cultures different styles in nebraska we dont get clothes from europe we get wranglers
6560645 pal is for all kids in philadelphia its more than just a sports program
6560646 i loved working in port richmond the people there are good hardworking people that really cared about the community
6560647 being only 11 months young and having never done the philly hotlist before it would be very nice to finish with a top spot in the ranking and the friendly vibe of a locally owned gym along with the amenities of a first class fitness facility i think gives us an appeal that spans the best of both worlds
6560648 the environment of the fitness club is going to have a lot to do with the success of the trainer the friendlier a club is and the less the trainers have to worry about meeting certain sales quotas the more motivated the clients will be because the trainer client relationship will be that much stronger thats what is great about being a private non corporate gym like city fitness
6560649 not only does city fitness have the best equipment and instructors but it has the best atmosphere i have belonged to a lot of different gyms over the years but this one just feels right everyone is friendly and supportive
6560650 city fitness is the best fitness club i have been to the city big clean and friendly great classes and lots of equipment i never have to wait for cardio equipment all of which have the tvs and audio jacks which keeps me doing my cardio longer classes rock as well the staff is friendly and the trainers helped me get fit and keep me fit i love the club and wish they had a lifetime membership

6560667 this will be fun i will just sit back and watch people most of the time people show off and brag that they know their beer but its at times like this that they are put to the real test
6560668 take away the name and you take away a lot
6560669 we will have 11 different styles running through each of the taps we have specifically chosen most of the popular brands to make it easy however beware that we do have some that are not so popular and only those people who know their beer for real will be able to identify them
6560670 we had to hunt down some of the beers and make special arrangements to get them
6560671 if i were to walk into a bar which had the same kind of people i would be bored as hell however if i walk into a bar that has a good mix of people a kind of social diversity thats magic like lightning in a bottle a bar truly defines the word community a person should feel comfortable in the bar and enjoy the atmosphere and the people the bar business is all about friendliness and community building
6560672 if i was to tell you this case has historical importance id probably be understating the circumstances
6560673 the government is asking you to dictate to every young man in battle that you better be right better be certain or we will second guess you years after the fact
6560674 in the fighting in fallujah the marines were to hold the moral high ground do the right thing
6560675 the defendant did not show the courage or commitment that the marines required im asking you to do the hard thing and find the defendant guilty of what he did on nov 9 2004
6560676 they were sitting on the floor unarmed submissive and docile
6560677 who else wants to do these guys cause i dont want to do it all myself
6560678 every marine is taught to do the right thing at boot camp infantry school again and again before deployment

6560683 i spotted joe quickly but he was trying to hide from the crowds by tucking in between a few people
6560684 he was wearing a baseball cap and real casual dress so he wouldnt stand out
6560685 he watched only her performance then walked backstage to the meet and greet area
6560686 but when he saw people start to recognize him he hid it was real obvious he didnt want people to know he was there to see taylor
6560687 shes a great girl i think anybody would love to go on a date with her
6560688 they are friends and shes friends with all the jonas brothers

6560694 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
6560695 made the battered commodity complex an attractive parking place for money for the moment
6560696 theres no up side to being adversarial in these kind of deals youve just got to stay positive and youve got to focus on whos here and have trust and faith in the people that are working on getting everything done
6560697 no one gets 100 percent of what they would like to happen but me and my agent are happy
6560698 of course there were heated debates on the phone but no one attacked publicly i still feel the same way about this organization as i did last year the last game of the season
6560699 when youre talking about this kind of money a lot of people cant really understand why would you turn your back on a contract business is business
6560700 its more the conditioning factor of starting and stopping and getting in the huddle and doing all that we have plans to do some extra things with him even when were not practicing
6560701 taking a lot of hits you never know if you can jeopardize it
6560702 the only safe bet to not signing a new deal right away is staying out of harms way
6560703 some people dont agree and some people do agree and thats just what it boils down to during a holdout before i made the decision to hold out i took that into consideration
6560704 the bottom line is that air gun noise from seismic surveys that are thousands of yards distant does not drive away sperm whales living in the gulf
6560705 the study has greatly contributed to our knowledge of sperm whales but its also raised new questions we need to know more about such as their feeding and breeding patterns
6560706 theres still a lot we dont know about these huge creatures
6560707 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6560708 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6560709 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6560710 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6560711 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6560712 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6560713 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6560714 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6560715 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6560716 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6560717 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6560718 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6560719 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6560720 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6560721 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6560722 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6560723 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6560724 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6560725 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6560726 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6560727 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6560728 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6560729 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6560730 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6560731 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6560732 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6560733 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6560734 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6560735 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6560736 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6560737 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6560738 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6560739 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6560740 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6560741 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6560742 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6560743 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6560744 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6560745 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6560746 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6560747 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6560748 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6560749 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6560750 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6560751 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6560752 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6560753 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6560754 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
6560755 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6560756 mr ayers is a 60 plus year old individual who lives in my neighborhood who did something that i deplore 40 years ago when i was 6 or 7 years old
6560757 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6560758 beyond the speeches how much do you know about barack obama consider this united 93 never hit the capitol on 9 11 but the capitol was bombed thirty years before by an american terrorist group called weather underground that declared war on the u s targeting the capitol the pentagon police stations and more one of the groups leaders william ayers admits to the bombings proudly saying later some members of the group ayers founded even went on to kill police but barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama american issues project is responsible for the content of this ad
6560759 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6560760 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6560761 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6560762 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6560763 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6560764 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6560765 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6560766 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6560767 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6560768 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6560769 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6560770 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

6560774 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6560775 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6560776 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6560777 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6560778 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6560779 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6560780 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6560781 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6560782 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6560783 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6560784 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6560785 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6560786 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6560787 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6560788 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6560789 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6560790 democrats have all the advantages on the macro elements the direction of the country the mood toward the president the sense of change

6560805 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado

6560815 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6560816 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6560817 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6560818 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6560819 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6560820 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6560821 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6560822 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6560823 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6560824 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6560825 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6560826 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
6560827 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
6560828 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6560829 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6560830 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6560831 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6560832 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6560833 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6560834 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6560835 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6560836 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6560837 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6560838 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6560839 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6560840 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6560841 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6560842 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6560843 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6560844 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6560845 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6560846 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6560847 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
6560848 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6560849 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6560850 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6560851 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6560852 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6560853 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6560854 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6560855 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6560856 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6560857 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas
6560858 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
6560859 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6560860 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6560861 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6560862 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6560863 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6560864 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6560865 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6560866 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6560867 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6560868 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6560869 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6560870 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6560871 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6560872 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6560873 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6560874 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6560875 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6560876 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6560877 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6560878 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6560879 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6560880 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6560881 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6560882 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6560883 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6560884 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6560885 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6560886 its a dog okay you can get another one relax
6560887 we do not condone what the officer said it was inappropriate and insensitive
6560888 all three reports tend to indicate that were bottoming out but that there is no real end in sight and thats what i think the market has to get used to
6560889 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6560890 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6560891 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6560892 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6560893 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6560894 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6560895 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6560896 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6560897 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6560898 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6560899 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6560900 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6560901 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6560902 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6560903 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6560904 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6560905 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6560906 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6560907 este tipo de felicitaciones nos enorgullece y motiva a seguir avanzando pese a una serie de desaf os y limitaciones no obstante nuestro nico fin es optimizar el servicio de atenci n en la instituci n y para conseguirlo debemos erradicar los tr mites innecesarios y dar paso al acceso a la informaci n de la ciudadan a
6560908 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
6560909 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
6560910 the nato airstrikes that were supposed to allow the soldiers under assault to get out of the trap according to the wounded missed their target and hit french soldiers along with other shots fired from afghan soldiers positioned below
6560911 were the victims of an extremely well prepared and murderous ambush we should not look here and there for other causes
6560912 the planes supplying close air support could not engage because french troops were very close to taliban insurgents and if they had engaged there may have been considerable collateral damage if the bombs had been used
6560913 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or injured were consistent with air delivered ordnance
6560914 we have these fake queues at front of 20 stores around the country to drum up interest in the iphone
6560915 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
6560916 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
6560917 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
6560918 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
6560919 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
6560920 you couldnt distinguish that there was an aircraft there apart from the remains of the tail if you didnt know it you wouldnt have been able to say there was a plane
6560921 one of them seems to be a little bit damaged but investigators are confident they could use the information
6560922 but we have to wait for the downloading and the analysis
6560923 the heating problem was treated and corrected by spanair maintenance personnel
6560924 the fault was isolated and the aircraft was dispatched for flight
6560925 we have reviewed the details on this faulty situation with the inspectors of our civil aviation authority and we all come to the conclusion that was nothing abnormal in this resolution of that problem
6560926 she said they could see the fire and then it was not even a minute or so they heard something blow up
6560927 they were about 200 meters in the air and then they were landing but not crashing they were landing like little by little it was not like they fell down suddenly
6560928 the government will do all it can to support the families in this difficult situation
6560929 the whole government logically is affected very affected as are all spanish citizens by this tragedy
6560930 i said the heck is that and there was an alligator floating by

6560937 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
6560938 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6560939 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6560940 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6560941 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6560942 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6560943 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what john mccain stands for and believes in
6560944 theres no way in hell im voting for the old establishment
6560945 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
6560946 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
6560947 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
6560948 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
6560949 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
6560950 were not going to let russia so soon after the iron curtain fell to again draw a dividing line across europe
6560951 the g 8 should become for a while the g 7 until russia proves that it is capable of being a law abiding member of the international community
6560952 the russians are hell bent on recapturing some of the territory that they believe is rightfully theirs that now is in the hands of people indigenous to the area who are embracing freedom and democracy
6560953 the only way to end the war is the withdrawal of foreign troops as part of a political settlement negotiated with all the significant players in the country including the taliban and guaranteed by the regional powers and neighbouring states
6560954 prices of essential commodities which include food grains pulses edible oils vegetables dairy products kerosene soap and safety matches have more or less stabilised
6560955 however out of 98 articles 17 articles have shown a decline in prices as compared to august 2 2008 these included rice maize urad and arhar sunflower linseed and niger seed raw rubber cotton potatoes eggs dry chillies and eggs another 56 articles have shown no increase in prices
6560956 inflation may have peaked there is some softening in commodity prices rice and wheat production is expected to be good although pulses may see some pressure a possibility of rate hike by 25 bps is not ruled out but now the task of balancing between inflation and growth will be tough
6560957 the rise in inflation was in line with expectation it may rise further on account of the base effect and then come down however some surprises because of the failure in catching data on time could play the spoil sport further monetary tightening is not completely ruled out but when globally central banks are going in for expansionary stance it would be difficult to go in for contradictory policy now
6560958 the americans have dominated in the past but this olympics has been a jamaican olympics

6560960 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6560961 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6560962 it was that fighting spirit that allowed stephanie to rise from modest beginnings to succeed in public service to become a one woman force for progress in our country
6560963 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6560964 she worked so hard and gave everything she could im devastated wherever wed go wed speak of each other as brother and sister its an incalculable loss

6560977 while headline inflation picked up on the month this mornings report shows little evidence of these higher prices filtering through to core inflation
6560978 looking ahead it appears as though the worst may be behind us
6560979 while headline inflation is now running at its fastest pace in more than five years it is still near the bottom of the pack globally and more than two points below the current u s pace
6560980 look for the headline readings to hang around three per cent for some time yet while core looks poised to grind higher as the loonie at par discounts begin to fade out of the calculation later this year
6560981 it all just kind of came together for them and for us and it was just a really great connection

6560986 what many of us on the market are concerned about is how good a job theyre going to do maintaining their current market share

6560992 we have 90 days to seek review from the supreme court
6560993 if you look at the number of investments you have to imagine that there are 10 times that number of firms who have looked or thought of it just like the number of home buyers who look at a house
6560994 weve had folks from china and japan visit the oilsands in previous years and now weve had some very high profile wealthy people form the u s to go and take a look
6560995 the visit may be somewhat symbolic in a way but i dont expect warren buffett or bill gates to go out and start buying oilsands companies at this point i think theyre just going up there to kick the tires and see what its all about
6560996 wed be very surprised if this was a precursor to a major investment on their part especially on the part of warren buffett
6560997 he looks to invest in companies at the bottom of the cycle and theres no reason to believe that were at the bottom of the current commodity price cycle
6560998 people are finally realizing that this russian situation has the potential to be bad for a very long time

6561009 a team of policemen in mufti came to the college campus on thursday and went through the records of some former and current medical students
6561010 we feel we have been able to break the ice and are hopeful that something positive will come up by friday
6561011 this is an exciting time as all of you know this is not the best of times financially for anybody and everyone is certainly looking for any type of help they can get one of our most distinguished alums and certainly one of our best basketball players mr penny hardaway has informed us that he wants to help and he wants to do something thats pretty significant for us and our school
6561012 we have said repeatedly that what we are trying to do at the athletic department we are trying to do with class dignity and style if anybody personifies that its penny hardaway with what penny is doing today he will become our 34th ambassador which is unbelievable and we appreciate it additionally we will unveil our hall of fame with this donation we have decided to name the hall of fame after penny hardaway

6561014 to be able to go here go to college dr thomas carpenter allowed me to have the opportunity to come here to have a great career to play with so many great teammates have great fans and great coaches and to be able to live out a dream and come back and do something like this for the school its priceless for me little kids that grow up in neighborhoods where people tell you that you cant do things well a lot of people told me that i couldnt do things and i didnt listen to them i kept my dreams high and my goals high and i accomplished a lot of things that a lot people didnt think that i was going to be able to accomplish so im so thankful for that and to be able to give back to the school and to the program is something that im so glad that im able to do

6561050 reports that actor jean reno is in the hospital due to a heart attack are false he is vacationing in the caribbean and went to a local hospital as a precaution for some discomfort he was feeling due to heartburn and gastroenteritis
6561051 it was definitely not a heart attack he is fine and healthy and enjoying the rest of his vacation travelling in the caribbean
6561052 i think he was just enjoying vacation and probably ate a little too much spicy caribbean food
6561053 we have nothing but big fights left for the rest of the year but this is so crazy because there are so many of them
6561054 were going to have a retreat on monday to figure this all out
6561055 both have come through the week and done well so theyll only get better with another outing
6561056 rocky is an influential inspirational player because he does intimidate and blokes alongside him tend to respond to that
6561057 its good to have him back and he certainly didnt enjoy watching the last outing the loss to the all blacks in auckland hopefully he will bring some of that grumpiness with him
6561058 its not a reflection of ranking and the volume of game time for the two players will not change
6561059 it is just the order we will be using this week and well be looking for matt to put the afterburners on al has performed really well this year and we know he is capable of going the distance
6561060 matt doesnt have the same volume of game time under his belt but he will be an asset as it will be dry and it is going to be fast
6561061 i really dont try to think too much about footy because there is a trap in over complicating things
6561062 it is just a game after all you just go out there and do what you have to do at the best of your ability and thats all ive been trying to do
6561063 every player has a disappointment in their career and not going to the world cup last year was mine
6561064 i then wasnt happy with my form in the arc australian rugby championship and so i thought to myself its now or never i decided it was time for me to really step up
6561065 i tended to have brain snaps where i did something stupid which at the time i thought was a good idea but when you look back you realise it wasnt
6561066 thats something ive worked pretty hard on to eradicate i began telling myself if it seems stupid at the time its probably not a good idea to do it
6561067 democratic candidate just doesnt care if gas prices go up to five or even six dollars a gallon he even voted against new laws that would allow for name of absurd and idiotic oil exploration plan that wont in reality lower gas prices a plugged nickel doesnt democratic candidate even realize how much hes hurting working families
6561068 the average officer thinks that if theyre constantly on the move theyre doing a better job of preventing an incident from occurring
6561069 candidly some of them have said well gee you know its hot out there well if you go in that store youll cool off youll get to know the manager and youll get your presence known weve had to educate them as to the benefits
6561070 ive always had a theory that one of the greatest inventions was police cars because it made us more mobile
6561071 and one of the worst inventions was air conditioning because we rolled our windows up
6561072 it is more of a lets see what happens there are no guarantees
6561073 every pub has to change their prices and this came in the middle of the change
6561074 we know that war service can have both a physical and mental impact on the lives of service personnel physical impairment can be obvious psychological injury is less so
6561075 this government is determined to support veterans and ex service personnel who may suffer psychologically as a result of their service however to do so we need a better understanding of the incidence and characteristics of suicide amongst this community
6561076 we are seeking to better identify those at risk common contributing factors in recent cases the incidence of suicide in the ex service community and whether there is more that government agencies and the medical and allied health professions can do to support veterans under stress
6561077 it was a cigarette case that hitler had given her with a diamond swastika on the top
6561078 i said thats gotta be worth a lot of money and she came out with this revelation when i looked at the history research she had parties where she entertained hitler so she was like a social hostess
6561079 she hated her first husband because he was so domineering i think she was ashamed she hated hitler and didnt really want to talk about the tryst once it was out there
6561080 i think she reluctantly told me because i asked about the cigarette case and immediately regretted it
6561081 she said that she tried to tell movie mogul louis b meyer about hitler and he said he didnt want to talk about hitler and he told her not to talk about hitler i bet she didnt tell anyone except me
6561082 i knew jeremy briefly i saw him maybe four or five times socially i didnt really know him well
6561083 he blake was a friend and so i read the thing script and liked it
6561084 but id been offered everything from a high fidelity to a john waters film and i just turned it all down
6561085 we never met to discuss the film i did explain to her i wasnt looking to act right then and with the album tour schedule and a baby on the way it wouldnt be feasible
6561086 my father was doing scientology in the 60s so its something that has been around for most of my life
6561087 i remember doing it with webcke after training hes the hardest bloke ive ever tackled
6561088 i used to go out every friday and try and knock him over hed just stand there off two steps and block me and id fall on my arse that was about it but hes made of granite that bloke
6561089 i was guilty against the all blacks i fell off a few tackles and i was pretty dirty at myself so i dont want that to happen next game so i take pride in the defence and its got to be up there again
6561090 i imagine theyll probably chop and change a little bit there
6561091 de villiers is a very smart sort of player hes pretty nifty and he sort of controls their backline so as a 12 you have to be pretty on your toes to look after him because he obviously along with butch james controls where theyre destined to go in the backline
6561092 what is he six three or six four almost but hes quick too thats the other thing that you often dont see
6561093 im pretty stoked to be here and i dont take it for granted thats for sure
6561094 but the real reason for me coming across here was to play in different countries and to get that opportunity i think thats the greatest thing that rugby offers
6561095 he will need to take some stock hell need a couple of weeks
6561096 the plan is for him to take stock mentally and otherwise and i have advised him he needs to get back onto the field as soon as he can
6561097 we have been caught by surprise as to how quickly our situation has become public
6561098 it is with regret that i confirm todays media reports are correct and that liz and i have decided to separate
6561099 given the personal nature of the matter i ask that you please respect our privacy as we attempt to deal with this sensitive situation
6561100 i am like everyone else in australia and just want to see brett back as soon as possible he is a very important member of the side
6561101 incredibly excited and pleased for the athletes that have done well
6561102 if we dont put more money in we are going to go backwards because the rest of the world is putting more in even if we keep investing we are probably only going to be treading water
6561103 swimming had it tough but i am sure we are all incredibly proud of what moss burmester did in the phelps race in which he finished fourth on a different day
6561104 i think they have been a little bit unlucky if they had been able to keep the spaniards out for the last seven seconds spain scored with seconds to go to win 1 0 they could have gone right through i guess we are going to have to sit down with hockey and review how it went i think it is a talented team and its results dos not reflect that talent
6561105 that demonstrates you have to be in this environment to taste it to know what it is like

6561109 we have been made aware of a security breach at the offices of an external contractor involving the loss of personal information about offenders in england and wales
6561110 a full investigation is being conducted police and the information commissioner have been informed
6561111 what is more scandalous is that it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data rendering them unfit to be charged with protecting our safety
6561112 which hasnt been officially announced it will be released in 2010
6561113 speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues
6561114 the drivers should have gotten together like a normal school day whether that was monday or last week
6561115 they should have run their routes and stopped at every house to make sure it would work
6561116 given our geographical difficulties it just led to a domino effect of delays leading to some students being over 2 hours on the bus
6561117 were using a better coding system and articulating that to the buildings
6561118 so that we know how to better prepare students to load the buses in the afternoon
6561119 hey man you ever think about what the sound between the notes sounds like
6561120 anything that comes out of the south is going to be called grotesque by the northern reader unless it is grotesque in which case it is going to be called realistic
6561121 which of these names is not like the other ones
6561122 the barack obama and john mccain campaigns have agreed to hold three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate in september and october sponsored by the commission on presidential debates the campaigns have come to the earliest agreement on presidential debates reached in any general election in recent history this announcement reflects the presidential campaigns agreement on dates locations and the formats for the fall debates campaign appointed debate negotiators house democratic caucus chairman rahm emanuel d il and senator lindsey graham r sc said they were pleased to have reached an early agreement to provide the american people with the opportunity to see and hear the candidates debate the critical issues facing the country the two campaigns have accepted sponsorship of the debates by the commission on presidential debates subject to the debates being conducted under the terms of their agreement
6561123 focus on their jobs without the distraction of contractual disputes
6561124 i agree with the mayor the best place to get a contract is at the bargaining table
6561125 im sure well find something to fight about in the future thats what i do for a living
6561126 could it be that she doesnt shut up it just seems to me that edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than just talk
6561127 amid the verdant lawn and leafy trees of the tidy jefferson senior high school campus a police officer patrols the grounds and a sign warns that guns are illegal gang members frequently disrupt class and teachers spend much of their time dealing with troublemakers the biggest problem here however may be what you dont see all the dropouts with a 58 percent dropout rate jefferson has the worst dropout record in the los angeles unified school district the nations second largest while half the students typically quit inner city schools nationwide jefferson is at the lower end of the spectrum of so called dropout factories because of a concentration of factors that are rarely all present at schools in other cities a quarter century ago latino students totaled 31 percent of the student body now they account for almost 90 percent blacks comprise about 10 percent and a sliver are asian or white

6561134 if they fail to reinstate the judges well have countrywide sit ins and block road and rail traffic youll see that well call for a pakistan bandh
6561135 we had hoped the judges would be restored after the government was formed but that didnt happen
6561136 the skepticism derives from the governments failure to fulfill their commitment even after four months but their reiteration inspires some confidence now the leadership cant afford to violate this now
6561137 i can opt out of the leadership of our movement but cant leave the party
6561138 i am a member of ppps central executive committee that why i pursue benazir bhuttos idea when she stormed the barricades outside the chief justices residence in 2007 she said iftikhar muhammad chaudhry was still the chief justice of pakistan and will be reinstated as soon as ppp was voted to power i also pursue the commitment made by asif ali zardari this year to reinstate every judge immediately
6561139 right now ppp appears to be dragging its feet on this and has lost public support
6561140 their reiteration is now more emphatic and credible although its still not a victory of the lawyers movement

6561149 the 2008 beijing games have put an end once and for all to the notion that these olympics are a force for good
6561150 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
6561151 we believe the games are going to move ahead the agenda of the social and human rights as far as possible the games are going to be a force for good

6561154 im very interested in social stratification and the role that housing plays in that by reinforcing and revealing class
6561155 we act out our social positions individually and home is often the place we do that
6561156 most americans think they are middle class and that everyone else is middle class as well what they forget is that there are a lot of people with no car garages who rely on the bus to get to work
6561157 it looks at home in so many ways the water sources the geography the areas farming history and the developers who put the place together after world war ii
6561158 a lot of cultural critics say the inflation of house size is about insecurity around social position
6561159 for a lot of people their identity is tied up in the kind of house they have and so they overspend they over invest in their home because they think it says who they are
6561160 theres more space in the home dedicated to work than there was 20 years ago
6561161 the automobile suburbs as weve built them are unsustainable for the long term
6561162 and weve known that for 30 years i think were going to find creative ways to make the suburbs work by splitting large houses in half and making duplexes out of them
6561163 how small could a house be and still be fully functioning
6561164 the decedent did not have a history of chronic drug abuse
6561165 were going to have 15 000 journalists from all over the world in colorado that is more than are at the olympics right now we want them to see what we already know we have a vibrant downtown that this is an exciting place we want them to really get a sense of what it is that makes denver so special and who knows so people watching in new york or l a may say maybe we should have an office in denver
6561166 all the information we have suggests its not going to be a serious problem at all the most recent numbers suggest less and less and less protestors there are some folks out there that want to cause a disturbance therell be a few of them well take care of it i dont see it as being a significant problem we have planned for any eventuality no matter what happens i think we have contingencies plans in place but we dont expect it to serious at all
6561167 its been almost two years weve been planning this thing all of our different agencies the public works police departments parks and recreation have all come together in just an incredible way its just a remarkable team we have

6561223 brazil played a great match but we were able to improve and get stronger as the minutes went by
6561224 i told my players that they should believe in their own ability and in themselves that they should hold onto the ball in midfield and find the right tempo they did just that and here we are
6561225 i cant even recall the saves or how it happened but all i know is that i was playing with a different energy tonight and it just felt so good
6561226 i dont even think about that whatever i said last year im just enjoying this moment right now i feel great i just won a damn gold medal
6561227 when i was a child i wasnt allowed to play football because i was a girl and here i am today looking at this gold medal im very proud and thrilled with this victory

6561237 he is not a conservative candidate on other issues im not sure that would be a wise choice
6561238 with the good feelings there is going to be a lot of public support for continuing the policy of winning gold medals
6561239 the decision might have to go into the top leadership of china
6561240 the chinese program really pares down athletes to whether or not they can win a gold medal
6561241 once theyre zeroed in on a couple of people they put everything into these people
6561242 is a different kind of program that were not used to
6561243 the other ones came from just picking off medals here and there
6561244 when they start taking some of our swimming medals away from us its going to be difficult to compete
6561245 the strategic move places the highly anticipated james bond adventure one week closer to the prime movie going holiday window and takes advantage of last weeks decision to move the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince
6561246 we saw the film recently in london and marc forster daniel craig and the entire team at eon have truly delivered another extraordinary bond adventure
6561247 quantum of solace is a seamless continuation of the storyline that began with the last film we believe november 14th is a great date that allows us to play straight through thanksgiving and right into christmas the bond films have a long history of entertaining audiences in this holiday corridor going back to goldeneye in 1995 the studio enjoyed tremendous success opening casino royale in north america on november 17 2006 and we believe this decision will give the public a wider opportunity to see the film over the holiday
6561248 today the federal district court granted a stay of execution in the case of jeff wood to allow the court to consider compelling evidence that jeff wood is too mentally ill to be executed
6561249 held that the texas state courts have not carefully reviewed the question of woods competence and that a stay of execution is necessary to ensure that woods mental health issues are fully presented and considered by the courts
6561250 at reneaus trial the prosecution had argued that reneau was the person chiefly responsible for the crime and that woods role was secondary
6561251 a delusional system an inability to grasp the reality surrounding the issues specific to this case his role in it in the crime
6561252 if a person is only mentally ill and not incompetent the decisions are less clear and are up to individual judgments by the governor or the jury
6561253 mr wood suffers today from the same psychological and emotional impairments for which a jury found him incompetent to stand trial in 1997
6561254 he has never received psychiatric or mental health care for these impairments
6561255 because of his longstanding mental illness that allowed him to be easily manipulated by the principal actor daniel reneau
6561256 we have been doing a lot of original reporting and we are going to be doing a lot more

6561258 our aim is to reach these bigger names and use our reporting talent to break news we are really going for the kinds of questions that will make news
6561259 we really are paying a lot of attention to what our audience wants

6561267 on his swing through the midwest and mountain west senator obama will continue to highlight his commitment to bringing change to washington and offering relief to middle class families who are increasingly burdened by the tightening economy and high gas prices
6561268 lets see weve got the big condo in phoenix the ranch in sedona arlington
6561269 john mccain never said he didnt know how many houses he and mrs mccain have
6561270 that is clear he referred the questioners to his staff because this is a question that has been debated at the staff level with some reporters who based on an inaccurate reading of senate disclosure forms have reported more homes than the mccains actually own and some press reports that have indicated fewer homes than they actually own so by trying to avoid a debate about the holdings of the hensley family trust he simply attempted to move on to the next question
6561271 their belief that it was proper to have slavery and hold african americans in bondage
6561272 democrats have largely taken that same position in unborn human life that an unborn human is really just disposable property to do with as one wishes african americans were the victims of this disposable property ideology a century and a half ago and still are today for over a century and a half democrats have wrongly argued that some human life is merely disposable personal property and black americans have suffered most under this philosophy
6561273 so sanitized of historical reality it makes stalin look like historian david mccullough
6561274 democrats have done in the past and are doing now to black people they are keeping blacks in virtual slavery
6561275 you start out in 1954 by saying nigger nigger nigger
6561276 by 1968 you cant say nigger that hurts you backfires so you say stuff like forced busing states rights and all that stuff youre getting so abstract now that youre talking about cutting taxes and all these things youre talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is that blacks get hurt worse than whites

6561287 what i have seen today is stalingrad it is complete destruction
6561288 if not for the help of great russia there would have been even more numerous casualties here
6561289 for the ossetian people after the beslan tragedy to lose 2 000 more people is a terrible loss a terrible loss
6561290 only here thanks to this music i feel the fear leaving
6561291 i feel that life is returning to tskhinvali and the music helps me forget the horrors of the bombardment that i went through
6561292 music has reminded me that life is not only war

6561303 kicking whether it be for points territory or tactical reasons needs to be practised and i cant think of many better in the field than matt burke
6561304 matts one of the greatest players ever to pull on a waratahs jersey so hell command a huge amount of respect amongst the playing squad

6561317 what we now see is some idea within the fiji interim government that they can get a new constitution without any proper process
6561318 i dont think there is anything inherently bad about fijis constitution or electoral laws
6561319 the point is the commodore has decided he doesnt like it its no way to change a countrys fundamental laws like electoral law just because a person decides he doesnt like it

6561412 but instead of coming together in one place such as the national mall we are going to go talk to people where they live when the next congress is seated early next year we want one million people to remind them that americans strongly oppose this war and its time to responsibly end it
6561413 the antiwar sentiment throughout the country has never been stronger to help bring greater visibility to the depth of opposition to the war in iraq on sept 20th the million doors for peace project will put thousands of people out on the streets in communities in all 50 states this massive national mobilization will send a clear message it is time to bring all the troops home
6561414 million doors for peace takes the anti war movement in a new direction
6561415 each year during the iraq war we have seen large anti war demonstrations in washington and around the country this year the tactics and strategy are different instead of gathering in one place we will be in every state in the country we will meet people on their front door steps in order to expand the anti war constituency in this country and remind our leaders of americas anti war sentiment the cost of this war has been too great
6561416 when congress returns next year members will have to answer to constituents determined to bring an end to this seemingly endless war
6561417 too many people have died and precious resources have been squandered while the needs of our communities continue to go unmet
6561418 this research project will greatly enhance our understanding of the exact relationship between dietary distillers grains and e coli 0157 h7 in cattle as well as provide us with an opportunity to look at novel ways to mitigate the potential risks of feeding this valuable co product
6561419 despite care in food processing and provision there is a possibility that food can become contaminated with potentially harmful bacteria
6561420 occasional recalls of potentially contaminated ground beef in recent years are a sign that safety checks are working hamburger lovers do not need to give up their favorite food
6561421 using a meat thermometer is the only sure way to tell if meat is properly cooked
6561422 more and more people are using mobile devices to get things done when traveling while waiting in line and at other so called down times
6561423 so our new accessibility will allow them to check details and plan a cruise wherever they are
6561424 our future rests with our children and we are honored to be recognized for our tireless work on behalf of waiting children
6561425 adoption is one of those issues that cross the partisan divide and we look forward to working with the next administration to streamline the adoption process and secure loving permanent families for every single waiting child in the u s foster care system
6561426 we are truly thankful to our partner spx service solutions for sponsoring this award in honor of an ayes instructor that goes above and beyond
6561427 our instructors are our delivery mechanism and the basis for a strong ayes initiative in our schools throughout the nation
6561428 because of the popularity of luxury hotel chains implementing premium hotel bed programs the trend you are seeing now is boutique hotels getting into the hotel bed business by not only offering the beds in their rooms but making them available to consumers as well
6561429 with the push of a button westminster hotel guests will now be able to customize their sleep experience with hollandia offering not just a hotel stay but a great nights sleep
6561430 hollandia was the natural choice when selecting a luxury sleep system for our guest rooms and suites
6561431 their innovative designs and sleep systems truly set them apart and compliment westminster hotels signature commitment to providing our guests with the highest level of comfort sophistication and service
6561432 we like the idea that hotel guests can come and try our mattress out for an entire night and then decide whether they want to introduce this kind of quality sleep in their own homes no other retailer can allow their customers such an option
6561433 ron and kirk are tremendous additions to our board and we are very pleased and fortunate to have the opportunity to gain from their years of experience across a broad spectrum of healthcare and business disciplines their appointments along with the recent naming of randy thurman as executive chairman serve to further strengthen and diversify our board as we continue to execute our growth strategy and establish cardionets mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry system as the best in class in the arrhythmia monitoring market
6561434 we in the chemical industry are in the business of improving lives through innovation and the nebula catalyst development program is a prime example of what is best about our trade these practicing scientists from different organizations have spent years working together and overcoming technical and economic obstacles to bring a unique and important invention not only to life but also to global commercial success their work has helped albemarle and its customers meet the rising global call for cleaner energy solutions
6561435 we are proud of these scientists and of all of our employees who have worked with the nebula catalyst over the years living out our principles of sustainability in our offices labs and manufacturing sites across the globe
6561436 we are honored by acs to be a part of this award
6561437 once you have the volume mounted for the first time you can format it with any file system you want or if you have advanced applications such as high end database engines you could use it directly
6561438 we see developers using this feature for long term backup purposes for use in rollback strategies for world wide volume re creation purposes
6561439 snapshots also play an important role in building fault tolerance scenarios when combined with managing applications using elastic ip addresses and availability zones
6561440 one of the criticisms of ec2 when it first launched was the inability to run a fast data store across snapshots which made running databases or other data intensive applications slightly more complicated
6561441 the difference between ebs and s3 is that ebs allows block level access so that it can be mounted just like any other local storage device from within ec2 and can be accessed across servers and between instances
6561442 when we began first to preach these things the people appeared as awakened from the sleep of ages they seemed to see for the first time that they were responsible beings
6561443 we have met with families in which for weeks together not an article of sustenance but potatoes had been used yet for every child the hard earned sum was provided to send them to school
6561444 but i saw a man yesterday who knows a fellow who had it from a chappie that said that urquhart had been dipping himself a bit recklessly off the deep end
6561445 all of a sudden we now had a rule book to go by and when we had problems the preacher was right there to give us the answers
6561446 oil stocks had fallen quite sharply during the decline so theres a bit of a relief rally going on right now
6561447 those stocks have been pounded when they consolidated i think you had a lot of shorts that were willing to cover
6561448 talk of a possible lehman takeover was one of the catalysts for the turnaround it looks like there is some bottom fishing going on
6561449 another nail in the coffin for stocks in the near term
6561450 there is no question he has brought in a lot of money and on a personal level i am very sad he has gone because of his legacy as he has pointed out today
6561451 under him wembley opened under him a valuable tv deal was negotiated and i know he is particularly proud of his respect campaign which was overdue
6561452 but the truth is he also put in progress a strategic review ie how should football be run over the next five 10 years
6561453 one of the results of that was to bring in an independent chairman and i believe that once you have an independent chairman the relationship between the chief executive and chairman was bound to change
6561454 i think the question people should be asking is do you need a chief executive of the fa anymore
6561455 would you not be better off having a guy a chairman president him or her who leads the organisation who is elected every four years and can be thrown out after four years if the whole of the game does not want that person who cant serve for longer than two four year terms and who has around them the staff they want
6561456 and then this relationship between the staff and the councillors would be resolved once and for all
6561457 i was for eight years on the boa british olympic association
6561458 my ambition has always been to get a gb football team not just for men but women too into the olympics and we will do it for 2012
6561459 if the scots welsh and irish choose not to take part thats their business but england will be represented both men and women
6561460 the addition of guenther to our team moves us another important step forward in the transformation of our businesses
6561461 he brings a winning attitude to our company and has demonstrated a commitment to enhancing relationships with customers profitable sales growth and navigating through organizational change
6561462 our customers are demanding we add more locations as they continue to tell their friends across the country about the zounds experience especially in central florida
6561463 the technology in all of our z1 hearing aids is continually performing better than hearing aids that cost more than twice as much and many customers have claimed they are the best theyve ever tried which makes everyone at the company feel great
6561464 the concept of luxury travel and the hotel experience that affluent consumers seek has evolved over the years and even now continues to redefine itself
6561465 what remains constant about our best of the best award recipients is their spirited enthusiasm singular passion for delivering an unparalleled experience and an unwavering commitment to serving both the client and our member travel agencies we are proud to recognize those hotels that are stand outs in particular areas of excellence
6561466 the no slip charlie is a super cool product that will help new moms feel just a bit more confident wading into those early baths pair it with a soft baby towel a rubber duck and some baby wash for a really unique and practical baby or shower gift

6561470 nobody has the eagles or the buffalos right now we bought 2 000 ounces late last week and those were the last 2 000 ounces that we can find in the marketplace

6561472 now that callahan is gone we can get back to using all this talent right

6561475 nobody should avoid taking a statin because of concerns about cancer

6561484 no hay mucho apoyo en el deporte en el pa s entrenaba compet a ten a que ir a trabajar y hacer mil cosas no pod a dedicarme exclusivamente al atletismo
6561485 siento que si hubiera estado concentrada en el cdom y me hubieran dado todas las facilidades de las pocas que hay a la mejor hubiera destacada un poco m s en el deporte del atletismo desgraciadamente cuando ya te becan en conade es porque ya sobresaliste ya quieren atletas hechos uno mismo debe salir por sus propios medios

6561498 video killed the spirit and showmanship that movies was all about and turned the mob mentality of a theatrical screened movie into a solitary consumer experience that plays into the arrested development
6561499 esper bamos realmente que fuera en esta semana todav a tenemos jueves y viernes esperemos que en el transcurso de esta semana pero me parece que una vez que ya tom en sus manos el caso el juez nico debi de haberlo resuelto ya me parece tendr amos de plazo la siguiente semana esto retrasar a una o dos semanas m s lo que ten amos calculado que era a mediados de agosto
6561500 aqu quiero aclarar que para m lo que realmente es v lido en caso de que un club quisiera entrar en contacto con un jugador que ya tiene firmado no es dimes y diretes ni quejas de una cosa en particular sino simplemente presentar el contacto vigente de com n acuerdo con la firma del jugador y listo asunto arreglado es algo que ellos hasta la fecha no han hecho es algo que a nosotros nos hace tener cada vez m s no la esperanza sino la convicci n de que hemos actuado bien hemos actuado bien de acuerdo a la ley que impera en fifa y que todos la conocemos debe de haber un acuerdo contractual de com n decisi n tanto del jugador como del club para que sea v lido y ellos no lo han presentado
6561501 a m me parece que es todo lo contrario qui n m s que un primer vicepresidente de fifa que debe de ser el m s ocupado en que se aplique la ley tal cual me parece que eso es clar simo si por alguna raz n que espero que nunca suceda se violentara una ley de la fifa por alguien tan importante realmente estar amos en una situaci n muy criticable no es as yo creo que es todo lo contrario

6561504 as democracy is perfected the office of president represents more and more closely the inner soul of the people on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
6561505 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag carrying a cross
6561506 those who give up liberty for security deserve neither and will lose both
6561507 its important for our fellow citizens to understand when you think patriot act constitutional guarantees are in place when it comes to doing what is necessary to protect our homeland because we value the constitution
6561508 the power of the executive to cast a man into prison without formulating any charge known to the law and particularly to deny him the judgment of his peers is in the highest degree odious and is the foundation of all totalitarian government whether nazi or communist
6561509 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile it is morally treasonable to the american public

6561516 georgia has no other choice people have understood that if it is georgia today attacked by russian forces then tomorrow it could be poland or the czech republic
6561517 georgia was a russian colony for more than 200 years but this is the 21st century the time for colonies is over georgia now has the strong support of the outside world
6561518 the lands of south ossetia and abkhazia are our georgian land the demands of our people for their return are legitimate

6561526 attempts have been made over recent weeks to ease our worst fears in the estimation of this author they have fallen short just let us know
6561527 were mature enough to handle whatever reality might be we deserve the courtesy sen johnson to receive from you not your staff some form of communication to help us know better your condition
6561528 the websters dictionary i use suggests that numerous means something other than one or two photographs i thought that to imply that many had been released at different times wasnt as up front as i would have preferred
6561529 some would say it was misleading one must remember that a statement can be true and still be misleading
6561530 if the trash man doesnt pick up the trash at my house for six months i certainly dont pay the bill at the very least i contact the company and find out what the problem is in johnsons case the company doesnt respond and i cant make other arrangements i still must pay the bill and my garbage is piling up
6561531 talk to somebody who played in the game she didnt play
6561532 i have seen a lone woman drive into a dealership park walk around for a while and finally go up to the receptionist and ask for some assistance i find this curious as women directly influence nearly 75 or more of all car sales to watch trained attack jackals er sales associates virtually ignore her because they believe that she is not the decision maker is almost surreal
6561533 in most deals involving married couples the woman is in charge of the final decision perhaps men instinctively know that we can often become mesmerized by shiny fast moving objects and make poor decisions without the steadying influence of our better halves many of us would be living outdoors under a lean to foraging for sustenance of course we would have some really cool cars women are particularly sensitive to time wastin and bull shootin and being disrespected on top of it all makes enduring a difficult and expensive process that much more grating and demeaning
6561534 is to simply announce loudly that the car is for you you are the only decision maker and you want to buy a car today
6561535 i think he will bend over backward not to give markets much to go on just ask yourself what has happened since the last federal open market committee meeting

6561786 we worked very hard to get the cost as low as possible
6561787 we reduced our wish list and went through a rigorous process to get the project cost down to a level we could afford
6561788 and we stayed in communication with mr hammons throughout the process every time we met mr hammons told me if you need more help to build the kind of arena we want and springfield and the university deserves let me know that point did come and mr hammons committed the additional 5 million to make this dream a reality the new budget is 67 million one of my goals is to find ways to have for our students and faculty the level of facilities they deserve if the lewis and clark initiative is ultimately approved we will dramatically improve our academic and lab space that coupled with the jqh arena and a new recreation center will begin to raise the level of facilities for missouri state university
6561789 its just the pre season lets not get carried away
6561790 el afis de la polic a bonaerense funciona desde 2004 y cuenta en sus registros con las improntas de un mill n y medio de criminales y contraventores
6561791 el sistema es capaz de cotejar y lograr una identificaci n positiva en un lapso que va de los 20 segundos a un par de horas dependiendo de la calidad de las muestras recolectadas
6561792 the stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6561793 the raw data suggest a two to three fold excess of schizophrenia in the cohort born in january 1968 whose mothers would have been in the second month of pregnancy in june 1967
6561794 the population of jerusalem would have been most stressed during the three days of bombardment on june 5 7
6561795 the transition had been tremendously smooth and its clear that were passing an enormous milestone towards reaching uss george washingtons ultimate forward deployment assignment to the western pacific and indian oceans
6561796 we are particularly excited to foster a new era in our long standing relationship with our host nation of japan and the city of yokosuka
6561797 here in beijing chinas athletes have proven themselves to be tough competitors in these olympics
6561798 the first thing they read every day upon logging on
6561799 im just not that kind of gal the only people in real life i can be around every day are my husband and my daughter so its not terribly surprising that i feel the same way about blogs heck even when i got the newspaper delivered i didnt read it daily im just too random for that
6561800 i advise you not to eat any unidentifiable ready to eat meat
6561801 as a proud westerner and candidate for the united states senate it is my honor to take part in this historic convention for change
6561802 in my home state of new mexico and around the nation its clear that voters will have a choice between leaders who will fight for our middle class and do whats right no matter what or those who choose to stand for the same failed policies of the past
6561803 the stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6561804 the raw data suggest a two to three fold excess of schizophrenia in the cohort born in january 1968 whose mothers would have been in the second month of pregnancy in june 1967
6561805 the population of jerusalem would have been most stressed during the three days of bombardment on june 5 7
6561806 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
6561807 our society permits people to sue for libel so that they may vindicate their reputations
6561808 this is an agreement that of course will establish a missile defense site here in poland a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threat to the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6561809 i want to associate myself with what jaap de hoop scheffer said yesterday thats pathetic
6561810 i frankly think that anybody who can do the math would know that 10 interceptors in poland is not going to do anything to a russian deterrent that has thousands of warheads
6561811 john stephens record increased spending at hhs by 438 million
6561812 we thought it was important to set the record straight commissioner john stephens has continually misled voters and his new attack ad is no exception
6561813 if deception and dishonesty were olympic sports this ad would win a gold medal
6561814 the whole ad is complete with inaccurate statements and it says nothing about why the voters should send back the person they threw out of office two years ago
6561815 more spending higher taxes mismanagement and waste thats no change thats just more of the same
6561816 se van a poner complicados los accesos a los puertos y aeropuertos de georgia
6561817 i strongly believe that eddie lewis will be an outstanding addition to the galaxy
6561818 he brings great experience to the club and will be a wonderful addition to our locker room and is a player that the fans are sure to support
6561819 i dont know if this is exactly what jesus meant here
6561820 teachers will conduct ongoing assessment of their pupils progress evaluate their achievement and report results both pupils and parents
6561821 a good slap would not have been out of order pms ing again
6561822 after careful review we are extremely concerned that the ballot language that was adopted for issue 5 has a strong potential to mislead confuse or worse deceive the average ohio voter
6561823 the defendants obviously saw the benefit in olas idea but they apparently didnt think they needed the companys permission to use its patents or to honor their confidentiality agreements
6561824 is likely to go on the dl with a fatigued right arm
6561825 i can assure you we are well aware of the cost for people who have been unfortunately caught up in the fallout
6561826 but the likelihood of this being needed remains extremely low

6561834 i strongly believe that eddie lewis will be an outstanding addition to the galaxy
6561835 he brings great experience to the club and will be a wonderful addition to our locker room and is a player that the fans are sure to support
6561836 reports that actor jean reno is in the hospital due to a heart attack are false he is vacationing in the caribbean and went to a local hospital as a precaution for some discomfort he was feeling due to heartburn and gastroenteritis
6561837 it was definitely not a heart attack he is fine and healthy and enjoying the rest of his vacation travelling in the caribbean
6561838 i think he was just enjoying vacation and probably ate a little too much spicy caribbean food
6561839 let me be f king clear i dont have to have you here thats one thing we can make clear
6561840 i have you here because i feel youre talented but dont get it twisted im starting to think about why i do have you here ill give you an answer soon
6561841 im standing with danity kane arent i im still in the group
6561842 shed need to have a sense of humour to go out with a guy like me
6561843 i would love kids ive just got to find the right lady im an old softie me i send flowers when they need to be sent and stuff like that
6561844 im thoughtful and sweet im not as cold as you think i am
6561845 i knew jeremy briefly i saw him maybe four or five times socially i didnt really know him well
6561846 he blake was a friend and so i read the thing script and liked it
6561847 but id been offered everything from a high fidelity to a john waters film and i just turned it all down
6561848 we never met to discuss the film i did explain to her i wasnt looking to act right then and with the album tour schedule and a baby on the way it wouldnt be feasible
6561849 my father was doing scientology in the 60s so its something that has been around for most of my life
6561850 i was raised celebrating jewish holidays and i consider myself jewish but ive read books on scientology and drawn insights from that
6561851 it was a cigarette case that hitler had given her with a diamond swastika on the top
6561852 i said thats gotta be worth a lot of money and she came out with this revelation when i looked at the history research she had parties where she entertained hitler so she was like a social hostess
6561853 she hated her first husband because he was so domineering i think she was ashamed she hated hitler and didnt really want to talk about the tryst once it was out there
6561854 i think she reluctantly told me because i asked about the cigarette case and immediately regretted it
6561855 she said that she tried to tell movie mogul louis b meyer about hitler and he said he didnt want to talk about hitler and he told her not to talk about hitler i bet she didnt tell anyone except me
6561856 she said she met hitler and was forced into a relationship with him because her husband was making millions of dollars from him
6561857 i just learned to ride recently i guess because i was the youngest of three and my parents were really busy they just assumed that i already knew also we lived on a hill
6561858 its better to be honest than a two faced asshole
6561859 i will pray to the gods of jelly that you will burn in a jelly like hell

6561861 looking at the budget crisis governor schwarzenegger has ordered a temporary reduction of the salaries of 200 000 state employees to the minimum wage this gesture is largely symbolic for it will probably not last very long meanwhile the governor is scheming to borrow 9 3 billion more in the form of a water bond
6561862 some commentators have pointed out this disconnect but schwarzenegger has consistently championed bonds while claiming fiscal discipline he campaigned in 2003 on a platform including large bonds and within a month of election he was campaigning around the state for a 15 billion bond
6561863 hes supported bonds ever since most notably in 2006 when he backed a bipartisan 42 7 billion bond package for transportation and education infrastructure housing programs and flood control
6561864 given the significance of certain functions of government like the jobs these gentlemen do we think its important to be more discerning about these cuts and targeted
6561865 its a 10 million cut if youre already running a deficit youre just digging a deeper hole
6561866 just like families are doing across south carolina the movie budget is not the same as the mortgage budget were not going to cut equally at three percent one has a greater value to the family than the other businesses do it families do it we think government should do it as well
6561867 it would be premature and a waste of time and taxpayer money for the legislature to return to columbia to deal with a budget shortfall at this time a three percent cut in a six billion dollar budget is manageable for any well run state agency priority items such as public education and medicaid have been put at the front of the line in recent years with substantial budget increases so i am not overly concerned about a three percent cut at this time
6561868 if the governor had taken the time to ask before announcing his press fly around he would have found out that i believe that targeted budget cuts are the right thing to do
6561869 opposing the outdated regimes only verbally while the very structures of civil society are vulnerable and ill formed amounts to nothing
6561870 tunisian civil society should change its methods and strategies if it is to contribute to starting and sustaining the democratization process
6561871 arab democrats need to learn to read geopolitical maps and need to stop being na ve and non strategic what we need is a new breed of activists who are at the same time committed and experts
6561872 there is nothing more soul satisfying than the first succulent bite into the juicy frankfurter
6561873 it involves if you must know pressing a duck the treasury gives off a luridly convivial glow like price
6561874 dish your hash nicely and garnish round the edge with brain cakes
6561875 maybe youre struggling just to pay the mortgage on your home
6561876 then again that same day when asked how many houses he owns mccain lost track he couldnt remember
6561877 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6561878 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have
6561879 if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6561880 but if youre like me and you got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home then you might have a different perspective
6561881 and by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes
6561882 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
6561883 were delighted to have a real estate debate with barack obama
6561884 its a frickin mansion he doesnt tell people that you have a mansion you bought in a shady deal with a convicted felon
6561885 you are going to see more of that now that this issue has been joined youll see more of the rezko matter from us
6561886 the reality is they have some investment properties and stuff its not as if he lives in ten houses thats just not the case
6561887 the reality is they have four that actually could be considered houses they could use
6561888 the chinese olympics committee is shitting on the sweat and blood of energetic youth
6561889 a razor shall not touch these whiskers until this thing is up and running and circles the globe a billion times over
6561890 lo look at my fabulously stinky and silly beard pay no attention to the squirming
6561891 we are thrilled to be producing racine for the first time in a c t s history
6561892 timberlakes extraordinary and fresh translation of ph dre pays homage to the gorgeous poetry of the original while sustaining this plays explosive heat and visceral sexuality i have admired stratfords work for many years and am excited to work at the theater where heather kitchen my partner at a c t started her career
6561893 stratford and a c t have an amazing synergy both are actor driven theaters deeply rooted in the classics
6561894 i am amazed at the muscularity of stratfords acting company who perform major classics in repertory for eight months in 2 000 seat houses in particular seana mckenna is a remarkable talent capable of keeping a c t audiences on the edge of their seats through racines erotic and complicated tragedy
6561895 me to i get to go its for my orthodontist
6561896 that depends on how big fannie and freddie blow up
6561897 some hit is going to come from existing preferred shareholders
6561898 theres not protection for shareholders of common or preferred shares
6561899 while some companies will probably have some write downs i dont think theres a widespread effect on the whole industry
6561900 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
6561901 this nation was built on a foundation of free speech the first principle of free speech is protected conscience
6561902 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6561903 planned parenthood continues to be concerned that the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6561904 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6561905 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6561906 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience
6561907 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
6561908 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying the cross
6561909 the scale of the public spending the campaign has proposed to date is too puny to generate a real recovery or to fundamentally alter the trajectory of economic insecurity and inequality
6561910 g u y a n a as an i n d e p e n d e n t nation sitting on the c o n t i n e n t a l shelf of south america and its people was caught up in the rapture of having responded in a very appropriate manner to host carifesta an event that has its inauguration on these very shores further as a government we are pleased with the turnout the government recognises the great importance that the people of guyana showed to the artistic celebrations by dismissing elements within our society who were gleeful enough to promote partisan agendas at the sacrifice of the good of the country it must be noted that the turnout showed an automatic willingness by the majority of guyanese to support this government in its efforts to promote guyana and sends an unambiguous message to those opposed to such a prosperous move notwithstanding the foolhardy doomsayers amongst us guyana can hold its head above the atmospheric elements and be proud to host the biggest cultural even in the region on such a short notice cabinet recognises the effort of president bharrat jagdeo to full fill the mandate of his government and call on guyanese to hearten your leaders to support a constitutional amendment that will see the continuation of governments agenda beyond 2011 government guyana has scored a convincing victory that will go down in the annals of history

6561916 will the plane be held where it is or will it take off
6561917 a manned plane is sitting on a conveyor belt which has the ability to instantaneously match the speed of the plane but in the opposite direction when the plane throttles up will it be held in place or will it take off
6561918 and both are going at the airplanes takeoff speed but in opposite directions
6561919 held in place is in reference to the ground its really just simple english and sentence structure but you apparently dont get it this holds true with every version of the myth that has been presented here
6561920 if a plane isnt allowed to throttle up would it be able to take off
6561921 a manned plane is sitting on a conveyor belt which has the ability to instantaneously match the speed of the plane but in the opposite direction when the plane throttles up will it be held in place or will it take off
6561922 and both are going at the airplanes takeoff speed but in opposite directions
6561923 held in place is in reference to the ground its really just simple english and sentence structure but you apparently dont get it this holds true with every version of the myth that has been presented here

6561943 we have done a thorough investigation and were confident the restaurant is not the source
6561944 our society is run by insane people for insane objectives i think were being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and i think im liable to be put away as insane for expressing that thats whats insane about it
6561945 es ist unzumutbar dass eine organisation die als verfassungsfeindlich eingestuft wird an der gesetzgebung im hessischen parlament beteiligt ist
6561946 wir halten die reaktionen der cdu f r berzogen und hysterisch
6561947 wir werden kl ren ob wir bis zum ende der legislatur einen gemeinsamen weg gehen k nnen
6561948 viele kleine leute und viele kleine orte die viele kleine schritte tun k nnen das gesicht der welt ver ndern
6561949 basically mr polley agreed not to do that any more so we said thats fine
6561950 it works pretty good as long as the wind is blowing
6561951 i think it ended about as well as it could
6561952 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6561953 what id say is that theyre much more aggressive this fighting season than theyve been in the past
6561954 he was respected by his subordinates peers and superiors for his outstanding professionalism operational experience and his competence
6561955 a veteran soldier this was his third tour in afghanistan he was a devoted father who liked to share stories of his children with his colleagues and friends
6561956 he loved his girls and it was very hard for him to go away
6561957 the difference is theyre not holding any of the ground that they attack us on so in the case of an ied strike they will inflict some casualties but they dont control the road they inflicted the casualties on so really the net effect is zero other than it whittles away at our resolve
6561958 our soldiers believe in this mission they know what this is all about
6561959 at the end of the day the taliban are against things theyre not for anything theyre against human rights theyre against education theyre against health care theyre against women theyre just against human decency so if we leave these people if we leave the population of kandahar province in the hands of the taliban we just wont be performing our duty and our soldiers know that
6561960 they were a well trained highly motivated crew and believed in their mission
6561961 are they effective theyre slowing them down will we still see devices in culverts yes
6561962 the only way you can stop an insurgent from doing what an insurgent does is putting a 24 hour watch on the target we cant do that
6561963 because of the irrigation problems and the wet season and all that other stuff theres culverts all over the place for drainage
6561964 what they wanted to do with me is to take my livelihood away and everything else
6561965 i dont think thats constructive to somebody whos struggling to take their passion away from them i feel very strongly about that
6561966 thats what i feel is the biggest lesson to be learned everybody does deserve a second chance or a third chance or whatever if you believe that they can actually come back and do some good
6561967 ive been through a really rough time in my life and i think it made me the person that i am today and made me dive like this
6561968 i could see it screwed up the africans out there i was at home as they were all getting cold i live and train in victoria so im good
6561969 now im going to rest up get some treatment on my knee and get ready for saturday
6561970 this is my first olympic games and i am one of the younger athletes here so i think i have a lot to look forward to

6561972 its tough right now im disappointed i wish i could have it on my own terms
6561973 i lost because of the last point rule but thats how the sport is
6561974 i only turn 16 once so its going to be an awesome party
6561975 the best part of the party is were going to recognize some really cool kids from youth service america who are giving back to their community
6561976 thats so awesome because i think its really important for kids like us to volunteer
6561977 tv is a great thing the way it is we dont want to replace tv we want to augment and add value to the tv experience

6562042 for a minute i thought i was being tapped to be obamas running mate i was a little bit confused as to the purpose of the call since all the veepee hopefuls are staying real close to the phone this week until obama makes his choice public one announcer characterized the hopefuls as nervous school girls waiting for a prom date you can imagine how confused i was to get a call from obama
6562043 turns out it was a canvass caller looking for my support for him not the veepee spot after all it appears my stealth bomber campaign for the white house is so low key not even some obama people know i am running against him for the democratic nomination i guess i better step it up a notch

6562092 ik dacht voor de start dit is eigenlijk wel gaaf met de beste zeilers te wereld en het grootste sportevenement ter wereld een wedstrijd varen we moesten vandaag winnen om de argentijnen te verslaan en dat is niet gelukt daar baal ik van we hadden niet zon heel goede start maar daarna wel een prima gang het was alleen een mijnenveld daarbuiten hoge golven en veel stroom de britten waren beter weg en gingen direct aan de leiding
6562093 derde worden in deze race is mooi maar niet goed genoeg
6562094 ik kan nu niet blij zijn met de vijfde plek mitch en ik hebben twee jaar geleden tegen elkaar gezegd dat we een plak gingen winnen en dat is niet gelukt dat is een rotgevoel
6562095 ik had graag verder gegaan in de tornado ik denk dat deze klasse vandaag heeft laten zien wel degelijk mediageniek te zijn we hebben een mooie show weggeven het is echt jammer dat we geen kans meer krijgen maar ik ben nog niet klaar
6562096 dat is het spel je moet een constante reeks neerzetten dat hebben de spanjaarden hier gedaan dus zij verdienen het om te winnen
6562097 ik ben blij dat we vandaag hebben kunnen laten zien wat deze boten te bieden hebben de golven waren net wat te hoog om tot maximale snelheid te pushen
6562098 dit waren mijn vierde spelen en ik heb nog nooit zoveel wind gehad als we dezelfde condities als de 470 hadden gehad was het een heel ander verhaal geweest wij zijn dus blij met onze beslissing om dat zeil uiteindelijk niet te gebruiken

6562103 some of these so called hip hop kids hate on me because im not ashamed to be white the funny thing is that i get along better with the hood dudes than those kids its easier for people who are different and who are being themselves to get along on any rap scene if i was trying to be hood then i would just look like a clown

6562105 gnotes mixes different styles delivers masterpiece with rhymes and beats gnotes blends lush production and thoughtful lyrics to form some of the best hip hop in the world
6562106 rhymes and beats is a series of songs that exposes the diligent work of a man that raps like hes been waiting for this album his whole life few are shining brighter than gnotes right now
6562107 musically it is innovative and pleasing with care and effort put into virtually every bar in every verse in each and every song you can tell that gnotes burns with a passion to be the best that he can be

6562110 the strong guitar riffs and enjoyable trumpets on samba tryst make the track stand out as one of my favorites
6562111 its not quite like any other hip hop record ive heard before the instrumentals are more vibrant and alive than a lot of albums these days there are clearly a wide range of musical influences at play here and it makes for a unique sound
6562112 his flow is controlled but with a certain appealing looseness his lyrics are informed bordering on the didactic and his beats are well constructed and melodic easy to follow without being boring proving that hes able to keep up with any of the bigger indie names out there
6562113 not only did gnotes dazzle the crowd with his lyrical prowess but he showed his diverse musical talents rocking the guitar with elemental zazen all in all gnotes proved himself to be a multi talented multi faceted musician worth leaving your house on a crappy ass rainy night
6562114 is the utmost of compliments to stand out amongst the rest

6562164 why we are so good at recognizing and remembering faces
6562165 a brief glance at a face conveys a wealth of information about identity expression gender age mood intent attractiveness social states and even honesty
6562166 the ability to extract this information within a fraction of a second of viewing a face is important for normal social interaction and has probably played a critical role in the survival of our primate ancestors

6562175 activists citizens politicians thinkers came together during the first gilded age and really created a spirit of reform created a sense of experimentation aimed at trying to create a more fair society
6562176 we need to empower people in cities and states to solve problems
6562177 but that focus on the common good and on providing opportunity for everyone has been lost in my view in the last seven years and we need to return to it
6562178 i think that requiring people to come out of the gray and out of the shadows of our economy and register or face deportation and putting some real muscle behind that is a way of bridging the gap between more conservative and more liberal elements in our democratic politics
6562179 im trying to give him some advice on that but that advice will remain private
6562180 come blessed of my father into the kingdom prepared for you from the founding of the world for i was hungry and you fed me i was thirsty and you gave me water i was a stranger and you invited me into your homes naked and you clothed me sick and you visited me i was in prison and you came to me as long as you did it for one of these the least of my brethren you did it for me
6562181 i used to go over to have lunch with doris and jim and i would sit across from jim at the kitchen table and think before me is a true american hero
6562182 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments
6562183 they said a wife of one of the ss officers they called her the bitch of buchenwald saw a tattoo she liked on the arm of a prisoner and had the skin made into a lampshade i saw that
6562184 its important that we dont allow ourselves to lose him
6562185 its the memory of heroes like james hoyt and the memories of what theyve done that we must ensure that we keep alive and share with the current generation and future generations
6562186 you think back on a young man 19 years old and to have the experience that he had
6562187 a symbol of the chill blooded cruelty of the german nazi state
6562188 there is reason to believe that the prompt arrival of the 6th armored division on the scene saved many hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives
6562189 at the same time a group of russians just escaped from the concentration camp burst out of the woods attempting to attack the ss men the russians were restrained and interrogated
6562190 as guides to investigate report and rejoin as rapidly as possible
6562191 i took this side journey of about 3 km away from our main force because we kept encountering ss guards and prison inmates and the latter told us of the large camp to the south
6562192 we had been told by our intelligence that we might overrun a large prison camp but we or at least i had no idea of either the gigantic size of the camp or of the full extent of the incredible brutality
6562193 we were tumultuously greeted by what i was told were 21 000 men and what an incredible greeting that was
6562194 i was picked up by arms and legs thrown into the air caught thrown again caught thrown etc
6562195 how the men found such a surge of strength in their emaciated condition was one of those bodily wonders in which the spirit sometimes overcomes all weaknesses of the flesh my but it was a great day
6562196 the worst concentration camp yet to be uncovered by west wall troops
6562197 seeing these things it changes you i was a kid
6562198 des moines had been the furthest id ever been from home i still have horrific dreams usually someone needs help and i cant help them im in a situation where im trapped and i cant get out
6562199 thinking back i would have pushed to be a psychologist if for no other reason than to understand myself better
6562200 memories of evil get erased for life must go on and new generations cannot be locked in the past but they would do well to remember the past
6562201 when the prisoners saw jim they picked him up and threw him in the air thats how happy they were after seeing such horrors prisoners had been hung from hooks to die he saw a lampshade made from a prisoners tattoo jim carried those horrors with him forever he never got what he had seen out of his mind if you ever wondered about jim think about what he saw
6562202 when you were discharged no one really gave a hoot about you it was difficult for a compassionate person like jim to forget what he saw he was a hero
6562203 the connection between models and food was not an obvious one

6562217 shes not the type of person to say hey i dont feel good
6562218 all i hear from her is i hate having this i dont want to take my shot
6562219 as far as how long she can go it depends on the severity
6562220 i have seen people who go dangerously bad right away were talking about days maybe weeks
6562221 she may not make the right decisions and so forth
6562222 when i got my phd in physics this was in 73 there were 20 000 phd physicists on the records of the american physical society
6562223 out of that 20 000 only 79 were african american and even a smaller number were theoretical physicists so i was one of the very first and few
6562224 he loved science and math and the earliest toys he gave me were a gyroscope and crystal radio set
6562225 and he spent a lot of time with me in order to get my allowance he would ask me something from the multiplication table if i didnt answer right away i wouldnt get allowance i felt that he was grooming me to take part in what he was going to be doing
6562226 when he died my entire world just came apart for me
6562227 i was very very deeply connected to him and it just left a vacuum there
6562228 it was a classic illustrated and it turned things around for me
6562229 i thought if i build a time machine then i would be able to see him his father again and tell him what was going to happen to warn him
6562230 and when i flipped through it i actually realized that this man einstein said that time was something that wasnt fixed that you could actually change time i knew that if i could understand einstein i could actually make the dream of a time machine real
6562231 if i dont have the courage to be open and let people know what i passed through how will they be motivated to follow their own dreams

6562235 when we got married he had to get his parents consent but i didnt it made me feel like an old lady
6562236 i had to get home after the wedding to go fill silo
6562237 we didnt know enough about other things at that time we just knew about the way we lived lucille had been teaching school and i was farming so we were both working at that time if you were a married lady you couldnt teach school anymore
6562238 and i didnt want to wait another year to get married i didnt want to teach anymore
6562239 the farm was a good place to make a living at the time i never did anything else so you never got tired of it
6562240 i did drive a milk truck to anoka for awhile
6562241 i just know we had a lot of happy times together
6562242 i guess grandpa had a heck of a time trying to cut that pancake grandma got a big laugh out of it
6562243 i told lucille to hit it after the car got moving well she didnt stop driving until we got home i rode on the bumper all the way but at least we made it home sometimes you just got to put up with things like that

6562250 theres already a seed or root set at a much earlier point and people may not be aware of these seeds
6562251 are indeed consciously accessible in the sense that they produce some kind of positive or negative gut reaction
6562252 people can feel those gut reactions but what people arent aware of is how these automatic associations influence their perceptions of reality that is where the unconscious part comes in

6562256 should you keep the car or trade it in for a brand new vehicle
6562257 people who keep their cars treat them as valuable investments and commit to regular vehicle maintenance end up saving a lot of money
6562258 we advise our clients that if they want to see an increase on their investments every year they need to cut down on their expenses
6562259 a new automobile is for most people their second biggest investment next to a home so a great way to save money and increase financial assets is to hang on to their current vehicle rather than buy a new one every few years

6562309 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
6562310 the fact that john mccain dispatched his paid consultant to launch this despicable ad from a so called independent committee shows how desperate he is to change the subject from his shocking disconnect with the economic struggles of the american people
6562311 he knows that barack obama has denounced the detestable crimes that bill ayers committed forty years ago instead of invoking paris britney and obscure sixties radicals senator mccain should take the day off at one of his seven homes to consider whether his support for outsourcing tax breaks for companies who ship jobs overseas and continued spending of ten billion a month in iraq is really putting country first to us it sounds like just more of the same
6562312 chris im sure youve got people who you serve on a board with or have dinner with who you know you would never expect to somehow have that seen as an endorsement of their views now you know mr ayers is a 60 plus year old individual who lives in my neighborhood who did something that i deplore 40 years ago when i was 6 or 7 years old by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education he worked for mayor daley the same mayor daley by the way who when he was a states attorney prosecuted mr ayers wife for those activities in the 60s so the point is that to somehow suggest that in any way i endorse his deplorable acts 40 years ago because i serve on a board with him
6562313 as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago
6562314 and the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was eight years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense obama has said
6562315 strongly condemns the violent actions of the weathermen but he was an 8 year old child
6562316 there is no evidence whatsoever that obama harbours even a smidgen of sympathy for ayers radicalism or the weather undergrounds worldview
6562317 there is of course no evidence whatsoever that obama harbours even a smidgen of sympathy for ayers radicalism or the weather undergrounds worldview and more generally if the views of every person with whom a presidential candidate has ever interacted are to be judged as possible disqualifiers from office americas political future would look very impoverished indeed
6562318 those have been the options in the debate but the truth is a third option ayers and dohrn are despicable and yet making an issue of obamas relationship with them is absurd
6562319 but the obama ayers link is a tenuous one as newsday pointed out clinton has her own also tenuous weatherman connection her husband commuted the sentences of a couple of convicted weather underground members susan rosenberg and linda sue evans shortly before leaving office in january 2001 which is worse pardoning a convicted terrorist or accepting a campaign contribution from a former weatherman who was never convicted
6562320 but ayers it is also true to say has since followed in the footsteps of the great chicago social worker jane addams crusading for education and juvenile justice reform his 1997 book a kind and just parent the children of juvenile court has been praised for exposing how cook countys juvenile justice system all but eliminates a childs chance for redemption is barack obama consorting with a radical hardly ayers is nothing more than an aging lefty with a foolish past who is doing good and while yes obama is friendly with ayers it appears to be only in the way of two community activists whose circles overlap obamas middle name is hussein that doesnt make him an islamic terrorist he stopped wearing a flag pin that doesnt make him unpatriotic and hes friendly with uic professor william ayers that doesnt make him a bomb thrower time to move on to phony flap 6 537 204
6562321 ben says ayers and obama were at best casual friends even that seems to overstate things though i dont see evidence of any relationship the only concrete connection we know of is the meeting which was attended by a number of local liberals their contemporaneous membership on the board of a local organization and a 200 donation by ayers to one of obamas state senate campaigns obama also once praised something ayers had written about the juvenile justice system im not saying they couldnt have been casual friends just that there isnt much evidence for that at this point

6562333 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6562334 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6562335 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6562336 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6562337 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6562338 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6562339 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6562340 i cant imagine a world without genes larger than life presence
6562341 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6562342 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6562343 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6562344 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6562345 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union
6562346 he was the equal of owners in negotiations and made the league a better place for all players playing alongside of gene was an honor and a privilege he was a pillar of strength and leadership for our great raider teams

6562349 how can i best extrapolate a hurter driffield curve in my experiments on photographic material transmission densities
6562350 from age 2 or 3 to 5 imaginationschildren have such vivid imaginations but then they go to school and are made to feel that they should think and act like everyone else and they seem to lose their individual imaginations and draw what is expected of them
6562351 recently in our science class we were asked to draw a picture of a scientist
6562352 when we handed it in our teacher got what she expected mostly all of us had drawn men with white lab coats and tubes with liquids in them
6562353 if you asked us to draw popular kids wed draw them with makeup and nice clothes and big houses if you asked us to draw farmers wed draw men with overalls baseball caps and straw in their mouths
6562354 although there are still stereotypical responses given when children are asked to draw a scientist if you interview them they will qualify their work by saying they had to draw it that way so that you know what it is
6562355 there seems to be very little in the national curriculum on the nature of science who does it and why
6562356 a discussion around these areas might make children think more widely about who is a scientist and what scientists actually do
6562357 i do not see a problem with children drawing pictures of scientists as men in white coats we do need to know what childrens perceptions themwe do need to know what childrens perceptions are before we can change them
6562358 moreover everyone likes to build myths and interesting characteristics around scientific personalities to set them aside as somehow different from the rest of us
6562359 it is important to challenge children in their thinking and the adults who work with them
6562360 what image do children have of other rare breeds such as say theologians or historians
6562361 and insofar as children do think about scientists their image is probably colored much more by the biosciences than previously
6562362 the students seemed genuinely interested in what was being said any well presented information seems to strike their imagination and make them interested in the subject
6562363 i do think that children are intimidated by science perhaps not the younger ones but as they get older
6562364 most children seem to think of a doctor as someone who studies science and he is in white garb
6562365 children think of scientists as smart albeit a bit weird as shown by the hair and dedicated to the profession if anything should be done it is to have more interaction between the scientific community and the public
6562366 it may be one of the things that turns a young childs eyes toward science in the first place
6562367 in a video show at school for instance would kids watch a normal scientist for even 15 minutes
6562368 with everything else a kid could watch these days thats a small miracle

6562394 they have not yet returned to the torah of eretz israel
6562395 historically nusach eretz israel was used outside of israel and given that the return to israel has made it the largest jewish community in the world its entirely right that it should be used everywhere
6562396 we are working closely with the israeli authorities and our partners in the child welfare authorities to make this a top priority

6562481 i probably went over the race a million times in my head merritt said
6562482 i used to run that way back in high school before i started to get all technical so i came here and said im just going to open up and let it fly and thats how it played out
6562483 people said i was the underdog because of experience merritt said
6562484 but i believed i could do it and that is the first step in winning
6562485 i have been looking for this moment for four years merritt said
6562486 to run 44 flat early in the season made me know i was ready to run fast merritt said
6562487 i knew everyone would bring their a game merritt said

6562497 the dollar has been undermined by renewed concerns over the health of the us financial system
6562498 the recent decline in gas gasoline prices isnt enough to overcome all the negative momentum thats been building up through the spring and summer
6562499 a few months ago there was some discussion about a second half 2008 economic recovery if theres a second half recovery itll be the second half of 2009
6562500 we might see some further scaling back of already diminished expectations for the federal reserve to raise us interest rates over the next six months
6562501 the question is whether this is a retracement of the retracement or a reversal of the dollars weakness
6562502 my feeling is that the dollar will definitely give back some of its gains but will not be subject to the aggressive selling of the last year in short traders simply get tired of trading on the same news despite its significance
6562503 is there any reason why x decided not to contribute towards httpush whisker rfproxy elza stake webproxy or another established tool that already does this

6562527 these are the same people mr flaherty mr baird mr clement who are responsible for what happened in walkerton who privatized ontarios propane inspection and they want to do something equivalent about food inspections which is at the core of what the government should do

6562545 helping build a community of entrepreneurs by giving them the tools support and solutions they require in order to build successful companies is extremely important for building sustainable communities
6562546 on the african continent there are more versions of business centers than there are countries for example angola has at least two one is a library of relevant training and reference materials backed by a staff of counselors to accommodate walk in clients and another restricts itself to industries related to oil production and export in order to help build a specific economic sector
6562547 in egypt four deal with microbusiness and another two with larger ventures
6562548 write a business plan that addresses the usual issues of marketing competition finance and governance
6562549 the rules governing for and nonprofit or nongovernmental sector legal and organizational issues vary significantly from country to country as do the methods for setting them up and the time needed to do so many countries do not have clear legal definitions of nonprofit or nongovernmental entities or require excessive time and effort to create them
6562550 at the moment there is a favorable climate for entrepreneurship but even those with good ideas dont have access to capital
6562551 convene a meeting of business groups and have a clear conversation about your vision and dream then ask them how they can be part of this center which would be breaking new ground

6562564 the seemingly softer tone to the committees discussion in keeping with a more muted outlook in the inflation report does seem to have pretty much ruled out any prospect of a rate hike which was already slim as it would risk an unnecessarily deep downturn
6562565 although we envisage the first rate cut next year there is every chance that the mpc begins to cut as early as november especially if commodity prices continue to fall and economic activity falters as expected
6562566 concerns about demand were a more important factor in restraining investment than restrictions in the supply of credit although credit was becoming harder to obtain

6562859 i urged him to move ahead in the israel syria negotiations as much as possible so that whoever is the next president would not start from too far down the track
6562860 i did not say anything about obama or mccain i said whoever is the next president is not going to want to inherit a process that isnt going anywhere
6562861 senator obama values the expertise of ambassador kurtzer but he is not a paid adviser nor is he authorized to conduct talks with any government ambassador kurtzers trip was part of an american bar association aba delegation on legal reform and had no connection with the campaign

6562868 the gentlemen at the airport said to butch when we transferred him to my carrier
6562869 we did not have much time together but it was filled with love
6562870 the pine tree lives for a thousand years the morning glory but for a single day yet each have fulfilled their destiny
6562871 and as a cat you know i am most able to decide anything for myself
6562872 but i must come slowly for my human friend is troubled for you see he needs me quite certainly
6562873 that youll never leave him that your souls are intertwined for all eternity that nothing is created or destroyed it just is forever and ever and ever

6562876 it will take some more time for operations to stabilise we are committed to providing world class infrastructure in a time bound manner by the end of this year domestic terminal 1 d will be ready while the new terminal 3 will come up by early 2010 as of now flight movement at delhi airport is 35 40 per hour and it will go up to 60 with the coming into being of the third runway
6562877 runways are roads that lead to the sky and it is our commitment to build infrastructure that paves the way for indias economy to reach new heights
6562878 this is our country and we have to save it lets debate this for however long we want but the house should find a solution and tell the government how to deal with the situation
6562879 we cannot allow terrorists to challenge the writ of the government how is it fair that terrorists can give the government one week time to resign and threaten to start bombing if they dont get their way we have to secure the lives and property of our people if we do not stop them now tomorrow they may attack this very house they may cause a terrorist incident inside the house they may take the members hostage
6562880 the war on terror cannot be won on defensive we have to take the battle to the doorsteps of the extremists
6562881 we are not being attacked by any outside military or a known army our enemy lurks silently within our society this is our own war
6562882 we are offering an attractive bolt on data plan offering free 500 mb a month for the first 12 months for all iphone users besides giving m check e commerce service and access to our portal airtel live
6562883 the numbers would be out only after two weeks but i can say the response has been very encouraging
6562884 we are offering various data and other packages with the iphone therefore the prices are high an iphone without bundling would cost the same as in other developed markets
6562885 the german chair is trying sincerely to do this by tomorrow friday
6562886 but to me it seems as if another round of discussions will be needed at a later date
6562887 what will happen now is that the u s will mull over these ideas and come back to the nsg tomorrow afternoon
6562888 and i presume they will spend tonight and tomorrow discussing how these ideas and suggestions could be incorporated if at all in the proposed waiver
6562889 for example if the other major nuclear countries which have to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty in order for it to enter into force do so then is it right that india should remain outside
6562890 so can we think of some way to say india will not stand in the way of the treaty entering into force
6562891 look i think you india will be happy with the outcome
6562892 i think there is full awareness within the nsg of what are the indian red lines and no one has any intention of crossing them
6562893 is a serious subject and its a room full of serious people who have taken it in that manner
6562894 but for our part in the united states we continue to believe this is a very important initiative and we remain committed to achieving an outcome that is both a net benefit for the non proliferation regime and it meets indias energy needs
6562895 an important emerging relationship with india that we continue to believe is critical and important for the united states
6562896 there is nothing new that is being said every countrys position is well known but the question is whether we can take a decision either way by tomorrow
6562897 what some countries are looking for is tighter language tying the nsgs waiver to those commitments
6562898 they are senior advocates and did not tender either conditional or unconditional apology for their conduct in the bmw case
6562899 they have forfeited their right to enjoy the honour conferred on them by this court of being designated as senior advocates
6562900 given the facts of this case we are of the view that this is not one of those rare and brazen cases where we should initiate suo motu action against ndtv for contempt of court
6562901 he anand has been an mp of the rajya sabha that he should indulge in such practice may have taken many in legal fraternity by surprise
6562902 usurping the powers of the bar council of delhi in imposing a ban on the two senior lawyers for four months from practising in the high court and all other subordinate courts and tribunals coming under the supervisory powers of the high court
6562903 that to me is the most striking part about it transmitting 60 watts at 75 percent efficiency over several feet

6562913 one of the key reasons for the success of the chevrolet cobalt and pontiac g5 is the lordstown workforce and the strong partnerships with the uaw and local and state officials
6562914 based on the quality of work and these strong partnerships we are pleased to announce our plans to invest another 500 million in the chevy cruze product program in the u s including more than 350 million in lordstown
6562915 the cruze will build on the already successful chevrolet cobalt cobalt xfe and cobalt ss all of which are nearly sold out in dealer showrooms
6562916 our dealers are asking for many more cobalts than we can build
6562917 the chevrolet cruze was designed and engineered by our global teams in europe and asia pacific and will be manufactured in those regions in addition to the assembly plant here in lordstown ohio
6562918 our goal for the chevrolet cruze is to lead in fuel economy in this very competitive car segment

6562922 this is the beginning of a number of distribution announcements that will go beyond content producers to oems
6562923 when it comes to founders we know we are usually going to see something odd
6562924 in some cases they are exorbitantly paid and in others they are paid miserly
6562925 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6562926 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce
6562927 its one big step forward in improving the safety of fresh produce

6562935 the rockets are not aimed at russia but instead provide cover for our allies who in turn defend us in times of need

6562944 we know that war service can have both a physical and mental impact on the lives of service personnel physical impairment can be obvious psychological injury is less so
6562945 this government is determined to support veterans and ex service personnel who may suffer psychologically as a result of their service however to do so we need a better understanding of the incidence and characteristics of suicide amongst this community
6562946 we are seeking to better identify those at risk common contributing factors in recent cases the incidence of suicide in the ex service community and whether there is more that government agencies and the medical and allied health professions can do to support veterans under stress
6562947 we know that war service can have both a physical and mental impact on the lives of service personnel physical impairment can be obvious psychological injury is less so

6562953 these soldiers made an important contribution to international efforts in afghanistan aimed at creating the conditions necessary for reconstruction and development efforts to flourish in a country ravaged by decades of war and despotism
6562954 they were on their way to the site where they were going to do a reconnaissance of a route

6562956 i dont know that the taliban are getting any stronger
6562957 what i would say is that theyre much more aggressive this fighting season than theyve been in the past
6562958 not holding any of the ground theyre attacking us on
6562959 so in the case of an ied strike they will inflict some casualties but they dont control the road that they inflicted the casualties on so the net effect is zero other than it whittles away at our resolve
6562960 if senator obama is truly going to bring transparency to washington this is surely no way to do it
6562961 and maybe this is a playing out of his negotiating with dictators and people like that without preconditions
6562962 to move ahead in the israel syria negotiations as much as possible so that whoever is the next president would not start from too far down the track i did not say anything about obama or mccain i said whoever is the next president is not going to want to inherit a process that isnt going anywhere

6562966 some press accounts have contained statements faulting the fbi for dr bruce ivins suicide we disavow such speculation
6562967 he was a devoted father who liked to share stories with his children colleagues and friends
6562968 an engineer reconnaissance team is a tight knit unit and these men were no exception they were a well trained highly motivated crew and believed in their mission as combat engineers they were proud resourceful and armed with technical knowledge they generously used in this mission to help the people of kandahar
6562969 these terrorist attacks will not change our resolution to help the people of afghanistan we are a great people and well face their awful attacks against our soldiers with courage and determination

6563053 we must begin by really standing with the iraqi people and defending their right to resist i can remain myself against all forms of violence and yet i cannot judge what someone has to do when pushed to the wall to protect all they love the iraqi people are fighting for their country to protect their families and to preserve all they love they are fighting for their lives and we are fighting for lies

6563055 barack obama has said he knows he needs to earn the trust of the military when he speaks before the veterans of foreign wars today he could take a giant step toward earning that trust by renouncing jodie evans and her bundled campaign dollars and denounce her support of the iraq insurgency
6563056 since the cold war ended the united states has been pushing the buttons of russian frustration and paranoia by moving ever further into moscows former sphere of influence and we have rarely stopped to consider whether we were overreaching even as evidence mounted that the patience of a wealthier and more assertive russia was wearing very thin
6563057 georgia another breadbasket and location of a critical pipeline is the birthplace of stalin whos enjoying a new revisionist popularity in russia putin warned repeatedly that he would never permit nato in the caucasus but we kept shrugging this off as more bluff and bluster once youve driven a bear into a cave it may be wise to stop poking him with a stick we seemed to delight in it
6563058 the bush administration has only stepped up this policy it is one of the few areas where there has been real continuity between clinton and bush with its unwavering effort to set up missile defense sites in poland and the czech republic
6563059 they may be talking of georgian atrocities but we in the west have not heard them nor will we given the bias of our media which is in thrall to the georgia lobby and its u

6563061 we will host a russian missile system in our country to counter the us
6563062 my vp wont be like that other vice president who thinks he is above the law
6563063 weapons of mass destruction are less dangerous without a means for launching them but once a launching system is developed the situation will be terrible
6563064 it is a mutual interest of russia of israel and of the pragmatic leaders and states in the region not to send long range missiles to syria
6563065 my vp wont be like that other vice president who thinks he is above the law
6563066 we will host a russian missile system in our country to counter the us

6563124 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6563125 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6563126 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6563127 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6563128 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

6563130 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6563131 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6563132 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6563133 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6563134 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

6563139 es sah von vornherein nicht nach einer liebesheirat mit schaeffler aus
6563140 ein gro er investor aus deutschland ist einem lieber als etwa aus korea china oder russland
6563141 er scheint sehr angetan von schaeffler es sieht zu sehr danach aus als z ge er mit wennemer nicht an einem strang
6563142 das ergebnis kann sich sehen lassen schaeffler musste einige garantien geben
6563143 vor allem ist die subkomponente der bezahlten preise deutlich zur ckgekommen und die besch ftigung daf r kr ftig angezogen
6563144 no its not that was the first time this is just you not getting the picture
6563145 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6563146 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6563147 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6563148 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6563149 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6563150 im a monkey a crazy monkey stuck inside its cage
6563151 it is not a replacement for the internet or any other communications technology rather the purpose of geni to test and mature a wide range of research ideas in data communications and distributed systems
6563152 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6563153 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6563154 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6563155 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6563156 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6563157 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6563158 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6563159 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6563160 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6563161 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6563162 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6563163 honey its not just the tags the tags are just a minuscule part of this world wide web
6563164 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6563165 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6563166 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6563167 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6563168 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6563169 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6563170 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6563171 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6563172 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6563173 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6563174 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6563175 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6563176 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6563177 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6563178 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6563179 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6563180 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6563181 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6563182 who are open to doing something on the production side
6563183 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6563184 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6563185 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6563186 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6563187 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6563188 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6563189 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6563190 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6563191 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6563192 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6563193 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6563194 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6563195 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6563196 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6563197 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6563198 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6563199 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6563200 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6563201 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6563202 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6563203 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6563204 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6563205 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6563206 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6563207 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6563208 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6563209 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6563210 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6563211 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6563212 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6563213 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6563214 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6563215 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6563216 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6563217 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6563218 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

6563224 la auditoria administrativa como campo especifico de alguien sabe quienes fueron los autores principales de las ciencias conductuales o en donde lo encuentro en espa ol
6563225 but in 1978 even in copenhagen one didnt see these muslim immigrants the danish population embraced visitors celebrated the exotic went out of its way to protect each of its citizens
6563226 muslim immigrants constitute 5 percent of the population but consume upwards of 40 percent of the welfare spending
6563227 muslims are only 4 percent of denmarks 5 4 million people but make up a majority of the countrys convicted rapists an especially combustible issue given that practically all the female victims are non muslim similar if lesser disproportions are found in other crimes
6563228 over time as muslim immigrants increase in numbers they wish less to mix with the indigenous population a recent survey finds that only 5 percent of young muslim immigrants would readily marry a dane
6563229 muslim leaders openly declare their goal of introducing islamic law once denmarks muslim population grows large enough a not that remote prospect if present trends persist one sociologist estimates every third inhabitant of denmark in 40 years will be muslim
6563230 and i like practicing law in house not just because of lifestyle issues but it gets you closer to the business people i really like that
6563231 dont sit in your office like a lawyer waiting for the phone to ring it will ring but if you need to talk to someone go to their office and talk to them ask a lot of questions
6563232 the placement office is an area where students experience a certain level of disappointment because they dont always get the job they want
6563233 whats happened here fostered by my predecessors is our faculty members really care about the teaching and are accessible
6563234 youll find the career services reputation has a lot to do with some students having higher aspirations than their grades warrant
6563235 its hard to get a job at vinson amp elkins if you are at the bottom of the class
6563236 the fact that our students recognize our faculty are both talented in the ability to prepare them and care about preparing them making themselves available not just as teachers but as mentors is something that i think this current group of professors feels very strongly about
6563237 there is this perception that unless you are in the top quarter of the class the career services office is not really there for you
6563238 i know for a fact that that is not true in the case of our group our career services staff works very hard to assist students wherever they are in the spectrum of accomplishments to get a job
6563239 we dont have the money for an absolute state of the art system
6563240 we certainly have student satisfaction as a high priority at the school
6563241 im sure well be looking at the results of our survey to figure out what to do to make our students more satisfied with their experience here
6563242 we aim in our program to get students ready for practice and their belief that we have fulfilled this mission is extremely gratifying for us
6563243 i fully agree that we need to be more diverse with regard to our faculty and our students
6563244 we hired two persons of color onto the faculty this spring
6563245 most of the faculty have an open door policy and a flexible schedule policy
6563246 we knew that the students perceived this as a problem and the school is addressing it
6563247 ive been in this shop man and boy for five and twenty years ive seen things you people wouldnt believe attack ships on fire off the shoulder of orion i watched c beams glitter in the dark near the tannhauser gate all those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain time to die
6563248 hang on are you channelling rutger hauers character from blade runner
6563249 in terms of financially running the ship murphy is doing a good job given a very troubled retail franchise and the economic climate
6563250 it needs to refocus both the core gap nameplate and in particular old navy
6563251 the industry has taken much greater strides than anyone ever imagined 40 years ago
6563252 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
6563253 i pleaded for more territory more ministry and influence for him and stepped forward to receive it

6563320 yes power is more diversified its no longer just in the hands of a few party brokers
6563321 not yet but they will in the future all issues are basically decided before the delegates get there technology is now able to permit the delegates to transact any business that needs to be done without the expense of a convention the event is a pr plus for the candidates so until that can be replaced it will stay
6563322 bad the conventions ought to be an opportunity for citizens to interact with other citizens from around the country to discuss politics
6563323 good let the campaigns talk to the voters in the increasingly targeted deliberate and innovative ways they do best prime time speeches to the faithful in the arena round and to the few and far between who may be watching is so 1960s be done with it already
6563324 no for several reasons 1 the states guard their moment in the spotlight too jealously 2 there are too many state and local officials involved in running elections who would lose jobs to national coordinators if that occurred more likely we will see regional primaries e g south northeast etc organized on a state by state basis but held on the same day this would reduce the number of primaries eliminate the ridiculously long and expensive campaigns we run now and allow the candidates to consolidate their forces where they are strongest
6563325 no the inter state differences are as profound as the intra state differences the parties raise money provide educational forums on how best to run for office gather and store essential information for micro targeting and supply warm bodies to help organize all useful functions as someone smarter than i once said the two u s national parties are like two bottles with the same label and both empty only the idealogues have been fooled by thinking either party has a role to play in advancing their ideas
6563326 yes the status quo the country is 10 trillion in debt hard to put funding elections ahead of other national priorities
6563327 no only through a level playing field will candidates of sincere leadership abilities be willing to step forward currently those who are most qualified to lead opt out of the system since effective leadership requires balance and our presidential election process is the furthest thing from it
6563328 yes continuing to raise money through private sources better disclosure and fewer abstruse restrictions would vastly improve the system
6563329 maybe i dont believe that the american public can be sold on public financing at this point in time the alternative is sunshine lots and lots of sunshine political contributions of any amount must be a matter of public record in a timely complete and accessible manner this must include contributions to any independent group that seeks to affect the outcome of an election a phrase that must be very specifically and carefully defined it seems to me that with the right to free speech comes the responsibility to claim ones voice anonymous infusions of cash into election messages do not meet that standard technological advances make speed accuracy and accessibility attainable goals however lack of political will continues to be the stumbling block to achieving this level of accountability
6563330 yes the obama model republicans will master it by 2012

6563356 terrified of allowing western countries to build any kind of cushion for the unexpected because it has the potential to return prices to normal or sustainable economic levels

6563452 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing if drinking continues to increase to levels of problem use their ability and or opportunity to have children may be impaired
6563453 this would help clarify how much of the connection between alcohol dependence and delayed reproduction is due to adverse effects of alcohol on reproductive functioning and how much is due to reproductive problems creating pain and distress that may be self medicated by alcohol

6563466 a few people who were transported in ambulances were double counted
6563467 it sounds pretty cliche almost like the beginning of a bad joke
6563468 you first have to accept that having cravings is normal but you dont have to give in to every one
6563469 the people in our research who manage their weight the best are not those who crave foods less often but those who give in some of the time
6563470 and premenstrual womens cravings are more likely to be insistent
6563471 if you havent eaten for hours and youre really hungry that is a physical craving and you should eat
6563472 in one of our studies we rigged games so that people would either succeed or lose and we found that they ended up having a stronger craving when they won

6563574 one of the most revealing insights from recent research is how little excitement some people feel about their daily encounter with us

6563595 in light of recent developments connected to carbon sequestration that make further present efforts in this arena too speculative
6563596 their product was emissions reductions so if they didnt get past the proof of concept then they couldnt monetize what they were going to do and there wasnt in that structure a way for them to make money
6563597 do the organisms rapidly expire and quickly sink outside of the carbon cycle or are they metabolized again and end up in the atmosphere
6563598 i dont know that thats ever been conclusively proven and the european union treated it effectively as pollution
6563599 venture investors might be more helpful they might find people who are more patient and who take a longer view on things than public shareholders and the investors might be able to have a great deal more oversight on what the company is doing prior to commercialization

6563608 the dollar has been undermined by renewed concerns over the health of the us financial system
6563609 the recent decline in gas gasoline prices isnt enough to overcome all the negative momentum thats been building up through the spring and summer
6563610 a few months ago there was some discussion about a second half 2008 economic recovery if theres a second half recovery itll be the second half of 2009
6563611 we might see some further scaling back of already diminished expectations for the federal reserve to raise us interest rates over the next six months
6563612 the question is whether this is a retracement of the retracement or a reversal of the dollars weakness
6563613 my feeling is that the dollar will definitely give back some of its gains but will not be subject to the aggressive selling of the last year in short traders simply get tired of trading on the same news despite its significance
6563614 given the significant rally in the u s dollar that has taken place over the last two and a half weeks i think the market has gotten a little bit over extended here and weve entered into a bit of a corrective phase
6563615 for the most part the main catalyst still comes back to price action in the commodity markets and with a substantial spike higher in oil today were seeing not only the u s dollar weaken off against the major currencies but thats been a benefit for the canadian dollar given the positive correlation between crude and the loonie
6563616 i think oil prices are finding some sort of base
6563617 and we do have some issues going on now the u s dollar declining again on the back of mortgage financiers freddie mac and fannie mae and this potential bailout
6563618 youre going to have everyone fearful of the unknown and fearful of bigger writedowns until we see some concrete evidence that the writedowns are slowing and some evidence that u s house price declines are slowing

6563627 i have two kids who both play video games so having this opportunity to star in red alert 3 alongside gina and this cast is a huge honor and i look forward to teaming up with the fans this fall
6563628 this is by far the most exciting cast we have had over the past 13 years of shooting live action movies for command amp conquer
6563629 the caliber of the performances we received both individually and collectively have really raised the storytelling bar for the franchise we are really excited that we will be delivering such a high quality production that is on par with movies and television shows
6563630 i wasnt sure what to expect when i came in to work on a video game
6563631 what i realized is red alert 3 is not just a video game its absolutely an interactive movie this is where the people at home get to move the story forward and where seeing the plot thicken is a reward for a job well done and thats really cool
6563632 i think video games are one of the new frontiers for actors and using live action is just another way to connect more easily to the gamer rather than cg or animation techniques
6563633 to be in a groundbreaking game like red alert 3 where we are using full on shooting of live actors and to be with jonathan pryce tim curry and peter stromare it was a great opportunity for a character actor like me to have some fun

6563655 that to me is the most striking part about it transmitting 60 watts at 75 percent efficiency over several feet
6563656 the power pack for your laptop isnt that efficient its one of those things thats almost too good to be true
6563657 it was a huge act of aggression on the part of the georgian army

6563661 if not for the help of great russia there would have been even more numerous casualties here
6563662 for the ossetian people after the beslan tragedy to lose 2 000 more people is a terrible loss a terrible loss
6563663 only here thanks to this music i feel the fear leaving
6563664 i feel that life is returning to tskhinvali and the music helps me forget the horrors of the bombardment that i went through

6563674 today we face the problem of terror and iran the problem itself is like a swamp with mosquitoes its preferable to dry out the swamp than try to kill every single mosquito
6563675 when the price of oil rises the terrorist organizations feel better this feeling needs to be brought back down the way to bring iran venezuela and even russia in some respects down is to lower the price of oil attacking oil fields is foolish we can attack with energy meaning create alternative energy

6563677 let me say that i dont disagree with anything you said thank you and i am grateful for your support of all of our veterans

6563679 is vacationing in the caribbean and went to a local hospital as a precaution for some discomfort he was feeling due to heartburn and gastroenteritis it was definitely was not a heart attack he is fine and healthy and enjoying the rest of his vacation traveling in the caribbean

6563682 when you impair blood flow from the heart the tissue will die and then as a consequence of that poor blood flow it affects the arrhythmia thats were the defibrillator will come into play

6563685 i was pained and angered by the atrocities against muslims worldwide and the turning point was the demolition of the babri masjid and the gujarat riots only made matters worse
6563686 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
6563687 all this talk about creation of indian mujahideen images needs to be probed i would not be surprised if such an organization has been floated by fundamentalist bodies like the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or vishwa hindu parishad with the sole intention of defaming muslims
6563688 i am not giving any clean chit to anyone but the manner adopted by the investigating agencies speaks of a blatant bias and a predetermined approach
6563689 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
6563690 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists

6563696 at the end of the day it is a station wagon and were very proud of that
6563697 im pretty sure were at or very close to the bottom here in true values the only thing that could throw things out of whack is if there is a nasty recession or a year or two of nasty inflation that would push interest rates up and prices would have to come down but i dont see either one of those happening so i think were very close to the bottom
6563698 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
6563699 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
6563700 we have to keep moving if we rest we will lose the momentum from the successful armm automated elections we were able to proclaim the winner in two days if we can do it faster in 2010 and proclaim the president in one day it will be better
6563701 i asked them to do it as soon as possible there are a lot of things to be done we still have to bid the automation project and decide
6563702 i still dont know how it will work commissioner leonida will report to us
6563703 when we look at the 2010 elections we will once again look at all possible technologies we will do procurement from the very beginning definitely omr and dre will be strongly considered
6563704 its up to the advisory council to tell us they will study the glitches of course the cost is a big factor
6563705 at the latest on january 2009 we would be giving out our invitations to bid to the providers
6563706 by the first quarter of 2009 we shall be making our decision on whom we shall get as providers at the latest march of 2009 we will begin training again etc
6563707 it will not be economically feasible to do 100 percent dre roll out for 2010 one of the things were really looking for in the armm polls is how the two systems can work together

6563712 the conventional homebuyer programs have pretty much all done away with doing this this is something that has been specific to fha loans for quite some time
6563713 move up their time frame to buy a home a little quicker
6563714 is one of the things that is getting more people into the housing market when this is what we really need to get the economy going
6563715 it doesnt seem like the timing of the ban makes sense
6563716 this doesnt mean the bad guys wont chop it up
6563717 but when you start taking peoples ashes thats kind of morbid
6563718 young babies are much more sensitive to narcotics than adults even if you calculate per dose
6563719 the safety of patients who use our products is a priority for the company
6563720 tylenol 3 prescription tylenol with codeine is a safe and effective product when used according to the approved prescribing information
6563721 others will judge what ive done and what i may have done they dont like
6563722 i like to read history but its not my thing to write it i dont keep diaries i dont do all that thats probably one of my problems now that i dont keep diaries
6563723 it is an election like no other the republican party is in just a huge disarray right now
6563724 the corruption investigations have caused people just to rethink what theyre going to be doing i think the vast majority of voters today dont know how theyre going to vote
6563725 the only republican who can win in november and live to carry on the fight against the liberals in washington
6563726 i think as people have got to know me in the campaign they know thats not true and the interesting thing about all that is the justice department has now filed a motion they said theres no legitimate doubt that ted stevens lives full time in washington d c i live full time in anchorage
6563727 this year what one sees is the blossoming of trees planted in 84 and 88
6563728 i wanted to make sure the media saw this not just as a three year race with a phenomenal guy but a 54 year race with a phenomenal guy
6563729 within his body is the dna of reconciliation that is the key to the kingdom the healing closing the gap
6563730 and i just took a deep breath after i cried because i knew it was the last lap of a 54 year race
6563731 this has been a victory for barack and his family because they have run a very astute smart well thought through campaign
6563732 it was a victory for the civil rights struggle because the fruits of our labors have produced the platform from which he could be launched and win and its a victory for america this is a redemptive moment for america its a transformative moment
6563733 and i felt that the value of keeping the party together was worth the hit that we took
6563734 you can agree to disagree but theres a higher prize
6563735 they were our liberal allies we assumed that once we made a great break politically they would be with us
6563736 but once we moved to self determination a number of our allies backed up they wanted to represent us not be our partners in politics
6563737 i said somebody has to run and in the meantime the crowds around run jesse run kept getting louder and louder
6563738 registering voters was winning bringing in new people was winning learning how to run a convention on the floor was winning having our own trailer was winning having access to the mic was winning having access to the national press corps was winning having our issues on the front line was winning so we began to define winning in many long range terms
6563739 you look through the tv lens and you see blacks in chicago unemployed you think they are lazy they dont want to work
6563740 they came to work the jobs left they see you through the tv lens youre not working they think youre getting a subsidy because you feel privileged you get a subsidy because the big farmers corporate farmers took your farm you guys have an awful lot in common
6563741 the farmer said to me you know we hear what youre saying and we think youre right
6563742 and we shook hands i embraced their children i kissed their children
6563743 their children 24 years later are there now because of a cultural transformation in our society because america is becoming more mature less anxious less reactive on the question of race and gender
6563744 people begin to get used to seeing a person of color on that stage debating these issues
6563745 were glad youre in but if you dont want to be in tomorrow night you dont have to be because were going to debate foreign policy
6563746 you know we came here on foreign policy slavery was a foreign policy it was a bigger foreign and trade policy than was banking and insurance i understand foreign policy maybe the best
6563747 i knew that in time we could break through these ancient cultural barriers
6563748 aug 28 1955 emmett till lynched a very low moment in american history really state sanctioned terror
6563749 aug 28 1963 dr king speaks in washington about a dream a dream beyond the predicament of that day to end apartheid aug 28 2008 barack will be nominated in denver nominee of the democratic party for the presidency what a growth in a country
6563750 well you know clearly he must acknowledge this is a high point in americas struggle to make this a more perfect union its a time to heal the breach
6563751 theres unfinished business i am not at all romantic about the structural inequality and the gaps yet to be closed and the healing that must take place but were getting there
6563752 i think that what barack must show is that from the vantage point of that mountaintop how to get all of us into that promised land
6563753 certainly we continue to ask for as much transparency as possible
6563754 we would of course welcome that the areas are genuinely used
6563755 i think everybody has the right to speak this is not the same as demonstrating
6563756 the detention and harassment of those who tried to take the government at its word shows the lengths to which the authorities will go to keep people from peacefully expressing their views
6563757 she told our officer that she was buying the drugs for her son
6563758 im not going to just crawl under a bridge and die so i go into areas where people have money and i approach them

6563765 i had one the other day who said ive been walking for a month ive been going 15 minutes every morning and wake up early but ive only lost four pounds and im like thats good youre losing two pounds a week because from may 12th to now im right about 2 3 pounds a week
6563766 it was a huge act of aggression on the part of the georgian army
6563767 this is not yet a known story to the world
6563768 but i am sure that every day every hour the truth will be coming through
6563769 to you the living and the dead to you south ossetia
6563770 what i have seen today is stalingrad it is complete destruction
6563771 if not for the help of great russia there would have been even more numerous casualties here
6563772 for the ossetian people after the beslan tragedy to lose 2 000 more people is a terrible loss a terrible loss
6563773 only here thanks to this music i feel the fear leaving

6563775 music has reminded me that life is not only war

6563779 we were ready for this test and it was a test
6563780 they played a great game even when we werent making our shots they seemed to be making everything we never got rattled we stayed poised and our defense really led us through this
6563781 we knew it wasnt going to be easy as russia is a very balanced team
6563782 they were committed to get the ball out of my hand i did my best sometimes thats better than other days
6563783 our defense was constant we knew that as long as we kept getting stops wed be okay
6563784 we knew that at some point in the olympics wed have a rough offensive game
6563785 dawn staley pulled me aside and told me that i should start being more aggressive
6563786 we came out anxious on offense i know i was nervous before the game
6563787 these games are always more trouble than the gold medal ones
6563788 wait a minute these food sticks used to be taters you take yer black magic food somewhere else thank you very much
6563789 when asked by a usa today reporter about her upcoming projects jen pointed at her bulging bump and said

6563793 in the environmental movement every time you lose a battle its for good but our victories always seem to be temporary and we keep fighting them over and over again
6563794 and with the manufacturing capacity intel brings to any market
6563795 i wont celebrate until the workers walk back across the sills to return to work but certainly this is positive news
6563796 we are still working towards securing fights to and from fort mcmurray we continue to work on infrastructure development and work projects to keep our residents working
6563797 my understanding is that canfor will appeal that ruling so there is still some work to be done on that matter
6563798 kihn recently discussed his new life as a walking talking sphincter with newsweeks brian braiker
6563799 well are you just going to sit there or are you going to help me
6563800 why should i bother nothing i do is good enough anyway
6563801 why should i bother nothing i do is good enough anyway
6563802 tell me we did have a shitty time didnt we
6563803 how much is it going to cost to let this thing go away
6563804 what kind of animal are you why didnt you wipe
6563805 well who told ya to jab your finger in my pooper couldnt you smell i just shit what would possess you to jab your finger in my ass
6563806 oh dont get uptight she was just talking about her shit
6563807 well you havent experienced a full frontal assault of my depravity
6563808 i sit in the next office over i hear everything just because i dont come in here to join you guys i sit at my desk and laugh my ass off
6563809 and when he pulled his finger out of my ass he stood there in the shower admonishing me because there was shit on his finger
6563810 hey dont get uptight its not like he pulled his finger out and it looked like he dipped it in brownie batter it was a fleck not quite a dingleberry more like the size of a red pepper flake youd put on pizza
6563811 we want to take you out for lunch to celebrate administrative assistants day where do you want to go
6563812 can we go to xyz italian place i was there friday and i really like their rolls
6563813 he is still alive and hes in very poor condition
6563814 we had expert advice that the animal probably would not make it through the night
6563815 it was suffering extremely so weve had to make the very difficult decision
6563816 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6563817 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6563818 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
6563819 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
6563820 its great that we have wireless email and wireless internet and stuff like that but at the end of the day it would be nice to have wireless recharge as well
6563821 that to me is the most striking part about it transmitting 60 watts at 75 percent efficiency over several feet
6563822 the power pack for your laptop isnt that efficient its one of those things thats almost too good to be true
6563823 for me its like a confirmation that its so exciting its something people would like to have
6563824 now the question is if its feasible or not its exciting that theyre also inspired and it seems closer to reality every day
6563825 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6563826 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6563827 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
6563828 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
6563829 its great that we have wireless email and wireless internet and stuff like that but at the end of the day it would be nice to have wireless recharge as well
6563830 the pullback of russian forces is taking place at such a tempo that by the end of august 22 they will be in the zones of responsibility of russian peacekeepers
6563831 we are waiting for the russians to respect their word
6563832 we waited twice with dashed hopes this time it appears that there is at least the beginning of a fulfillment
6563833 there has not been much evidence of any significant russian withdrawals there have been what i would call some minimal movements to date
6563834 its not they its we who will erase them from the face of earth
6563835 what i have seen is stalingrad it is complete destruction
6563836 we want everyone to know the truth about the terrible events in tskhinvali with the hope that such a thing will never again happen on our land
6563837 when will ms crm 4 0 support this new wonder child

6563839 to save lives and to protect property public health and safety
6563840 a slow motion toward the west northwest is forecast to begin soon and continue for the next couple of days
6563841 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make us5 million a5 7 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6563842 does a guy who made more than us4 million a4 6 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6563843 i think if you are just talking about income how about us5 million a5 7 million
6563844 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6563845 major league baseball and the media they want instant replay and were going to have instant replay so if it delays the game then theres nothing we can do about it
6563846 hopefully they let the pitchers have a few pitches just to make sure theyre loose
6563847 i thought it was going to be in the dugout i thought it was going to be in a camera well but it sounds like its just going to be away from the field

6563850 hes not dane cook hes got a more sophisticated everyday take on things he often comes across as a questioner of conventional wisdom but also can be kind of a crank its a fine line to walk when youre dealing with a younger person
6563851 ive never been uncomfortable with that aspect i dont feel like its beneath me to sell what i did
6563852 there was an altercation involving an unknown male who obviously threw something through a window
6563853 there was a smash it the object must have been alight because it ignited the curtains and the house went up
6563854 i was there eight minutes later and it was just destroyed
6563855 through their heroics they entered there and retrieved one male who was nearly unconscious he was unable to get out on his own
6563856 they went back in to retrieve the woman couldnt find her and they found she gained access to the rear of the premises and was in the back yard
6563857 we wont know what he threw through the window until the forensics get there we dont know if he had some sort of accelerant or if things just went up themselves
6563858 he tried to have a tough exterior like a shield to fit in
6563859 he was a good kid who was dealt some bad cards in life
6563860 it was an individual directing his aggression toward another individual not the school or the students inside the school
6563861 he got shot and started walking and he was holding his chest there was blood everywhere and then he fell and his arm hit me
6563862 what separates poetry from religious dogma is the ability of a poem to speak across time to everyone no matter their world view

6563870 it was a huge act of aggression on the part of the georgian army
6563871 this is not yet a known story to the world
6563872 but i am sure that every day every hour the truth will be coming through
6563873 to you the living and the dead to you south ossetia
6563874 what i have seen today is stalingrad it is complete destruction
6563875 if not for the help of great russia there would have been even more numerous casualties here
6563876 for the ossetian people after the beslan tragedy to lose 2 000 more people is a terrible loss a terrible loss
6563877 only here thanks to this music i feel the fear leaving
6563878 i feel that life is returning to tskhinvali and the music helps me forget the horrors of the bombardment that i went through

6563880 here i remembered that i am a construction worker and that means a creator
6563881 they are able to carry out far more seasoned tactical operations than they had been recently and were paying the price
6563882 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or wounded were consistent with air delivered ordinance
6563883 im assuming that as unemployment rises and inflation pressures subside australian financial conditions will need to be shifted from extremely restrictive to only mildly restrictive
6563884 if that is right the rba probably will be forced to return standard mortgage rates from 9 1 2 per cent today to 8 per cent
6563885 over the past two to three weeks there has been a substantial fall in the price of money in the australian marketplace
6563886 thats come about through the reserve indicating there is going to be an interest rate cut over the next few weeks
6563887 what were forecasting through to next year is that those sources of funds will continue to rise and continue to put upward pressure on the banks cost of funds
6563888 it was substantially above the reserves cash rate and its the banks cost of funds that determines the mortgage rate
6563889 every artist you have seen tonight has been influenced by this band and their classic albums

6564116 i took this side journey of about 3 km away from our main force because we kept encountering ss guards and prison inmates and the latter told us of the large camp to the south
6564117 we had been told by our intelligence that we might overrun a large prison camp but we or at least i had no idea of either the gigantic size of the camp or of the full extent of the incredible brutality
6564118 we were tumultuously greeted by what i was told were 21 000 men and what an incredible greeting that was
6564119 i was picked up by arms and legs thrown into the air caught thrown again caught thrown etc
6564120 how the men found such a surge of strength in their emaciated condition was one of those bodily wonders in which the spirit sometimes overcomes all weaknesses of the flesh my but it was a great day
6564121 the worst concentration camp yet to be uncovered by west wall troops
6564122 seeing these things it changes you i was a kid
6564123 des moines had been the furthest id ever been from home i still have horrific dreams usually someone needs help and i cant help them im in a situation where im trapped and i cant get out
6564124 thinking back i would have pushed to be a psychologist if for no other reason than to understand myself better
6564125 memories of evil get erased for life must go on and new generations cannot be locked in the past but they would do well to remember the past
6564126 when the prisoners saw jim they picked him up and threw him in the air thats how happy they were after seeing such horrors prisoners had been hung from hooks to die he saw a lampshade made from a prisoners tattoo jim carried those horrors with him forever he never got what he had seen out of his mind if you ever wondered about jim think about what he saw
6564127 when you were discharged no one really gave a hoot about you it was difficult for a compassionate person like jim to forget what he saw he was a hero
6564128 every year we have 4 million high school students who take general biology and it may be the last biology course they ever take
6564129 if half of them get a contorted or watered down version of evolution then thats a big number these students will go on to sit on school boards and vote in elections
6564130 as scientists we also should make it our responsibility to present the evidence for biological evolution to all of our students especially in introductory courses most students who enroll in our introductory courses will use them as their terminal courses in science at least some of those students will go on to careers as teachers or as public servants who will be asked to make decisions about whether to allow nonscientific approaches to teaching evolution to appear in science curricula
6564131 evolution is one of the most powerful explanations of connectedness we have it provides logic and sense to so much of biology
6564132 high school students who carry a poor or no understanding of evolution into college are less likely to pick careers in the biological and geological sciences the result is fewer scientists
6564133 any statement about lifes origins should be considered as theory not fact
6564134 too often evolution is taught just as a topic not as a repeating theme of biology
6564135 students believe that just because they cant see evolution in action it doesnt exist look the actors on csi a popular television series about solving gruesome murders use evidence to solve an unseen crime there is evidence of evolution all over science
6564136 seen in the light of evolution biology is perhaps intellectually the most satisfying and inspiring science without that light it becomes a pile of sundry facts some of them interesting or curious but making no meaningful picture as a whole
6564137 this is how we were created and you have to believe it on faith
6564138 christianity is not judaism christians are not subject to follow the law jews are that one is a fulfilment of the other does not alter the fact that the ot scriptures do not teach one to do he same things as the nt
6564139 if its not the rule of faith during the apostolic age the the apostles didnt teach it
6564140 as i pointed out before they didnt practice sola scriptura in the ot the sacrificial calendar depends on ex 12 2 is it referring to egyptian months where the jews were living at the time or chaldean months from where their patriarch abraham originated give an answer without oral tradition
6564141 after king solomon had the temple built he sanctified the interior of the courtyard by personally offering sacrifices 1 kings 8 64 how could solomon offer these sacrifices in the temple when every indication in the torah is that only priests may offer sacrifices from where did solomon know that a non priestly king can offer a sacrifice to sanctify the temple if not from an oral law
6564142 elijah offered a sacrifice on mt carmel 1 kings 18 3 38 however the torah forbids bringing sacrifices outside of the temple deut 12 13 14 from where did elijah receive permission to violate this prohibition unless he knew from an oral law that in his case it was permitted
6564143 no one apostle wrote down the whole of revelation no apostle shows evidence of being aware of the whole nt not even close so no apostle could know if all revelation was written thus no apostle could have advocated sola scriptura
6564144 most of the apostles wrote nothing if their imperative was to write scripture most of them botched it
6564145 a fancy sounding distinction that adds nothing to your case the limitations of the individual effectively form part of the criteria because individuals all start from different knowledge and suppositions that protestants wont admit the significant place these internal criteria effect the outcome behind the scenes doesnt mean they dont exist protestants judge by the criteria of their own world view even though they wont admit it
6564146 right so do you grant christianity an epistemologically superior position to those following the koran or vedas if so it must be surely because of the objective nature of christian revelation in comparison to the other claims
6564147 therefore the objective nature of what the church says is canon trumps what steve says is canon
6564148 if you dont grant christianity a superior position you level the church to the ground as i said
6564149 why do you need a rule of faith for the church why not just a rule of faith for individuals the answer is obvious
6564150 you confuse disagreement with disunity the bishops define who is in unity and communion the unity is manifest in the shared eucharist
6564151 i know of no other criteria that would result in a religion short of a direct revelation from god
6564152 they must have been unified since there was only one temple otherwise wed be talking about 5027th temple protestant judaism
6564153 what is passed down over the centuries is what was found workable and true
6564154 youre in no position 2000 years later to distinguish which is which
6564155 you cant communicate with god directly to find out what he inspired
6564156 its only divisive for sorting the wheat from the chaff
6564157 and the chaff are not part of the unity anyway
6564158 unity may not be the only function but it is clearly a function since scripture lists that as a goal for the church
6564159 nonsense i dont ask permission from the magisterium before buying a bible
6564160 i could say the same of the magisterium that of course is the point of issue
6564161 have you told us what a rule of faith is supposed to accomplish so we can take a look at it
6564162 one would think one of the points would be an objective source of truth
6564163 but since youve admitted the necessity of subjective internal light and commentaries some of which may be heretical and reprobational your definition of
6564164 i dont know if im being saved or reprobated by what i think this means thats orwellian perspicuity
6564165 in the same way that if i met the apostle paul and told you what he said it would be an improvement over you privately interpreting genesis on your own despite my fallibility in conveying it to you
6564166 if you could interview 100 people who could relate to you what paul said youd be in a better position still
6564167 the more you care to take in from the spirit led church the better you would be even though individual parts could be fallible
6564168 and if the 100 people compare notes and agree that the truth is around the centre of their collective memory the fallibility of the trees does not hurt the sufficiency of the forest in establishing truth
6564169 and the objectivity of 100 people comparing notes is far in excess of 1 person with their bible under a tree or even 1 person under a tree with a possibly reprobational commentary
6564170 we dont know that he was a fully fledged convert there were a lot of hangers on to the outskirts of judaism he may have been a convert
6564171 classic example of how you treat your own interpretation as functionally infallible
6564172 this implies that he was a jew or at least a proselyte coming from the diaspora
6564173 but fallible oral communication that was informed by the tradition of the catholic church
6564174 he didnt have the gospels or romans because they didnt exist so at least one ethiopian went home informed by a non sola scriptura hermeneutic
6564175 church office is not dynastic by blood but by succession very similar
6564176 irreproachable married only once temperate self controlled decent hospitable able to teach
6564177 just because im from the tribe of levi of the right age and gender didnt give me the right to overthrow the levitical priesthood and temple and start a new cult
6564178 what i said stands it took a special intervention by the messiah to overthrow the authority structure
6564179 youre trying to split the hair between true and infallibly true
6564180 if i relate to you what paul said it is true but not infallible because i related it to you
6564181 otherwise paul left his churches en route at least the ones prior to his writing spree without an authority which would be unworkable
6564182 do we need it since youve already admitted the necessity of commentaries but you cant be sure if they are reprobational then clearly we need something id prefer something guaranteed to be correct than that which may or may not be reprobational but we both agree we need something
6564183 and again back to your presupposition that the canon should be widely known because of the purpose god has for his word
6564184 the same supposition says that interpretation should be widely known
6564185 but your world view says for a thousand years it was not known even though you accept the decision about the canon from those whose interpretation you reject
6564186 any list of books can be defended but individuals will all have their own cut of probabilities of what to include thus the need for some kind of authority whether it be trent or tradition
6564187 by casting out both you cast away your hermeneutical foundation
6564188 the catholic church is objectively the one the apostles founded
6564189 1 you assume apriori that 1tim and 2tim are inspired 2 you assume paul isnt quoting some other now lost writing 3 you assume paul wrote it
6564190 youve just shown your epistemological foundation is viciously regressive what you regard as inspired cannot have the objective foundation as the historical fact that the apostles founded the catholic church
6564191 thats like saying i cant interpret genesis apart from paul the obvious silliness of the accusation is apparent to all
6564192 you need to prove whether apostolic authorship makes something inspired irrespective of what i believe
6564193 irrelevant unless you can produce every non extant ancient document to do an exhaustive search in then youre making a supposition
6564194 before trent we had the tradition and customs of the catholic church same as the jews had
6564195 if i asked you to prove the ot canon youd start talking about what such and such a jew had to say thats an appeal to tradition thats an appeal that assumes a recognisable body of jews existed who held a unified tradition and that the person quoted was a member of said group in short youd be forced to fall back to a tradition based canon
6564196 our job as coaches is to now blend the group of nine returnees and six freshmen to achieve the perfect team chemistry and develop our strongest possible lineup
6564197 she will have to compete for her spot for the first time under my coaching here at three year starter jenkins enters her final season after a solid spring season
6564198 jeanette worked really hard during the off season and had the best spring season out of all nine returners
6564199 she has worked extremely hard on her backcourt game of defense and passing to become a better rounded player individually she is more confident than ever
6564200 in marens first spring at boise state she got to play a lot at the outside position but shined as an attacker on the right side in the small amount of time that she played that position
6564201 during a the broncos junior class features two returners jeanene rose and katie lewis both of whom will play roles in the backcourt this season
6564202 jeanenes injuries slowed her down last season but shes always there to compete and achieve
6564203 i look forward to a healthy jeanene this fall that will compete for the starting libero and defensive specialist spots
6564204 kati and we as coaches felt that the best position for her would be in the back row
6564205 she got to train all spring and showed large improvements on her passing and digging
6564206 laurens freshman year of starting at the important libero position is really going to pay off for her and the team going into her sophomore year
6564207 she is incredibly gifted with her backcourt play and could be the favorite to win the libero job again
6564208 emily had the perfect spring for her coming off her freshman fall season
6564209 she will continue to play an important utility role for us this season
6564210 alisha made big improvements and started for us most of the spring season
6564211 she has become very consistent in her attacking the outside hitter position is open for three players to fill two spots this fall and alisha has taken to the challenge to earn her spot
6564212 sadie getting healthy is the most important thing for her and the team
6564213 she has improved more than we could have expected in the past year since she signed with us we will be able to use her athletic ability to be much stronger and more physical at the net
6564214 alexandra was a highly recruited setter who has numerous mvp awards from region and area high school teams as well as club teams
6564215 she is a natural leader and is very clear on what she needs to do to compete for the starting setter spot
6564216 she is known and feared as a tremendous blocker and may become the best blocker on our roster as a freshman
6564217 kaycee can play middle blocker and right side because she is a pure fast athlete who has had excellent club training
6564218 her knowledge of the game and her ability to play at collegiate speed will allow her to compete to play immediately
6564219 as good as an outside hitter that amanda was she is committed to playing back row at

6564346 the first thing i did was a google search for the term that made up the domain name while most of the paying advertisers were large companies i opted to contact several companies who had organic positions in the results page but were fairly low in my experience most companies who have decent rankings but still lower than top 10 would like to do what they can to improve their rankings and they have the knowledge to do this having a top 5 ranking can boost traffic tremendously as i have seen with my own websites and many of these companies need just a bit of an edge to get there
6564347 my pitch was quick as i have found that if you need to extensively explain why a domain name has value it is very difficult to convince someone to spend the money on it the company either gets it or doesnt companies that do get it will end up getting it if you know what i mean
6564348 kahapon lamang kay sarap ng ating pagmamahalan ang sabi mo pa di mo ako iiwan
6564349 what happened was that the milf assembled its forces and our intelligence were able to monitor that but then it turned out that it was just a group of milf teenagers having a night out party the milf intelligence might have monitored our intelligence right ahead of us
6564350 this would be a lot help so we could employ more cigarette vendors in the high threat areas
6564351 nung lumingon ako nagulat ako dahil nakita ko si ano hindi ko na lang babanggitin ang pangalan

6564353 sabi ko uy pasensya na biro lang yung sa akin alam mo na tv yun eh
6564354 and then i almost flipped out when she gave a very deafening shreik and split herself in half leaving her hip and legs below and started to fly by flapping her huge bat like wings
6564355 wala yon naintindihan kita kasi komedyante rin naman ako sa akin tapos na yun

6564359 congress only makes laws not obey them and our executive agencies like the lto are the ones that enforce them to other people
6564360 bradmans sort of heroic status really is part of the national imagination i think theres something there to enjoy all parts really different people draw different experiences from particular items
6564361 the main interactive exhibit is sort of a tank stand and a stump and a golf ball that was a core part of his own development as a player so thats there for people to try out

6564363 the next thing i heard was a big loud crash and i turned right beside me and i turned and i looked and here was this white spot with spider web effect and the only thing i could think of was somebody shot
6564364 the reason we are where we are today is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6564365 heres the story from the new york times about a team of scientists who were able to
6564366 they supposedly fixed the problem which the pilot later said was with the air conditioning and then we took off
6564367 the plane was wobbling from one side to another then i began to suspect we would crash i dont know what happened next i was in a sort of river and saw people smoke explosions which i think woke me up
6564368 wow this is astonishing i admire those people who could withstand our country
6564369 be rest assured that this government is doing everything it can to keep filipinos from staying here in the philippines your humble president is always busy trying to sell our countrymen to the lowest bidding countries for cheap labor
6564370 i said the heck is that and there was an alligator floating by
6564371 i took my flashlight and was like youve got to be kidding me a big old alligator swimming around here
6564372 they are trying to find dry land someplace to hide

6564384 the republicans dont know how to govern but they do know how to politick and win elections
6564385 your friend karl rove recently made some comments about richmond to the effect that this wasnt much of a town and that the fact that gov kaine once led it is of no great significance do you have a response to that and more generally what would your administration do to make the job of people like mayor wilder a little bit easier
6564386 in your page if you have some falimiarity with javascript its almost the same thing to get a dom element

6564388 well as a citizen of this country i am sad that we have to live with worse consequences because you would prefer to vote on some other basis

6564394 this man will just not stay down is there nothing he cant bounce back from
6564395 there were all kinds of buildings destroyed here from schools to hospitals not just this they need to work on the city
6564396 we need to rebuild the golden mosque just like it was before so it can be a symbol of unity
6564397 al qaeda in iraq had the freedom to ride around in pickups with machine guns in the back
6564398 the berm and the towers are overconstructed to send a psychological message people need something to make them feel secure
6564399 i think as an american you just cant understand how scared people are it takes the concrete t walls and the berms and the towers to let people feel safe
6564400 with these attacks theyre sending a message that no one is safe even in an mrap youre not secure
6564401 people have learnt what al qaeda is they were just too strong for us to do anything about it before
6564402 they need to leave our own army can protect us
6564403 seventy per cent of our work now is trying to connect government and essential services 30 per cent is going after the rural support network of al qaeda in iraq
6564404 now the key is bringing in essential services when the economy kick starts placing an ied improvised explosive device for us 100 dh367 is not so attractive
6564405 samarra had such a bad reputation for so long it has been hard to convince people to come down here
6564406 i reopened five months ago but there was no business
6564407 its a little better now but there still arent many customers
6564408 we found the same family that did the original work and they still have the drawings and the details
6564409 i said what the heck is that and there was an alligator floating by
6564410 i took my flashlight and was like youve got to be kidding me a big old alligator swimming around here

6564413 im ready to get back to work this is insane itll drive you nuts being stuck like this
6564414 we are indeed distressed that our previous analysis of this issue was in error
6564415 i cant provide odds on whether dropped votes were not recognized
6564416 but based on what we know about how our customers run their elections and reconcile counts we believe any results not uploaded on election night would have been caught when elections were being certified
6564417 voters in jurisdictions premier serves both in ohio and throughout the country can be assured that election officials employing standard canvass and crosscheck procedures will count their votes completely and accurately
6564418 as far as i know we have not seen that problem
6564419 it is shockingly insensitive that a man who had spoken in such a manner about a minor girl has been reinstated

6564450 the planesense program which allows individuals and companies to purchase shares of aircraft to fit their needs and budgets continues to have confidence that grob will resolve its current difficulties as many aircraft manufacturers have done in similar stages of aircraft development
6564451 if grob should not be able to resolve its current insolvency then there are other options available for the acquisition of turbojet aircraft for the planesense program

6564470 as an educated american with multiple advanced degrees i am deeply saddened that being a pointy headed professor type is considered a negative character trait in this country not only does it offend me personally but more importantly it is precisely this sort of anti intellectual prejudice that is impeding americas ability to compete on the global marketplace where the ability to handle complex intellectual tasks involving information and technology is growing ever more important

6564477 real life goes on its not just about the building and the redskins and here we go and now were playing the it really is about the real life situations and theyre hard
6564478 but the one thing is we have a real tight family in the building when you lose a member it obviously hurts a lot more when youre tight knit but you also know youve got a lot of people around to support you
6564479 we just told him that we love him none of us have gone through that situation some of us have kids and we know how we feel about our own kids he came in and just told us hey love your kids you dont ever know whats going to happen
6564480 he has been very strong very real about this situation
6564481 the conversations hes had with my coaches have been very upbeat talking about the little victories each day each day he has considered a real blessing that his daughter has been alive to communicate with him and her mom i could see the pride he had in how his daughter was fighting this illness thats what came through these last couple of weeks
6564482 it really took my breath away when i saw the message come across my desk
6564483 i just stopped and immediately thought about all the times that we played against each other we didnt like each other when we played against each other but he was a tremendous athlete a tremendous leader he made a very deep mark in the history of the nfl and hell be greatly missed
6564484 i think we are urged within our hearts to press on
6564485 and grit our teeth a little bit and bear down when these things happen
6564486 he just didnt quite give me the full speed that i needed to see
6564487 the size of the future you actually experience will largely be determined by one factor the people you choose to connect with when you invite people who are truly committed to growth into every aspect of your life your own potential for growth becomes truly unlimited
6564488 vytorins effectiveness has been in doubt and now its safety is questionable
6564489 that sir petos work in this matter has somehow been influenced by the companies is insulting to him and entirely untrue
6564490 gt terrorism task force investigates dead foreigner with cyanide be respectful of others and their opinions
6564491 you dont want it to end this way but its all we could do
6564492 have to figure out a way to see all of our friends
6564493 we will never have to say goodbye to our friends and loved ones
6564494 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6564495 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6564496 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
6564497 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
6564498 that stage is over with he doesnt have a choice hes been here since june his freshman period is over with its time to play ball
6564499 were just trying to get the best people on the field and if that means moving people around thats part of it
6564500 probably when were in base ill be sticking with the sam right now thats what we have but when we go into nickel and dime situation we can move people around and put people in different spots
6564501 for the base stuff unless someone goes down which hopefully wont happen ill probably be sticking at sam
6564502 it worked out well in the scrimmage saturday he played well there there was a lot of carryover for him
6564503 were a little short at inside backer in terms of depth but i think we have to play our 11 best players and if he has to double up somewhere inside then thats what he has to do
6564504 he knows what hes doing which is hard to do for freshmen to come in and learn the playbook hes one of the ones whos really stepped up and known what to do it also helps when you have rolando mcclain sitting right next to you
6564505 obviously he was a great linebacker in high school because the instinct comes to him naturally
6564506 playing the most significant roles of any guys who walked on to our team
6564507 i thought we were more aggressive we played more physical on both sides of the ball played with more toughness
6564508 its been very difficult to watch him struggle with his back
6564509 i think its a surprise to so many people because david first of all never complains to anyone
6564510 he never complained to the girls about his back i can tell you that in 2005 when he had back surgery the doctor said he had never done a bigger surgery on anyones back
6564511 i think the magnitude of it no everyone knows and thats the way david is but it was evident to me and my daughters the wear was difficult on him with the recruiting
6564512 some of these kids on our team they just got on campus
6564513 it was sad for me because david is young and is having the pain that hes having
6564514 at the same time im honored to be the one who gets to be mentored by of the best coaches in the country
6564515 how many people in their life get to do something that they absolutely love
6564516 hes the calming influence which well still have hes the technical side of it
6564517 hes talking a little bit more than he usually does motivating guys
6564518 this fall he knows the defense so i dont even have to look over there or worry about whats going on hes making his checks and hes confident in what hes doing out there
6564519 we dont have a strong safety and a free safety
6564520 we have a left safety and a right safety were moving back and forth to see who can do what it might get established later on but its nothing right now
6564521 hes certainly learned more and more and more about playing defense back
6564522 we moved him over and he played linebacker in high school its a little bit of a work in progress to kind of get him to learn all the little innuendo things about playing the deep part of the field hes made a lot of progress hes a lot more confident hes a good tackler
6564523 i was 220 when i weighed in but i dropped down to 213 ill probably be playing around 215
6564524 last year i was a little stressed but i had to work through it just not playing football

6564526 a little more intensity better enthusiasm more guys playing with the kind of intensity wed like to see on a day to day basis i think we made some improvement
6564527 his leadership has been a real positive on the development of our offensive team
6564528 the biggest thing with our young players is they have to be able to stay focused on the process of what they need to do to be complete players at their position
6564529 in some cases they came in and thought they would be able to make a significant impact and some of them will be able to do that
6564530 they tend to personalize everything because theyre frustrated because theyre not getting the kind of results theyd like to get
6564531 they have to be able to not get frustrated and be able to stay focused on the things they need to do to get better
6564532 weve been able to stay fairly healthy knock on wood
6564533 hopefully we can continue to do that and continue to improve as a team and practice smart so well be able to do that
6564534 we try to practice safe and we try to stay off the ground
6564535 we try to play fast play blocks stunt people but we try to stay off the ground
6564536 two guys last year were injured in practice because one guy got cut and another guy got drug down from behind which is not the way we want to do it
6564537 all i can tell you is when i go home at night
6564538 theres always that frustration of not winning the championship youll have to carry that label
6564539 my father carried it for a long time texas coach mack brown carried for a long time ill have to carry it
6564540 i think until you win a championship thats always going to be the analogy and accurately so
6564541 but its amazing how much one more year in the weight room can do one more year on the field
6564542 i think this teams not selfish so i think were going to be fine
6564543 were happy with where were at but were not satisfied
6564544 were in a great position but we cant look ahead
6564545 im really excited being that this is my stomping grounds
6564546 were going to have a whole bunch of guys out here and have a good time
6564547 ive always been proud to sing the latin music like my friend flaco jimenez who ive known too many years how many im not going to say
6564548 the degree to which islamist extremists around the world have dropped their previous obsession with iraq and now focus on the afghan pakistan area has been astounding
6564549 no one recruiting for or seeking to join jihadist fighting in europe are trying to get to iraq its all afghanistan now
6564550 no one raising money for jihad is directing funds to iraq either the afghan pakistan region has regained the power of attraction it had prior to september 11
6564551 theres real concern the already wild and lawless border region will become a virtual taliban al qaeda colony
6564552 it was the original jihad against occupying infidels and it was long al qaedas terror sanctuary bin laden still lurks there somewhere
6564553 afghanistan isnt just about killing americans but fighting the assembled forces of the world they accuse of attacking islam
6564554 beyond the immediate human reaction to this loss of life this attack is most instructive in telling us about the rapidly rising strength and capacity of the people were up against
6564555 the taliban have been allowed to reconstitute and re arm themselves to levels nearing those prior to the invasion
6564556 by casting their vote on the energy security now line hudson valley voters will be saying yes to more drilling yes to safe nuclear energy and yes to the development of alternative energy
6564557 hopefully we can get all the details worked out in the near future
6564558 im not certain it would be wise or prudent to embark on another major fundraising campaign for athletics right now
6564559 we do not want to get out in front of the president
6564560 we are working with architects davis architects of birmingham to be ready when we get the nod from the president we dont know yet when that will be
6564561 same thing though i thought they gave up a couple of big plays and thats always something you always want to guard against
6564562 there was a high difference with some of the young players from last week to this week thats going to be helpful to us from a depth standpoint
6564563 we have a bit of a long jam at running back and were a little thin at linebacker
6564564 we just talked to him yesterday about it well see how it goes at linebacker for a few days
6564565 we scrimmaged him out there some plays today probably didnt know what to do but he went up and tackled the guy with the ball quite a bit i did notice that well see how he develops and thats just kind of a trial right now
6564566 when you give up any big plays it kind of disturbs you
6564567 i think well be a faster unit you definitely see a difference in the guys and the attitude on the field in getting more guys to the ball
6564568 you wont see many times in which just one guy makes a tackle its your going to see a lot more guys swarming to the ball because thats something theyre emphasizing every day
6564569 they throw a deep ball and they want the defensive linemen to take off running you never know anything could happen fumble anything
6564570 he has made a significant improvement in weight management discipline
6564571 hes in the 365 range i think we wanted him at 366 365 i dont know that hes going to be able to lose a whole lot more weight than that right now its his conditioning and his ability to sustain
6564572 hes a presence in the middle and pushes the pocket hes difficult to block hes made a contribution to the defense in the middle theres no question about that especially on run downs
6564573 i found a really good spot between antoine and andre i dont think theres any player in the conference who could ask to be in a better place
6564574 obviously between andre and antoine they make you better and you want to be better they dont take no for an answer
6564575 last year we ran pretty good and we had a freshman running back who was ready to run i think we can come into this year and do bigger things were a veteran group we have seniors and juniors across the line and theres no reason why we shouldnt do that
6564576 thats probably the most important thing they harped on us during the offseason
6564577 offensive coordinator jim mcelwain he calls certain plays personality plays he calls the red zone the compete zone thats what we have to do down there and do a lot better job down there
6564578 believe it or not its just like justin is there
6564579 hes smart hes athletic justin was athletic he didnt skip a beat
6564580 it just depends how you adjust to the person whos on the side of you
6564581 he helps me in certain situations and i help him in certain situations with the left side of the line being a unit
6564582 a year from now we can say that our community has an effective coalition to address unmet needs on a long term basis so that its there next time as well
6564583 i told him that i was offering him the position that hes taken now
6564584 i also told him that i was aware that a lot of people would like to have my job but i like it too
6564585 i think mal wants me to be involved with that
6564586 my understanding is that all facets of the department will report through me to coach moore i would think that he wants me to be involved in every aspect of the program
6564587 i was coaching as an assistant on paul bryants football staff when dave was playing basketball in the early 1970s so when the opportunity came up to visit with dave i wanted to do so
6564588 he came up during basketball season and stayed here three or four days at the time there wasnt any more thought behind it it was just a visit but later i thought he would be really good for our department and felt that hiring hart would give me an opportunity to do some of the things i want to accomplish
6564589 price told me that there was no problem with hiring dave hart
6564590 in fact he said that hart had taken the high road in this
6564591 my visit with dr robert witt the president of ua made a great impression on me
6564592 it just feels good to be here it feels good in my guts it feels good in my heart
6564593 this place is very very special our past is very important our present is very special but i am focused on the future
6564594 i feel like every program should excel when coaches have facilities resources and administrative commitment you should expect excellence
6564595 at the same time everything ebbs and flows on the heels of what football accomplishes
6564596 blessed to be coming back to alabama at this particular time
6564597 nicks vision where he wants to go was part of my reason for coming here
6564598 right now i am just trying to listen and learn its important to gain knowledge of the existing structures i want to get a feel for things and then discuss with mal if we need to do anything differently i didnt come because i thought mal was ready to retire because i know hes not
6564599 i also wanted to do something i was passionate about i am passionate about this place this is a very very special place

6564616 i probably could have told you that when you came here you would probably get extended
6564617 were not big enough to do both iraq and afghanistan
6564618 when we were getting ready to deploy you i predicted that commanders are going to fall in love with us were going to do a hell of a job and were going to be asked to extend and asked to replace you with more marines i predicted that
6564619 the biggest population of the marine corps is the nco and below population and we trust you we push leadership down to you and you never fail us we know that youll do the right thing all the time
6564620 you know people say the corps is the most feared and respected fighting force in the world its because of warriors like you we are extremely proud of you
6564621 this was a big honor how many people can say they have been reenlisted by the commandant
6564622 you look on the certificate and it has the commandants name on it its a very rare thing
6564623 marines war hardened veterans of previous wars they talk to us all the time and they tell us thank those marines because theyre truly living up to their expectations
6564624 as a matter of fact the veterans will even say most of the time that youre better than they were and that says a lot it is marines like you that will carry the corps for years to come the marines who just reenlisted you are going to take the corps to the next level

6564627 good morning on july 7 though still in bed my thoughts go out to you my immortal beloved now and then joyfully then sadly waiting to learn whether or not fate will hear us i can live only wholly with you or not at all yes i am resolved to wander so long away from you until i can fly to your arms and say that i am really at home with you and can send my soul enwrapped in you into the land of spirits yes unhappily it must be so you will be the more contained since you know my fidelity to you

6564653 part of our theory on the case dealt with merrills research
6564654 this story about john mccain losing track of how many houses he owns is a telling moment that helps to explain why he still thinks the fundamentals of our economy are strong and why he offers just more of the same economic policies that weve gotten from president bush for the last eight years
6564655 couldnt count high enough apparently to even know how many houses he owns
6564656 contrast ing americans struggle to pay their mortgages with mccains optimistic talk on the economy and his personal wealth
6564657 seven houses and heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6564658 find floridians who like mccain have lost track of the number of homes they own
6564659 if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6564660 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6564661 a sharp new line of attack that mccain is out of touch with the economy in part because hes so rich
6564662 it fits perfectly into obamas out of touch washingtonian versus new ideas for todays world frame
6564663 its hard to imagine a worse place in human history to be a woman there are clinics in this region that will treat 8 000 rape victims this year these are 8 000 women whose lives and families have been ripped apart together shootq and my photography will rally awareness about one of the most terrible crises in the world
6564664 powerful images spur powerful action we created the shootq grant to help photographers use their talent and passion to inspire change

6564666 the intense pervasive coverage of the beijing olympics has opened chinas unique diverse culture to millions of people worldwide
6564667 my family and i recently returned in june from an 18 day luxury tour of china that included beijing shanghai guilin zhongdian chengdu where we had a private audience with a baby panda at the panda research center and hong kong and we were overwhelmed with the beauty art history warmth and genuine kindness of the chinese people the introduction of the first luxury cruiser plying the yangzi the yangzi explorer adds another jewel to a china private tour itinerary a post olympics private luxury tour of china is a journey you and your family will cherish forever
6564668 that i could be painting your toenails right now that i could see you do that little cheerleader move that i could be your human lollipop that i could take a shower in your shower with all that girly stuff
6564669 ty thank you for doing the bikini walk i thought to myself as others were checking you out she woke up next to me this morning
6564670 ive reconciled with my family and im pleased to report i am happily married
6564671 no rules were broken no laws were broken i broke my marriage vows
6564672 i hate you i knew you were lying but i was so stupid you scumbag f off leave me alone and go be with your other girlfriends
6564673 on paper were much stronger and its a good draw for us but in a race to eight anything can happen
6564674 maybe its a good tactic to practice with them beforehand as they dont live too far away last year we saw lots of belgian fans and a lot of dutch fans so there will be a big crowd the bigger the better
6564675 if you look at the level of pool in belgium and holland then theres not much rivalry as we have better players in holland but belgium finished fifth in last years world cup
6564676 were really looking forward to it and have a good chance to win the whole tournament as were both on the top of our game
6564677 in the last two years especially last year in holland we wanted to win so badly for the dutch public
6564678 we put so much pressure on ourselves that we lost matches but this time we have to go into it with less pressure we have to take it just as any other tournament and see where it ends but im really confident we can do well
6564679 weve lost 7 8 twice now in the second round but i feel we have the quality easily to go all the way
6564680 it would be awesome to win this title in front of the home crowd the dutchies havent won an event yet in holland weve had three semi finalists in the world pool masters but no finalists yet
6564681 i would just love to make the finals together with nick it would be cool to play on the final day in front of a packed house there
6564682 the world cup of pool is a very spectacular event and its cool for the spectators as they see the players consulting each other on occasion and winning or losing together as a team
6564683 straight pool is a very hard game more difficult than 9 ball i think but its good for me to learn because there is so much knowledge in the game i think i did quite well last year for my first time and i hope i do better this year
6564684 gerda and jasmin have enough straight pool knowledge to defeat any mens pro in the event but to win the whole event very unlikely they just dont have the consistency and stamina to get to the very end
6564685 jasmin is definitely favorite to make it out of her group and then in the second stage i put her at 50 50 to make it to the final sixteen a lot of it depends on the draw in the 32 man brackets
6564686 you can read a history book about what happened then or someone will say there were tanks here but when you see these photos you know it was real
6564687 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia when a great power invaded a small neighbor and overthrew its government
6564688 russia never changes theyre incapable of being free so they dont want anyone else to enjoy their freedom
6564689 if you compare slovak and czech reactions there is one key difference the soviets attacked the czechoslovak leadership in prague which many slovaks themselves did not identify with
6564690 compared with czech attitudes in the streets and in political parties anti russian feelings are much more charged than in slovakia
6564691 us efforts to change the strategic balance of power in its favour
6564692 one of the instruments in an extremely dangerous bundle of us military projects involving the one sided development of a global anti missile system
6564693 i hope that there are not people in russia who are hankering for the days of u s soviet confrontation because they are over
6564694 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defense
6564695 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6564696 it is our understanding that other nato countries will receive similar notes
6564697 temporary decisions are being taken on current cooperation and not about cooperation in general
6564698 military naval exercises in the far east the mediterranean in the baltic
6564699 evidence shows that al bashir masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part the fur masalit and zaghawa groups on account of their ethnicity
6564700 we live as if we are natives here we feel that this is our country and this is our town
6564701 there is no such thing as arab or african we are all sudanese
6564702 thats my friend abubakr hes from the african tama tribe
6564703 there are problems in darfur but they are not between people they are related to the government and to politics
6564704 no single tribe in sudan can claim it is purely african or arab
6564705 the government made use of the conflict in darfur in a kind of non thoughtful way
6564706 it was not sensitive to the tribal relationships the tribal history of the area and the resources
6564707 the disputes between the arabs and people in darfur originate from different reasons grazing pastures natural things they are not rooted in race
6564708 the arabs that are here have nothing to do with this
6564709 who supported them who gave them the guns wasnt it the government
6564710 i can interact with arabs at work or in general ways but when it comes to close relationships i feel there is a wall between us
6564711 we were still looking for dichotomy of some kind something that would explain what was going on easily and simply we latched onto the arab african dichotomy which did vast damage then as the conflict developed it became a reality on the ground it became something by which people explained the conflict themselves
6564712 four attacks in two days ships being hijacked and crews being taken and large ransoms being demanded is completely unacceptable
6564713 this is the worst number of attacks that we have seen in a short period of time for years
6564714 give piracy a much higher priority to bring this under control there have been seven vessels hijacked since the 20th of july
6564715 they have some of their vessels which are tracking some of these hijacked ships but the problem is its very difficult to take action once the hijackers are on board
6564716 we are ok but our drinking water supply is a problem
6564717 we want to get you back to your village as soon as possible
6564718 the present situation in mindanao leaves us no choice but to review and revisit the provisions contained in the memorandum of agreement
6564719 she arroyo will seek peace within the boundaries of law set within the constitution
6564720 negotiations honest negotiations can only happen and become effective only in an atmosphere of peace and tranquility
6564721 we cannot allow a situation where we talk peace we undertake a peace process and the parties concerned are taking up arms
6564722 its been three years and eight months they studied it and scheduled the signing and then they cancel everything what is that
6564723 we discovered that it was ok to have a little high brow as long you have a lot of low brow thats entertainment value the one thing you want to avoid is the middle brow because the whole world is frigging middle brow at the moment
6564724 it should be in every rucksack for those times when soldiers need spiritual energy
6564725 behind the world food crisis is a global freshwater crisis expected to rapidly worsen as climate change impacts intensify
6564726 irrigation fed agriculture provides 45 percent of the worlds food supplies and without it we could not feed our planets population of six billion people
6564727 the whole question of undeclared money is not just a liechtenstein problem but an international one
6564728 we are delighted to be working with contec on the delivery of live mobile sports content this in demand and authoritative content delivered to virtually any mobile device adds the next generation of services and complements the games ringtones and social community features we provide to mobile subscribers across china
6564729 commercially launching the premier league service with justel is a great start to feeding chinas surging appetite for global sports information
6564730 mobile data services are well entrenched last year china unicom generated approximately 3 billion in value added service revenue while text messaging volume itself reached a staggering 92 billion messages our live service will undoubtedly find a market that is keen for up to the minute soccer news and is already accustomed to using mobile data services
6564731 we are honored to provide financial support for moving this project forward
6564732 i want to leave a legacy at msu that will enable continued growth and excellence in the nursing program as an operating room nurse for more than 25 years i have witnessed firsthand the severity of the nursing shortage i want to ensure that quality nursing care is available for all us in our time of need
6564733 community involvement and philanthropy are very important to our lives
6564734 we are passionate about supporting projects that will help bring an end to the national nursing shortage
6564735 this gift will have a profound impact on generations of nursing students michigan state university and has transformed the dream of the nursing addition into a reality
6564736 notably this gift is the single largest philanthropic commitment in the colleges history
6564737 bernadette marquez endorsement of this project embodies her personal value of the education she received and the couples belief that a nursing education from michigan state university should be accessible to future generations of students at all levels
6564738 in response to the national nursing and nursing faculty shortage and in anticipation of support for a nursing addition the university created a doctor of philosophy in nursing program in the fall of 2000 and strategically increased total enrollments in the college of nursing more than 110 percent from 2003 to 2007
6564739 we now need to focus on expanding the physical capacity to accommodate our enrollment growth
6564740 i am honored to be a part of marking a new era of excellence in nursing education at michigan state university
6564741 i hope others will join my husband and me in this challenge to be a part of history
6564742 anticancer research is aimed at understanding the molecular pathways hat can be selectively targeted to halt tumor growth
6564743 we know that the mtor pathway is activated in many cancers and therefore is a good target for fighting a wide array of tumors
6564744 we analyzed tissue from human biopsies as well as cancer cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models of cancer
6564745 this study inserts a new piece of information into the puzzle of the effects of mtorc1 inhibitors in cell signaling
6564746 furthermore because there are inhibitors of mapk pathway already approved for the treatment of cancer it provides us with the rationale for using combinations of mtorc1 and mapk inhibitors in attacking tumors thereby offering cancer patients another treatment option with immediate applicability
6564747 but the point is you want to be able to communicate in your native language
6564748 they also cost more we dont think its fair for someone whos deaf to have to pay more for his or her cell phone than someone whos hearing
6564749 to really improve adolescent health programs should seek to reduce risk taking improve social capital and improve levels of affluence
6564750 overall assessments of health may be an important measure for different reasons than more specific and detailed measurements it is a holistic approach as opposed to a specific approach
6564751 our analysis actually states that social capital affluence and risk taking all influence health but these things do not work together
6564752 the requirements outlined in the proposed regulation will give pregnant and nursing women and their clinicians important and detailed information that will improve treatment decisions and health care outcomes
6564753 beyond labeling of current know risks we need more research to understand how medical treatments affect pregnant women and their children
6564754 these groups have not been adequately studied in the past so we cant conclude that research on medication use in the general population will apply to them this is an important point that holds true for all medical research
6564755 we know there are substantial differences between women and men and among different racial and ethnic groups in health and disease including responses to treatments research studies must be designed and analyzed with a focus on group differences if scientists dont ask questions about how women children minorities or the elderly might be affected differently and publish the results our understanding of population differences will never grow and well struggle to close gaps in health outcomes for these groups
6564756 our goal is to make discoveries that will ultimately allow us to intervene with the most effective early therapy before a mild traumatic brain injury results in a chronic problem
6564757 there is a high prevalence of mild traumatic brain injury in soldiers and the consortiums work is driven by that we believe the conclusions of our research also will benefit civilians including athletes who have suffered concussions
6564758 the award of this grant confirms the collaborative platform of mission connect is a powerful and pivotal force in research
6564759 uniting these premier scientists in this shared research effort will accelerate the pace of discovery and provide the courageous men and women in our military with the best possible medical care for the brain injuries they have sustained
6564760 this grant is a huge boost to research in traumatic brain injury and will allow investigators to work together through mission connect
6564761 for baylor college of medicine it will help fund 10 investigators in neurology neuroscience neurosurgery and pain management and physical rehabilitation
6564762 only through collaboration can we make great strides in restoring function for our young brave men and women in the armed forces
6564763 we in the medical field must serve these men and women by moving the frontiers of treatment faster to provide state of the art interventions now
6564764 an effort led by drs doug dewitt and donald prough of the moody center for brain and spinal cord injury mission connect at utmb is a pivotal component of the department of defense project leading the field with a new blast injury model that simulates the exposure to improvised explosive devices additionally innovative therapies using stem cells anti inflammatory agents growth hormones and the expertise of aggressive rehabilitation at the transitional learning center round out the critical components of utmbs efforts
6564765 oxidative stress is a prominent feature of traumatic brain injury
6564766 we have developed a new antioxidant agent based on carbon nanotubes and in collaboration with dr thomas kent of the baylor college of medicine we will examine the therapeutic potential of the agent to treat mild tbi
6564767 our ability to apply novel intervention strategies to nervous system trauma based on the cellular and molecular biology observations made over the years would suggest that we will be able to make an impact on the treatment modalities to be developed over the next five years
6564768 at utmb the neuroscience research community has a long tradition of excellence dedicated to the understanding of trauma to the nervous system we are very happy to be able to make a contribution to this joint texas effort in what is an exemplary example of translational efforts at utmb
6564769 the institutions that make up mission connect have a long history of working together successfully this significant grant is testament to the fact that our collaboration makes us more competitive for funding than any one of our schools would have been alone and more importantly it strengthens our ability to improve the lives of those affected by traumatic brain injury
6564770 the award is very forward thinking since in addition to clinicians it includes neuroscientists working to elucidate the very basic and fundamental causes of nervous system injury all the way down at the molecular and cellular level
6564771 at present we know very little about how brain injury disrupts the connections and communication among neurons the neuroscientists participating will fill this huge gap in our knowledge armed with this information and working together in a collaborative environment clinicians and neuroscientists stand a much better chance of designing new and innovative treatments for traumatic brain injury
6564772 congratulations to dr valadka and the team for receiving this very prestigious and competitive funding which will improve our knowledge of the complex mechanisms involved in traumatic brain injury the awarding of this grant validates our national stature in the neurosciences and will improve patient care and clinical outcomes for many patients
6564773 a model of innovative thinking and close collaboration between multiple institutions to understand and to advance the care of patients with mild traumatic brain injury
6564774 mild traumatic brain injury is a tremendous problem and there is an outstanding team in place ready to tackle it
6564775 this is a serious subject and its a roomful of serious people who have taken it in that manner certainly there are additional discussions that we will have tomorrow
6564776 but for our part we continue to believe that this is a very important initiative and we remain committed to achieving an outcome that is both a net benefit for the non proliferation regime and that meets indias energy needs
6564777 i think there is a lot of support for this internationally and so i remain optimistic that were going to be able to be successful in this process
6564778 well be pressing on the pakistanis themselves to be involved with us in fighting terrorism and making sure the number of terrorists coming into afghanistan from pakistan is limited
6564779 obviously we have had a period of political uncertainty in pakistan i think its very important now that we see the pakistan and afghan governments working together
6564780 we have obviously also suffered casualties because of the summer offensive
6564781 we have always expected there to be a summer offensive because of the fact that there was very little of a spring offensive
6564782 its a summer offensive of the taliban we will see that happening but in our view our strategy will be to build up the afghan army to build up the rest of afghan society
6564783 sort out the government so that we have a full attack on corruption
6564784 we want to see on the ground the delivery of results
6564785 in relation to foreigners holding demonstrations in beijing in support of tibet independence competent authorities have the right to handle these things according to law
6564786 id also like to emphasize that in china activities that support tibet independence will be strongly condemned by the chinese people and will not be welcomed
6564787 in another case petitioners wu dianyuan 79 and wang xiuying 77 were sentenced to one year of
6564788 lets make protestors apply to demonstrate that will make it way easier to round them up and send them to labor camps
6564789 und wenn sie nicht gestorben sind dann leben sie noch heute
6564790 when it comes to founders we know we are usually going to see something odd
6564791 in some cases they are exorbitantly paid and in others they are paid miserly
6564792 as of now there are no plans for me to be on the show
6564793 i hope it turns out to be a really great show just for my dads legacy i was originally a part of 90210 and it was something pretty phenomenal so i hope it turns out great
6564794 i know shannen probably doesnt share the feelings that i have for tori but i love tori like my sister
6564795 trains are a part of our history that really a lot of people dont think about plus it makes things a little more interesting for people it gives them something to look at
6564796 this is really a collection of a lot of lima history i just think its a really nice idea
6564797 this center has a good deal more room than our old place it has expanded our ability to make things much more comfortable for our patients
6564798 we want to bring in a team of experts in contracting and agreements to do a thorough review so we can do the right thing
6564799 we realize after the initial reading that theyve done their investigation but have not done the verification
6564800 the greatest assembly for a redress of grievances that this capital has ever seen
6564801 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
6564802 t here will be neither rest nor tranquility in america until the negro is granted his citizenship rights
6564803 the whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges
6564804 of their self hood and robbed them of their dignity
6564805 we cannot be satisfied as long as the negros basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one
6564806 no community in this country can boast of clean hands in the area of brotherhood
6564807 now in the north its different in that it doesnt have the legal sanction that it has in the south but it has its subtle and hidden forms and it exists in three areas in the area of employment discrimination in the area of housing discrimination and in the area of de facto segregation in the public schools and we must come to see that de facto segregation in the north is just as injurious as the actual segregation in the south
6564808 the isolation and intense concentration of minority students in urban schools remains the same
6564809 among the most poor and racially segregated in the nation
6564810 be educated in community conditions of extreme poverty and racial isolation
6564811 sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination
6564812 on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity
6564813 these musicians speak to millions of people every day so for them to use their voices to inspire people is a key part of our program
6564814 i ran a couple back for touchdowns but then they started kicking away from me
6564815 we definitely need to bounce back from last year on kickoff returns
6564816 my knee might not have been bad but i was kind of scared that it wasnt 100 percent
6564817 it took me awhile to realize that i could move it and run at full speed we got a little break after the bcs game and when i came back and started working out i realized there was nothing wrong with the knee
6564818 i didnt know what to expect i was kind of nervous i wouldnt have full range of motion in my knee but it was a minor surgery so it wasnt anything to worry about the speed hasnt gone away
6564819 it will be really interesting just from a fly on the wall perspective to see how things operate
6564820 im not entirely sure whats going to occur but i think it will be fun
6564821 the events are really varied and diverse and i want to take in as much as possible
6564822 denver is a really neat community and each days schedule is completely full
6564823 while the nation is focused on the 2008 presidential election there is a battle going on right now at the state level for the heart and soul of our country
6564824 project 2010 puts us at the forefront of this fight and positions us for long term success
6564825 we know that real change happens in state capitals and we are doing everything we can to ensure that democratic leadership will continue from 2007 through 2010
6564826 just when we thought we had put finally put tom delay and his shady ways behind us we discover new republican plans to inject politics into redistricting
6564827 we cant let that happen project 2010 is not just a plan to continue positive change in state capitals but it is also the last line of defense against republican attempts to cheat americans out of fair representation in government
6564828 joy needs a better understanding of the nature of evil
6564829 the project will be based upon a successful project on property law by elizabeth townsend gard at seattle law school
6564830 its a great time to visit tweetsie and enjoy all that tweetsie has to offer every day
6564831 we have noticed a lot of families are doing their end of summer family trips
6564832 we wanted to show our appreciation to the community for supporting us this year
6564833 were really excited about working with the mountain times on this project
6564834 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6564835 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6564836 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6564837 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6564838 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6564839 has a background and set of values that you can identify with
6564840 what she doesn t mention is that the helping industry has treated her pretty well in 2006 the chicago tribune reported that mrs obama s compensation at the university of chicago hospital where she is a vice president for community affairs jumped from 121 910 in 2004 just before her husband was elected to the senate to 316 962 in 2005 just after he took office and that does not count the money mrs obama receives from serving on corporate boards
6564841 hey johns got seven or eight residential properties that could be a problem theyll say hes rich and cant relate
6564842 how can we defuse that as an issue and attack obama at the same time
6564843 i got it we get someone on the outside to leak to politico hey why dont you ask him how many houses hes got the answer might make some good copy
6564844 then we drop some fresh dirt about obama and rezko and say wanna talk houses
6564845 which one of these guys do you want to emulate
6564846 too inexperienced for the wh and so very much more
6564847 whats mine is mine and whats yours is mine too
6564848 senator obama chides mccain for his home ownership well what about the fact that his chicago home came courtesy of the now convicted tony rezko who sold the senator a block of land for less than the actual value of the property
6564849 if the desperate obamessiah wants to go down this road then so be it in doing so hes finally going to bring convicted felon tony rezko into the mix
6564850 two years ago obama bought a mansion on the south side in the kenwood neighborhood from a doctor on the same day antoin tony rezkos wife rita rezko bought the vacant lot next door from the same seller the doctor had listed the properties for sale together he sold the house to obama for 300 000 below the asking price the doctor got his asking price on the lot from rezkos wife
6564851 on the same day obama closed on his house rezkos wife bought the adjacent empty lot meeting the condition of the seller who wanted to sell both properties at the same time
6564852 later the obamas bought a 10 foot by 150 foot piece of the lot for 104 500 an appraisal put the value of the strip at 40 500 a spokesman said but obama considered it fair to pay one sixth of the original price for one sixth of the lot
6564853 a federal jury today convicted developer antoin tony rezko of corruption charges for trading on his clout as a top adviser and fundraiser to gov rod blagojevich rezkos guilty verdict on 16 of 24 corruption counts could have broad repercussions for blagojevich who made rezko a central player in his kitchen cabinet it could also prove a political liability for u s sen barack obama who once counted rezko as a friend and fundraiser as the likely democratic presidential nominee heads into the general election campaign against republican john mccain the jury convicted rezko of wire and mail fraud money laundering and aiding and abetting bribery he was acquitted of attempted extortion
6564854 when obama and his wife michelle a hospital executive decided to move with their two young girls from their hyde park condominium they chose a spacious three story georgian revival home on a tree lined street in the kenwood neighborhood not far from the university of chicago the owner had listed the house nearly 100 years old with four fireplaces and a wine cellar and an adjacent lot as separate parcels
6564855 as a state senator barack obama wrote letters to city and state officials supporting his political patron tony rezkos successful bid to get more than 14 million from taxpayers to build apartments for senior citizens
6564856 obamas letters written nearly nine years ago for the first time show the democratic presidential hopeful did a political favor for rezko a longtime friend campaign fund raiser and client of the law firm where obama worked who was indicted last fall on federal charges that accuse him of demanding kickbacks from companies seeking state business under gov blagojevich
6564857 the letters appear to contradict a statement last december from obama who told the chicago tribune that in all the years hes known rezko ive never done any favors for him
6564858 one of them was sen barack obama d ill who was offered a job by rezko in the early 1990s while a top student at harvard law school obama did not take it but over the years the two men stayed in touch
6564859 for the first time sen barack obama put a figure friday to the amount of campaign contributions that indicted political fund raiser tony rezko raised for the senators campaigns and the number about 250 000 was far more than he previously acknowledged
6564860 wed obama and rezko continue to have lunches or breakfasts wed talk about politics wed talk about family
6564861 in terms of other than lunch or breakfast he and i had socially michelle and i probably had a couple of dinners or two or three dinners with rezko and his wife during the course of this six or seven or eight years
6564862 barack and michelle obama visited their home in lake geneva once for the day
6564863 some limited offshore drilling might be conceivable given the right conditions and controls
6564864 some limited offshore drilling might be acceptable given the right conditions and controls
6564865 obama raised by a single mom just recently paid off his student loans worked hard to get into the ivy league earned a salary like most americans recently became moderately wealthy after authoring two best selling books quite the american dream
6564866 mccain ditched his first wife for a young hot heiress worth 100 million after daddy got him into the naval academy despite lackluster academics owns at least 7 homes flies around on his private jet and kicks around in 520 italian loafers
6564867 yeah when it comes to elitism id say mccain is the undisputed champion
6564868 dreams of my drunken one legged polygamist father and my codependent mother
6564869 i have friends who own homes condos and apartment buildings and couldnt tell you on the spot exactly how many
6564870 the most qualified candidate for president is not the most successful business man
6564871 the campaign believes the story about mccains many houses is political gold
6564872 what is worse not knowing how many houses you own or thinking that there are 57 states in the union
6564873 if you ended up married to a multimillionaire heiress would you make her sell all she had and give it to the poor
6564874 this is a laughable attempt to paint senator mccain as an out of touch elitist by the lamestream media
6564875 im the only one the special interests dont give any money to
6564876 earned his wealth cindy is an executive of a large corporation and has done well too she has earned wealth get used to it you jealous little people

6564889 by the way nothing has been disproven by the rezko story once again obama was involved with sleazy chicago politicians an we all know that you cant be involved with chicago politics without being sleazy just ask daley
6564890 this is an impressive crowd the haves and the have mores
6564891 some people call you the elites i call you my base
6564892 only celebrities like barack obama go to the gym three times a day demand met rx chocolate roasted peanut protein bars and bottles of a hard to find organic brew black forest berry honest tea and worry about the price of arugula

6564896 he has worn a pair of 520 black leather ferragamo shoes on every recent campaign stop from a news conference with the dalai lama to a supermarket visit in bethlehem pa
6564897 the point is that mccain is out of touch with most americans and out of touch with his own finances
6564898 i dont know ill have to check with my staff
6564899 uh err the corperations with their profits global warming change we all can believe in

6564924 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6564925 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6564926 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6564927 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6564928 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board

6564954 the provision of infertility treatment has not been seen as a traditional nhs service and therefore is often viewed as a relatively low priority compared to more visible conditions whose impact is well established
6564955 the groups final report will seek to consider the often unseen consequences of infertility including the impact on mental health and general wellbeing which may draw on other nhs services for treatment as well as the positive benefits of ivf
6564956 lack of knowledge and understanding of infertility and its treatment
6564957 it is appropriate for ivf to be considered carefully for inclusion on the national tariff
6564958 clinicians and practitioners involved in infertility services are all aware that we are not just dealing with a physical pathology

6564966 if i may interject dr d it is difficult to be a woman in a world of men there are certain lines i prefer no to cross
6564967 as a woman if you are not attractive you are at a certain disadvantage i am sure one as attractive as you would not understand but you see for those who do not possess such beauty they tend to cover themselves up with a hard exterior ive met many a successful woman and admired them for their success but not for being a woman i still prefer women to be female
6564968 i dont consider myself beautiful dr d ive always considered myself as charming and i am content with this because beauty fades as time passes but charm grows as the years go by

6564983 u s officials not surprisingly considered the operation one of their greatest foreign policy successes until that is the enormous convulsion that rocked iranian society with the violent ouster of the shah and the installation of a virulently anti american islamic regime in 1979
6564984 in 1953 the united states played a significant role in orchestrating the overthrow of irans popular prime minister mohammed mossadegh the eisenhower administration believed its actions were justified for strategic reasons but the coup was clearly a setback for irans political development and it is easy to see now why many iranians continue to resent this intervention by america in their internal affairs

6565100 the enforcement of federal laws designed to protect their freedom of conscience is long overdue
6565101 this is not just about catholic health care catholics do not stand alone in opposition to the deliberate destruction of nascent human life all health care providers should be free to serve their patients without violating their most deeply held moral and religious convictions on the value of life
6565102 organizations calling themselves pro choice are actually pro coercion in seeking to deny the freedom of doctors and nurses

6565111 we in the chemical industry are in the business of improving lives through innovation and the nebula catalyst development program is a prime example of what is best about our trade these practicing scientists from different organizations have spent years working together and overcoming technical and economic obstacles to bring a unique and important invention not only to life but also to global commercial success their work has helped albemarle and its customers meet the rising global call for cleaner energy solutions
6565112 we are proud of these scientists and of all of our employees who have worked with the nebula catalyst over the years living out our principles of sustainability in our offices labs and manufacturing sites across the globe

6565118 because of the popularity of luxury hotel chains implementing premium hotel bed programs the trend you are seeing now is boutique hotels getting into the hotel bed business by not only offering the beds in their rooms but making them available to consumers as well

6565120 hollandia was the natural choice when selecting a luxury sleep system for our guest rooms and suites
6565121 their innovative designs and sleep systems truly set them apart and compliment westminster hotels signature commitment to providing our guests with the highest level of comfort sophistication and service
6565122 we like the idea that hotel guests can come and try our mattress out for an entire night and then decide whether they want to introduce this kind of quality sleep in their own homes no other retailer can allow their customers such an option
6565123 weve spent a lot of time working on the story this time

6565135 its awesome to get to the final and win it is something i will remember for the rest of my life i think everyone is a little overawed by it
6565136 its been a tremendous journey a tremendous climax for us and a wonderful moment for the boys a once in a lifetime thing
6565137 a couple of weeks ago my son and i looked at the ecb website and saw the story about tunbridge wells winning this competition last year we looked at each other and said are we really going to get there and do what they did its amazing
6565138 i said to our colts chairman in november or december lets get in this competition as i think we can go all the way
6565139 we came to the final with a bit of confidence but not arrogance or complacency we wanted to see how we would do against the top opposition in the country
6565140 i feel very proud of them they controlled both games went out there and seized the initiative and got their punches in first having wolverhampton two for three we were pinching ourselves
6565141 i think its a fantastic competition when you look at the great names of recent english cricket who have played in it trescothick hussain flintoff i wonder if we have anyone in our midst who might one day look back at this as his coming of age

6565145 this study shows just how effective hormone therapy can be in alleviating hot flushes and sleep disturbances and in generally improving other components of quality of life and wellbeing
6565146 taking everything into account latest data shows that hormone therapy in healthy women during the early postmenopausal period is really pretty safe nowadays most specialists working with the menopause consider that the many women who are experiencing a poor quality of life because of the menopause need to be able to decide themselves in consultation with their doctor about taking hrt this study shows the benefits of hrt use and adds even more weight to this conclusion
6565147 this is a significant study which supports our views on hrt it shows that hrt can offer real benefits to most women experiencing menopausal symptoms our advice remains the same each woman is an individual and she needs to discuss whats right for her with her doctor in the light of her medical history this study reinforces the benefits of appropriate use

6565157 the bottom line is that airgun noise from seismic surveys that are thousands of yards distant does not drive away sperm whales living in the gulf
6565158 however some individual whales feeding at depth reduced the rate at which they searched acoustically for their prey when scientists carried out controlled exposure experiments by bringing seismic surveys close by the whales as a result the oil and gas industry has agreed to a best practice attitude that seismic surveys should shut down temporarily when towed airguns come within one third of a mile of whales or groups of whales in the gulf
6565159 sperm whales go to where their food source is and that means very deep water so folks that do see them are marine mammal observers who ride the seismic survey vessels and the workers on the big oil and gas rigs and even that does not happen often
6565160 we now know that the sperm whales in the gulf appear to be their own distinct stock they show genetic and social differences from other sperm whales around the world
6565161 there are believed to be about 500 to 1 500 sperm whales that reside in the gulf

6565170 it is important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order
6565171 its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
6565172 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
6565173 to be very careful and sensitive these days the russians are selling many arms to iran and syria and there is no need to offer them an excuse to sell even more advanced weapons
6565174 both war and peace are in the hands of israeli jews
6565175 gal hirsch who was defeated in lebanon went to georgia and they too lost because of him

6565184 its condominiums where ill have them get to you he said before quitting the campaign trail for three days to strategise with top aides as both the candidates finalise their choice of running mate
6565185 now think about that i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make us5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong he said
6565186 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their house you might have a different perspective
6565187 so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6565188 we cant afford eight more years or four more years or one more year of the same failed economic policies that president george bush has put in place senator obama said
6565189 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6565190 he couldnt count high enough to know how many houses he owns he said on cnn before introducing senator obama in chester by countering republican charges that the relatively inexperienced democrat is too
6565191 to put somebody in the white house who says i dont know much about the economy thats whats risky mr kaine said recapping senator mccains own confession that he knows more about national security than about economic affairs

6565205 im going to support the mccain ticket but i think that would be another discouragement for conservatives so i hope he chooses better than that wiser than that
6565206 barack obama is way far to the left but that would just be i think a political blunder on mccains part and i think the signal to conservatives again is hey we dont need you or where else are you going to go
6565207 hes entitled to his view and i look forward to welcoming him to my wedding in new jersey in 2009 honestly if hed like to be in the wedding party hes more than welcome

6565329 the national football league is deeply saddened by the loss of gene upshaw
6565330 if you look at what hes done and if you really understand the game and know history and do the research of how it was before gene upshaw it was pretty bad he built on it every year you have strikes and maybe people that have been upset with him in recent years about retired players and how they were being treated but for us players in the game today you have to respect him and understand how much he meant to the game
6565331 his service as executive director of the nflpa is a stamp that all of us are proud of
6565332 he certainly has been a rock for us from a players standpoint and we are deeply saddened about his passing our hearts go out to his family first and to his former teammates friends and co workers
6565333 i got to know gene through my years of being a player rep i cant stand here and say i knew him extremely well personally but having worked with him i know that he is a man that was very well respected for a lot of reasons certainly for his 15 year career with the oakland raiders where he won two super bowls and went to the pro bowl seven times that record speaks for itself and certainly what hes done for the p a and the players now i know there have been a lot of complaints with some disgruntled players with some of the things but i think those are all things that have to do with personal issues when you look at the facts at what gene upshaw did for this organization its pretty awesome

6565448 in three days 9 people died and 17 were injured in traffic accidents in phnom penh
6565449 to clarify ones position by kneeling down under the pressure of the diplomatic politics by siam thailand or to say that the hun sen government is defeated by the siamese thai diplomatic warfare regarding the incursion by siamese troops to control the preah vihear temple and the ta moan temple regions these are two prominent positions to describe the representatives of the hun sen government
6565450 this information was made known after a two day meeting on 18 and 19 august 2008 and especially after a high ranking delegation of the government of cambodia led by the minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation hor namhong accompanied by senior representatives of the minister of interior of cambodia also came to visit the siamese king at his palace in hua hin
6565451 explaining that this is to express sympathy and friendship among good neighbors between cambodia and thailand and to avoid confrontation between siamese troops invading and khmer troops protecting its territory hor namhong and the siamese minister of foreign affairs tej bunnang reported the same content about the results of these negotiations
6565452 moreover hor namhong said also that in response to an order by hun sen cambodia agreed on its side to please siam by promising to recall the khmer troops from the preah vihear temple region of cambodia
6565453 hor namhong said we will withdraw all troops from the contested regions we will withdraw also the complaint to the un security council
6565454 cambodia filed a complaint to the un security council to ask for intervention asking to convene an urgent meeting to solve the confrontation between cambodian and siamese troops after siam had invaded khmer territory on 15 july 2008
6565455 1 the kingdom of thailand supports the inscription of the temple of preah vihear on the world heritage list proposed by the kingdom of cambodia the perimeter of which is identified as n 1 in the map prepared by the cambodian authorities and herewith attached 2 the kingdom of cambodia accepts that the temple of preah vihear be nominated for inscription on the world heritage list without at this stage a buffer zone on the northern and western areas of the temple
6565456 mr hor namhong said also we will withdraw the troops unilaterally form the disputed regions to express the good will of cambodia to avoid a confrontation that might lead to armed conflict
6565457 what is seen is that siam has a landslide victory in its diplomatic warfare hiding its military incursion into cambodia when the head diplomat hor namhong on hun sens order agreed to do everything by kneeling down to totally beg siam like through the promise to revoke the complaint against siam to the un security council and to announce to withdraw the khmer troops from khmer territory first so that siam agrees to withdraw its invading troops also
6565458 observers and experts officials said that the hun sen government made cambodia to be a looser because that territory belongs to cambodia as stated in the verdict of the international court of justice in the hague in 1962
6565459 getting out from the khmer siamese foreign affairs ministerial meeting on 18 august 2008 in hua hin and then visiting the siamese king hor namhong said that the khmer and the siamese sides agreed to leave only ten soldiers at the keo sekha kiri svarak pagoda and twenty soldiers close to the pagoda in order to lessen the confrontation by both sides
6565460 furthermore the head of the khmer diplomats hor namhong said that as a concession which is quick like an arrow aiming to defuse the confrontation between the troops of both sides that the government of cambodia agreed to withdraw all its troops from the border and will turn to negotiate peacefully through meetings between the border commissions of both countries
6565461 in the meantime regarding about the movement of troops by siam into the ta moan temple on khmer territory in the western dang rek mountain region it was kept as a separate issue
6565462 this shows that it is a strategic trick of siam in the diplomatic field to create new problems while cambodia is weak in this field as well as in the field to defend the nation
6565463 both sides claim that the solution for the disputes at the preah vihear temple is to plan to look for border markers to clearly mark the border lines
6565464 just having seen that the hun sen government agreed to kneel down to beg siam with promises that cambodia will withdraw its troops even from the preah vihear temple of cambodia to please siam so that they withdraw their troops from the areas where they invaded cambodia allows everyone to knows that the hun sen government is very weak diplomacy as well as militarily to defend its territorial integrity how can khmers then hope that cambodia ruled by the hun sen government of the cambodian peoples party will not lose cambodian territory because they serve the interests of themselves or of factions among the leaders of siam and of the hun sen government

6565474 all of us are creatures of habit and when things are going well you just buy what you bought last week

6565476 just because its a store brand doesnt mean its not the best for your family

6565488 for instance theyre working with him on throwing a four seam fastball up and out of the strike zone to a left handed hitter once in a while because hes a sinker baller thats got value

6565518 i did feel for a long period that there wasnt anything new to buy
6565519 but i really like the slim fit its not so roomy not so bulky and its a lot cleaner
6565520 this is a trend that you have to buy otherwise you look outdated
6565521 suddenly a pair of cargo pants and a polo shirt doesnt look good anymore
6565522 womens wear has painted themselves in a corner by offering too many options and with everything a trend it is very easy not to buy anything
6565523 if you are keeping up with fashion people notice and it gives them more confidence
6565524 i had looked in the mirror and never was impressed i looked like a little kid who was waiting to grow into his clothes
6565525 i feel extremely confident in the way i look everyone has noticed
6565526 thanks im still sore from the surgeries but ready to get back to teaching
6565527 hey before you go to your classroom dr mae wants to see you
6565528 good morning sit here while i call oliver i want him in on this meeting
6565529 sandi the sub we got for you is going to be teaching the rest of your semester
6565530 okay thats okay because i have one more surgery to go what will i be doing
6565531 yes i bring in my own things as teaching tools thats the room we use for class meetings and student teaching
6565532 i want you to separate your personal possessions from the child development possessions and take them home
6565533 all classrooms are going to look the same there will be no more kid stuff on the walls no more toys in the classroom i will find area preschools to donate the toys to the painting trade will paint over the murals the child development classroom is going to look like a college classroom
6565534 i use those toys for hands on teaching students utilize them in teaching in the classroom and at practicum they are part of the curriculum i painted those murals they are the cover art from picture books used in those preschool practicums did you recognize where the wild things are the napping house or going on a bear hunt
6565535 you are not allowed to interrupt the learning that is going on in that class
6565536 when you left for your surgery you left the curriculum in such a mess
6565537 what are you talking about the semester was completed i ordered manuals for the next class and set up binders for the students enrolled i updated my sub folder
6565538 only three students failed they didnt take the lesson planning and implementation components seriously they didnt do them i attached an explanation to their exit records anyway those arent requirements that you mark off in a lecture class theyre practical applications that have to be done at preschools with children
6565539 you sabotaged the success of our students with the employer specific section of the child development training achievement record you modified a government document you cant do that
6565540 i didnt modify the department of labor portion of the training achievement record were allowed to add to the employer specific section
6565541 what is the purpose of the employer specific section then
6565542 you can add three or four things you had three pages that insured that our students failed
6565543 those three pages include weekly updates for the two 3 unit courses i teach that articulate to the community college they also include practicum skills proof of fingerprinting and the food handlers test all those skills are required for child development students before they can be hired those are state requirements
6565544 those units are secondary to the training achievement record i cut them from the child development curriculum
6565545 what you are sabotaging the students they cant get a job without those requirements
6565546 im not going to order the manuals theyre too expensive
6565547 i did research and ordered the book required by department of labor the students are going to use it
6565548 dr mae i was the person who went to washington dc to write the child development training achievement record i was the one who requested the required books to go with it the book you ordered might cover the training achievement record requirements but it wont cover the college courses thats what the manuals are for
6565549 well it looks like im on my way out of here arent i
6565550 i dont think so as a matter of fact i know youre not we are going to open up the classroom to evening classes thats why you cant have anything personal in the classroom
6565551 a second child development class will be opening in september you might be teaching it or maybe an evening class
6565552 okaaay what will i be doing after i finish sorting out my personal stuff from the child development stuff that should only take a week or so its thirteen weeks before the september class
6565553 hello just a minute i have people in my office

6565667 i met one alex jackinson who was gringomans putative publisher in santo domingo back in 90 jackinson was about 90 himself then and he was there attending a conference of latin political writers to which i was a speaker

6565718 wir haben heute abend keine silbermedaille gewonnen wir haben die goldmedaille verloren
6565719 die usa hatten nur diese eine m glichkeit in einem spiel das wir weitestgehend dominiert haben allerdings muss man im fussball die chancen verwerten die sich einem bieten das haben wir nicht getan die amerikanerinnen haben genau das getan und am ende unverdient gewonnen
6565720 wir sind mit viel selbstvertrauen in die partie gegangen vor allem aufgrund der qualit t die wir in den vorangegangenen spielen gezeigt haben wir haben fest daran geglaubt dass wir am ende die goldmedaille erringen w rden die wir so dringend brauchten um zu hause nderungen herbeizuf hren durchschlagende nderungen erreicht man mit einem gro en erfolg und wir haben es nicht geschafft
6565721 wir wissen noch nicht genau wie es mit dem brasilianischen fussball weitergeht einige dieser spielerinnen werden sich aus altersgr nden aus der nationalmannschaft verabschieden also m ssen wir ad quaten ersatz finden und es wird wohl zu einem umbruch kommen ich werde mich mit den verantwortlichen des brasilianischen fussballverbands zusammensetzen um die situation zu analysieren heute kann ich noch nicht wirklich sagen was passieren wird
6565722 we won the gold medal and no one even knows half our names
6565723 i mean im still kind of in shock right now
6565724 never in my wildest dreams would i have thought that id score the goal to get us the olympic gold
6565725 its something you see in hollywood and in these fairy tales and yet it was really playing out
6565726 this was too perfect i cant really swallow it right now
6565727 there is nothing in the clay the workers are using
6565728 usually archeologists find it difficult to get rid of debris soil but in our case this soil is used productively
6565729 normally such sites should be encircled with 100 or 150 meters of carefully guarded territory however for unknown reasons such minguruk is not guarded in a proper way
6565730 vindicated i feel great i feel amazing i just won a gold medal
6565731 it was hard and this win wasnt just down to my goal
6565732 it was only achievable with the team we have and that we played for each other
6565733 but i feel stronger in the end i know it sounds crazy but im glad i went though it i learned a lot about myself
6565734 i asked two questions do you want to win yes do you need goalkeepers to win yes
6565735 we had to move on and this day you could see that we did it
6565736 this is such a reward for nine months of hard hard work and soul searching after the world cup
6565737 i have no idea why we cant win a final
6565738 its something im going to keep asking myself for a long time you keep asking what you did wrong
6565739 again we had a chance to win the gold and again we let it slip away its hard to say why that keeps happening to us
6565740 we are not looking at the results but on how we play
6565741 soccer is not a matter of 1 0 or 2 0 its the way to find out the rhythm the match against norway is our key point in the tournament we found out our weak points and improved it thats why we stand here with the gold medal
6565742 i think i was leaning to my left waiting to dive to the left because the whole goal was open
6565743 and she ended up going right and i luckily kept some of my weight on the right
6565744 i dont understand why the ball wouldnt go in in so many games before we were able to score easily but today it wasnt the case
6565745 i just knew that i had to keep it low strike it hard and it went in
6565746 we said dont worry about making mistakes just go out there and play with confidence and be brave you could feel it every minute of that second half and in overtime we felt strong
6565747 its been great to see jamaica get a clean sweep of the sprints
6565748 that would be more in the spirit of the olympic ideal
6565749 common sense would dictate that it looks likely to be a formality to disqualify her
6565750 it teaches you to be patient when you are lying in a hospital bed and that was almost the same strategy i chose here to wait for my chance in the pack

6565756 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6565757 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
6565758 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
6565759 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul

6565762 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
6565763 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6565764 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6565765 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6565766 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6565767 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6565768 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6565769 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6565770 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6565771 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6565772 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

6565774 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
6565775 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
6565776 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6565777 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6565778 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6565779 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
6565780 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
6565781 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
6565782 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6565783 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
6565784 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you

6565786 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
6565787 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30

6565827 about ckd completely knocked down units assembly of a number of commercial vehicle models
6565828 models that would be introduced in southeast asia by 2013 are already being talked about now because such projects take some five years
6565829 the plans of other automotive giants would not be so different
6565830 efforts of the association of southeast asian nations to put up an asean economic community by 2015

6565835 what is the credibitiy of the library in promoting the 3rd ovid advanced search version in less than a year over the relatively consistent pubmed interface
6565836 the tip box was created for advertising commercials to recover the cost of all these unnecessary changes
6565837 vermeld was de respons nogal uiteenlopend wat de een vervelend vond vond de andere wel best ik ben met danielle benieuwd hoe men tegen de huidige veranderingen aankijkt zullen de mensen die klaagden over de nieuwe interface nu wel tevreden zijn en de mensen die het allemaal juist prima vonden of diegenen wier grootste frustatie het steeds weer wennen aan de nieuwe interface was een informatiespecialist verzuchtte hoe je als bibliotheek nog geloofwaardig kunt zijn als je in minder dan een jaar 3x een nieuwe ovid advanced search moet promoten terwijl pubmed redelijk hetzelfde blijft
6565838 what we have accomplished in this agreement is the most advanced version of any
6565839 because the u s negotiators indeed showed a great deal of flexibility and understanding
6565840 we recognize that the government still has to review this agreement and well await that process and then it obviously has to go to the council of representatives
6565841 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6565842 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6565843 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6565844 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6565845 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6565846 considering the current retail environment we are pleased with our results for the quarter
6565847 performance footwear and apparel were key to our sales growth while we are aware that the economic stimulus package aided our results in the second quarter we also believe that our systems investments from a year ago are beginning to positively impact our sales
6565848 our performance in the quarter was driven by strong revenue growth in our two largest segments

6565851 i felt a glimmer of hope when i heard this bill had went through we are 2 months behind on our
6565852 very interesting article and interview i agree that the bill is great for white house publicity
6565853 although our earnings for the second quarter were in line with our expectations our results continue to reflect the impact of a weakening economy on the retail sector
6565854 thank you again for your process and for your time i hope that everyone i send your way buys your program and that they receive the same benefits and knowledge that i have received from it
6565855 mr robert blake thank you for publishing the e mail virus explination on your website i received

6565859 allowed itself to be hijacked by highly partisan ideologically driven staff
6565860 this combined with wmcs wealth and undeniable political influence and effectiveness has made wmc the single biggest driver of our toxic political environment and thus the single biggest obstacle to the recovery of wisconsins economy
6565861 the macro environment remains challenging and retailers are becoming increasingly promotional
6565862 therefore we believe it is prudent to adopt a more conservative outlook for the back half of the year

6565875 i was wondering how you approached dwight differently from mackenzie crooks gareth
6565876 do you really want to ask questions from five years ago
6565877 that happened in 2004 which i guess is four years ago
6565878 and dwights just so much more aggressive that gareth and it put me off at first and then i appreciated how brilliant it was
6565879 i didnt really formulate him as aggressive i just think that americans are a lot more direct than english people you create a character partially in terms of the needs of the show and its how hes written you know its not like dwight is written as a more passive fainting flower they needed a real obstacle for the other people in the office right off the bat and dwight had to be that obstacle it had to be dwight vs the office on health care thats the third episode we did he had to be the nemesis in a different way than gareth was
6565880 the way i thought of it was that dwight is so terrified of this hes really nervous in front of large groups of people hes ready to absolutely tank the speech that dwight probably wrote up for himself was probably the worst speech possible what jim did was give him the perfect vehicle to express himself the phrases of mao and mussolini and all of sudden it just clicked and all of that tension and nervousness poured through that alleyway of fascism it was like mt vesuvius erupting

6565893 but by the same token we know these very same people are not interested in less religiosity in the political discourse they almost universally want a religious person as president
6565894 its not that they want to take religion out of politics its that their frustrations with the way things seem to be going are leading them to say well maybe churches should back off on this

6565910 when the ipv4 supply runs out youre going to have to pay to get addresses and after another ten years the price is going be amazing
6565911 you havent done anything with ipv6 and now its way too late
6565912 it was all meant to be finished now but we havent started
6565913 theres no ipv6 out there in production land and no ipv4 addresses left if you want ipv6 to happen now some external factor is going to have to kick you in the pants
6565914 when addressing gets really expensive its not obvious that youll jump to ipv6 its more likely that youll nat very intensively
6565915 because while ipv6 might be technically whiz bang it represents the benefit of a minor technology upgrade at the cost of a major forklift upgrade

6565920 recently the minnesota national guard informed us that nearly 400 soldiers who had enrolled in school last year had not received the educational benefits they were promised
6565921 i am grateful that secretary of veterans affairs james peake expeditiously granted relief to each member of the national guard affected by this situation

6565984 voi face trei patru schimb ri n echip asta e clar
6565985 meciul rapid dinamo este considerat unul cu grad de risc maxim vor fi prezen i n giule ti circa 350 de jandarmi poate i mai mul i iar ace tia vor interveni n for numai dac stewarzii nu vor face fa la eventuale incidente jandarmii nu vor fi la vedere pentru c dup acea lege mitic s a considerat c uniformele i irit pe suporteri
6565986 vom lua toate m surile pentru a evita incidente la meci
6565987 controlul va fi unul la s nge nimeni nu va avea acces cu brichete ori chei
6565988 nu sunt de acord cu rota ia cadrelor p n la urm antrenorul decide dar dac ar fi dup mine cred c ar trebui s joace cel mai n form nu s se fac modific ri n primul 11 doar de dragul de a juca i al ii
6565989 ei au o echip bun cu juc tori valoro i care au venit acum dar noi mergem s c tig m n giule ti
6565990 dac seria rezultatelor negative va continua vor avea de suferit at t antrenorii c t i juc torii prefer ns s nu discut deocamdat despre astfel de variante cert este c nu ne am g ndit la demiteri ionu popa are n continuare sprijinul nostru i cred c poate redresa echipa
6565991 regulamentul de ordine interioar prevede c echipa are primele blocate dac se afl pe locuri retrogradabile astfel c n eventualitatea unei victorii cu farul juc torii nu vor ncasa niciun ban
6565992 am pierdut puncte importante din cauza gre elilor copil re ti pe care le am f cut n ap rare sper ca b ie ii s fie aten i de acum ncolo i s trateze cu maxim concentrare toate fazele pe toat durata partidei n ciuda faptului c nu avem niciun punct sunt convins c putem ncepe ascensiunea s mb t dac batem farul
6565993 dac p n acum am avut scuze c am nt lnit pe teren propriu steaua i fc vaslui dou forma ii cu preten ii la titlu i care ne reprezint n cupele europene acum vom evolua n compania farului un adversar care ne este la ndem n avem nevoie obligatoriu de cele trei puncte i sunt convins c le vom ob ine
6565994 n acest sezon biletele vor costa 10 lei la peluze i 20 de lei la tribunele a i b ns la partidele cu adversari importan i gen rapid cfr cluj sau dinamo biletele vor fi ceva mai scumpe exact cum s a nt mplat i la meciul cu steaua n ciuda scumpirii sunt convins c suporterii adev ra i vor fi n continuare al turi de noi
6565995 la meciul cu dinamo doar cei trei portughezi i tudose au vrut s joace restul se f ceau c nu n eleg indica iile l vor napoi pe stoica dar el e vinovat de situa ia actual am cheltuit o gr mad de bani cu cantonamentele i cu juc torii ceru i de el i ce a f cut echipa a fost nepreg tit at t din punct de vedere fizic c t i psihic am preferat s renun la fotbali tii care nu mai voiau s joace pentru echip sunt convins c la meciul cu timi oara va fi un alt nceput

6566072 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6566073 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6566074 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6566075 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this

6566080 younger women arrive at a new office pumped up on suze orman and you go girl self empowerment and are quickly deflated by the necessary drudgery of copying and collating older women who have paid their dues dealing with sexism and grunt work for decades are chagrined that younger women assume they can just show up and take over commence an intergenerational clash
6566081 dear manager id love it if you gave me something anything to help me learn so i can become a better more profitable employee to you

6566087 a moreno y guerra los hemos seguido desde hace un buen tiempo nos preocupaban cosas m s all de lo futbol stico como si podr an encajar bien en el grupo y el esp ritu que iban a demostrar son dos jugadores del sector de ataque que pueden contribuir mucho al equipo
6566088 vamos a enfrentar a selecciones con jugadores muy desequilibrantes y tenemos que partir de una primicia que es el orden y quitarles la pelota ante siria nos hab amos puesto la meta de no recibir goles pero con tantos cambios se desajust el orden defensivo
6566089 ha sido uno de los buenos partidos que ha realizado colombia en todos los sentidos s lo falt el gol pero me gust mucho la prueba que hicimos de varios comportamientos t cticos atacar presionar quitarle la pelota al contrario adelantar l neas y tener seguridad defensiva
6566090 botamos el penal sumado a que no concretamos algunas opciones y eso nos dej disgustados
6566091 realizamos un manejo de espacio reducido diferente que nos permiti hacer cosas muy importantes si esa actitud y din mica se mantienen va a ser muy bueno para el equipo infortunadamente no evidenciamos la anterior con los goles pero el criterio que se tuvo fue muy diferente y eso es importante tenerlo presente
6566092 esta medalla es de ustedes as que g cenla gracias por el apoyo
6566093 este es el cari o el reconocimiento del pueblo por tu tenacidad por tu esfuerzo
6566094 vamos a honrar tu gran haza a y vamos a declarar a la ciudad deportiva irving saladino
6566095 viva irving saladino me siento orgulloso de haberlo recibido como un h roe

6566100 salta alto salta cruel salta duro para eso cristina y david sus padres te hicieron un canguro
6566101 realmente no jugamos bien s lo puedo estar satisfecho con el resultado yo esperaba que pudi ramos controlar mejor el juego
6566102 tenemos que jugar con el estilo holand s tomando la iniciativa cuando sea posible y manteniendo la posesi n cuando las cosas sean m s complicadas e hicimos eso perfectamente
6566103 todos estamos muy contentos con este xito dalia luch para conseguir esa medalla y se lo merece porque es una muchacha muy disciplinada creo que en ese punto est la clave de su xito
6566104 creo que nuestro xito se debe a la implementaci n de un sistema de preparaci n adaptado a la realidad venezolana es decir no es una copia de otro pa s sino que se basa en las posibilidades que hay en venezuela
6566105 el solo hecho de estar entre los 16 mejores representantes del mundo en este deporte es un xito pero lograr que traigan una medalla al pa s en tan dif cil evento es un valor agregado
6566106 los muchachos est n concentrados pero la idea no es presionarlos yo s que cada uno de ellos va a dar lo mejor de s en estos ol mpicos en donde cada combate representa una final por la calidad existente en la contienda
6566107 there is little time left to get a solid negotiating text on the table clearly the clock is ticking
6566108 people in a burning house cannot afford to lose time in an argument
6566109 we have to speed up the pace the negotiations here in accra must deliver concrete results
6566110 governments need to focus on reducing emissions caused by deforestation and forest degradation
6566111 progress on substance must be swifter the level of ambition by both developed and developing countries higher and the measures to reduce co2 carbon dioxide emissions stronger
6566112 you shall know the truth and the truth will set you free
6566113 when i think about veritas i think about warning and hope
6566114 warning and hope are the two elements found in the seven letters to the seven churches in the book of revelation
6566115 even healthy people should see a doctor once a year to hear the truth about their health
6566116 we wanted to produce a large number of disease models for ourselves our collaborators and the stem cell research community to accelerate research
6566117 the original embryonic stem cell lines are generic and allow you to ask only basic questions but these new lines are valuable tools for attacking the root causes of disease our work is just the beginning for studying thousands of diseases in a petri dish
6566118 the suite of ips cell lines reported by the daley group marks an important achievement and a very significant advance for patients suffering from degenerative diseases
6566119 these disease specific ips cells are invaluable tools that will allow researchers to watch the development of diseases in petri dishes outside of the patients
6566120 this report will be seen as opening the door to a new approach to develop therapies
6566121 one of our goals in creating the nih directors pioneer and new innovator award programs was to enable exceptionally creative scientists to move quickly in promising new directions thereby speeding the intellectual and technical breakthroughs needed to address major challenges in biomedical or behavioral research
6566122 this is certainly the case for drs daley and hochedlinger who deployed their directors award resources to advance our ability to use induced pluripotent stem cells for disease specific studies and drug development
6566123 the cell lines available from the ips core will allow stem cell researchers around the world to explore possible gene therapies for some conditions and will aid in the development of drugs for others
6566124 once you have the volume mounted for the first time you can format it with any file system you want or if you have advanced applications such as high end database engines you could use it directly
6566125 we see developers using this feature for long term backup purposes for use in rollback strategies for worldwide volume re creation purposes
6566126 snapshots also play an important role in building fault tolerance scenarios when combined with managing applications using elastic ip addresses and availability zones
6566127 one of the criticisms of ec2 when it first launched was the inability to run a fast data store across snapshots which made running databases or other data intensive applications slightly more complicated
6566128 the difference between ebs and s3 is that ebs allows block level access so that it can be mounted just like any other local storage device from within ec2 and can be accessed across servers and between instances

6566140 himalayan glaciers are retreating more rapidly than anywhere else in the world
6566141 the glaciers retreat is enormous up to 70 metres 230 feet per year
6566142 snow and glacial ice melting provide a very important source for fresh water for irrigation energy and drinking water downstream
6566143 the drier areas are becoming drier while the wetter areas are becoming wetter
6566144 in the past the rivers had a fairly constant flow throughout the summer due to melt water now you have a lot of rain in the spring and then you have fairly dry conditions throughout the rest of the summer
6566145 maybe before your district was suffering from one flash flood every season and that was perhaps what people managed to cope with but if you get three or four or five flash floods maybe thats too much the question is how much more can people tolerate without losing their basis for livelihood
6566146 this will transform the carbon sink into a carbon source more soil carbon will be released with the melting of glaciers and permafrost

6566160 it is extraordinarily disappointing that after our board unequivocally rejected costar
6566161 your board of directors after significant analysis has approved a plan of liquidation which we believe will most likely maximize stockholder value since the companys public trading volume is very low approximately 4 000 shares per day there is no significant current market liquidity for our stockholders with the adoption and implementation of this plan significant cash could be distributed the initial distribution could range between 78 million and 91 million and our total distributions could range between 116 million and 133 million

6566184 die heeft iedereen die zo tien kilometer zwemt maar dat je dit zes jaar na zon behandeling kunt hij bezorgt zijn medepati nten met deze ziekte een geweldige opsteker
6566185 nou ja de leukemie zelf hoeft geen belemmering meer te zijn maar hij moet bijzonder weinig schade aan de chemo hebben overgehouden dat gif tast vooral de organen aan natuurlijk pati nten reageren verschillend op de behandeling
6566186 maar voor deze prestatie moet je meer dan honderd procent hebben maarten van der weijden bewijst dat je blijkbaar toch zo uit die loodzware behandeling kan komen hij behoort echt tot de gelukkigen ik heb ook velen horen verzuchten dat ze jaren ouder waren geworden
6566187 dat wordt vaker gezegd maar nogal wat pati nten gaan juist met de dag leven en wensen vooral geen grootse plannen te maken dat er helemaal voor gaan na je genezing dat is een beetje boekenwijsheid
6566188 wat doet dat daarna met je zoek je dan toch eerder naar dat gevoel van ik kan het nog ik heb jonge mensen blijvend gebukt zien gaan onder deze ellende en anderen er blijmoedig uit zien opklauteren maarten moet het zelf nog maar eens zeggen
6566189 indrukwekkend is het wel maar ook eerder vertoond lance armstrong kwam terug van teelbalkanker en zware chemokuren kinderen van zes zeven jaar kunnen hoge doseringen doorstaan en herstellen deze sporters waren ouder maar redden dat ook na hevige vermoeidheid in het begin natuurlijk
6566190 ze was veel beter geweest als kandidaat voor het witte huis dan obama hillary is een knokker en ze heeft in het witte huis gezeten ze weet wat het is om amerika te leiden
6566191 elke presidentskandidaat heeft het recht zelf iemand te kiezen met wie hij denkt te kunnen werken ik laat mijn stem niet afhangen van wie de vicepresidentskandidaat is
6566192 wat me dwarszit bij obama is bijvoorbeeld dat hij weigerde een speldje met de amerikaanse vlag op zijn revers te dragen hij deed daar geringschattend over terwijl het een teken van patriottisme is
6566193 alleen omdat ik democraat ben en omdat er snel een einde aan de irak oorlog moet komen
6566194 ik hou van die man hij is een echte held hij heeft als krijgsgevangene geleden voor amerika
6566195 ik had er echt de pest in toen clinton verloor
6566196 ik ben bang dat hij een nieuwe oorlog begint tegen iran
6566197 mccain is zo oud maar in elk geval zal hij de militairen steunen obama praat mooi maar ik geloof hem niet
6566198 het zou mooi geweest zijn als we een vrouw in het witte huis hadden gekregen maar zaken die vrouwen belangrijk vinden zijn bij obama ook in goede handen hij heeft een sterke vrouw michelle zal hem bij de les houden
6566199 gefeliciteerd jongens jullie hebben je eerste les in het voortgezet onderwijs erop zitten

6566203 maar toen we leerlingen moesten werven hadden we dit gebouw nog niet en konden we dus ook niets laten zien
6566204 het is heel gezellig hier de kinderen zijn heel aardig
6566205 ik geloof gewoon heel erg en hier zitten kinderen die dat begrijpen
6566206 de amazone is een immens gebied van zeven miljoen vierkante kilometer zo groot als europa zonder rusland viervijfde deel daarvan staat nog altijd overeind maar er wordt inderdaad veel gekapt sinds 2000 gaat er alleen al in brazili elk jaar de helft van nederland aan bos tegen de vlakte om die kap tegen te gaan moet er iets gebeuren
6566207 nooit een hek mensen moeten de natuur in kunnen je moet twee dingen doen je moet zon twintig procent strikt beschermen tegen elke vorm van moderne economische activiteit en de bosgebieden eromheen moet je duurzaam beheren die bufferzones kunnen vele bosproducten opleveren waarvan mensen die er wonen kunnen leven alleen al in het braziliaanse amazonewoud wonen 26 miljoen mensen en die hebben recht op een inkomen en een goed bestaan
6566208 export van amazoneproducten levert nu al banen en inkomsten op voor duizenden mensen maar dat kunnen er veel meer worden het zijn consumentenproducten die voldoen aan internationale kwaliteitseisen sla mijn boek amazon your business er maar op na het is de eerste gids voor duurzame regenwoudproducten uit alle amazonelanden met zulke producten kunnen ondernemers goede zaken doen geld verdienen en tegelijkertijd de regenwouden in de amazone helpen behouden en mensen daar een inkomen bezorgen daar kun je mee thuis komen
6566209 ondernemers vertellen me dat ze het een mooi boek vinden waar ze vrolijk van worden ik schreef het in het engels en liet het vertalen in het nederlands portugees en spaans deze week kwam de eerste bestelling uit noorwegen binnen het 48ste land waar mijn boek naartoe ging in september verschijnt de tweede engelse druk laatst mocht ik het op de vn biodiversiteitsconferentie in bonn presenteren aan de bekende amerikaanse econoom jeffrey sachs het belangrijkste is dat al minimaal acht ondernemers in europa en de verenigde staten zaken doen of gaan doen met de producenten in het boek
6566210 energiedrankjes cosmetica voedingssupplementen rubberen tassen geneesmiddelen paranoten gouden sieraden schoenen van krokodillenleer
6566211 door de krokodillenjacht dreigden zeldzame kaaimansoorten uit te sterven daarom heeft bolivia in 1990 de handel in kaaimanproducten verboden maar in 1996 heeft bolivia het biotrade programma van de unctad ge ntroduceerd onder bepaalde voorwaarden wordt handel in producten van krokodillenleer weer toegestaan
6566212 dat betekent werk voor honderden inheemse kaaimanfokkers jagers en leerlooiers dankzij de leerproductie neemt de stroperij van wilde kaaimannen af zo gaat armoedebestrijding hand en hand met natuurbescherming bolivia exporteert voor meer dan een miljoen dollar per jaar aan tassen schoenen riemen en portemonnees van krokodillenleer en ook nog voor zon 400 duizend dollar aan krokodillenvlees
6566213 in colombia is een project waar al het kwik wordt opgevangen het komt niet in het milieu dat groene goud heeft zijn weg naar europese en amerikaanse juweliers al gevonden die kunnen zich ermee onderscheiden internationale financi le instellingen tonen er belangstelling voor ik overleg nu met natuur en ontwikkelingsorganisaties en commerci le partijen over schone goudwinning in suriname veel regenwoud daar is nog in tact maar kwik is de grootste bedreiging
6566214 als je te weinig noten laat liggen is dat inderdaad niet duurzaam je kunt delen van een bosconcessie afwisselend voor notenrapers openstellen en sluiten in de boliviaanse hoofdstad la paz verwerken ze met negentiende eeuwse machines uit duitsland paranoten in chocola van wilde cacaobonen het heet rainforest delight heerlijk is dat bootjes van de fabriek kopen noten in rivierdorpen
6566215 daar leven nu zon vierhonderd verzamelaars van wilde cacaobonen en paranoten voordat die mensen daarmee bezig waren jaagden ze op wild dankzij de chocoladefabriek stoppen ze daarmee de boliviaanse chocola van wilde cacao heeft een zwitserse prijs gewonnen die chocola staat zo goed bekend dat de vraag ernaar de plaatselijke cacaoprijs al met vijftig procent heeft opgestuwd zo krijgt het regenwoud economische waarde precies wat je moet hebben
6566216 je moet de productie controleren daarvoor hebben we een beproefd uitgangspunt het fsc keurmerk voor hout dat kan op andere bosproducten worden toegepast het keurmerk eist traceerbaarheid van producten tot aan de plek waar ze vandaan komen als de nederlandse regering de traceerbaarheid van grondstoffen naar de bron zou verplichten kan de invoer van illegaal hout worden belemmerd wegen zijn inderdaad een dilemma daarom moeten ook grote stukken bos helemaal beschermd worden
6566217 dat is zeker een risico maar is dat een reden om bij voorbaat af te zien van duurzame exploitatie nee want dan wordt het amazonewoud botweg gekapt honderden miljoenen mensen zijn afhankelijk van de natuur indirect is iedereen er afhankelijk van ook wij in het noorden daarom zouden we niet alleen moeten betalen voor natuurproducten maar ook voor diensten uit de natuur zoals schoon water schone lucht co2 opslag en biodiversiteit ergens in midden amerika betaalt een benedenstrooms gelegen dorp geld aan de mensen die boven het bos instand houden waaruit een rivier naar beneden stroomt die mensen peinzen er niet over het bos te kappen
6566218 ik interviewde de voormalige braziliaanse milieuminister marina silva en zij verzekerde me dat er geen regenwoud gekapt wordt voor biobrandstof maar in brazili maken sojaplantages plaats voor suikerriet voor bio ethanol vervolgens wordt regenwoud gekapt voor sojaplantages de teelt van brandstofgewassen is een levensgrote bedreiging voor het bos en daarmee voor de landbouw want kap van het regenwoud kan leiden tot het uitblijven van regen
6566219 het grote amerika tegen de nietige antillen dat gevoel heerst bij ons op de eilanden
6566220 op een wat overdreven manier hebben wij proberen aan te tonen dat er ook mensen zijn die er niet aan moeten denken om ouder te zijn
6566221 ouders mogen voor een ziek kind meteen weg toen mijn hond gesteriliseerd moest worden mocht mijn partner een vrije dag opnemen geef ons ook eens een ochtend vrij zodat we onze bejaarde moeder kunnen bezoeken
6566222 wij hebben dit onderzoek laten verrichten om meer begrip tussen ouders en kinderlozen te kweken maar op onze website is inmiddels een keiharde confrontatie gaande tussen de twee groepen het is wel duidelijk dat kinderlozen weigeren nog langer een zwijgende massa te zijn
6566223 mogen wij nu ook eens aan het woord komen ouders doen dat al eeuwen we zien homos graag uit de kast komen juichen hun vrijheid toe laat de maatschappij nu eens met eenzelfde vreugde de kinderlozen begroeten en hun levenshouding serieus nemen
6566224 ik hoorde ook over iemand die bezig is een kindvrij wooncomplex te bouwen

6566226 hoge prijzen het best zijn te bestrijden met hoge prijzen
6566227 sommige huizen worden daar mede door de kredietcrisis tegen stunttarieven aangeboden net zoals in de vs
6566228 op lange termijn kan zon aankoop een goede investering zijn
6566229 de huizen in deze regio zijn veel te hoog geprijsd in werkelijkheid ligt de waarde van de huizen zon 20 procent lager maar je moet als huizenkoper zeer goed zijn ge nformeerd om het huis voor de actuele waarde in handen te krijgen
6566230 huizen in spanje zijn over het algemeen familiebezit ze gaan van generatie op generatie het maakt spanjaarden niet veel uit of het huis wel of niet verkocht wordt omdat ze geen lening bij de bank hebben uitstaan

6566243 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four
6566244 if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6566245 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans

6566253 meiden kunnen ontzettend venijnig zijn de vorming van kliekjes kan daardoor goed uit de hand lopen
6566254 e n meisje neemt het voortouw zij is mooi goed gebekt een echte leidster om haar heen schaart zich onmiddellijk een aantal meiden want je wilt maar wat graag bij het populaire groepje horen
6566255 maar vaak start er daarna een machtsspel het populaire type bepaalt wat er gebeurt ze merkt dat de andere meisjes veel doen om er maar bij te mogen horen en dan begint het manipuleren roddelen buitensluiten pesten
6566256 scholen gaan er dit jaar voor het eerst mee aan de slag dit onderwerp is duidelijk hot het leeft enorm dat merken we wel aan de belangstelling
6566257 het is een fictief verhaal maar van deskundigen en docenten die het gelezen hebben krijg ik te horen dit is precies wat meidenvenijn is zo gebeurt het
6566258 het moest ook een spannend kinderboek worden dus het is extra dramatisch neergezet zeker de ontknoping
6566259 ik hoop dat meisjes door dit te lezen inzicht krijgen in de werking van zon groep en dat onderwijzers erover spreken met de kinderen aan het begin van het schooljaar in de brugklas je kunt meidenvenijn maar beter voor zijn
6566260 jongens zijn directer ze gaan gewoon slaan zonder op te letten of een volwassene doorheeft wat er gebeurt meisjes gaan konkelen en zorgen dat dit zich buiten het zicht van volwassenen afspeelt
6566261 meidenvenijn krijgt in het basisonderwijs en voortgezet onderwijs nog te weinig aandacht er wordt te gemakkelijk gezegd ach het zijn meiden het is maar een fase dit hoort erbij maar als je echt buitengesloten wordt of als je je bedreigd voelt kan dat veel schade berokkenen
6566262 de leerkracht moet met de meiden gaan zitten en erover praten natuurlijk neemt het niet altijd alle spanning weg maar vaak pikken toch een paar meiden er wel iets van op en verschuift er dan toch wat in zon groepje
6566263 dat is echt een drempel voor zon meid zeg haar dat ze er niet alleen voor staat en dan moet je haar overreden om er zelf iets aan te doen laat haar iemand kiezen een docent bijvoorbeeld die ze helemaal vertrouwt op school en daarmee gaan praten als zij het pesten zelf aankaart doen de meeste scholen daar echt wel wat mee
6566264 als iemand van buiten erbij wil komen gaat dat moeilijk
6566265 dat ze nu jaloers zijn omdat ik met de krant praat dan negeren ze me maar dat is na een dagje wel weer over hoor
6566266 gingen we n meisje buitensluiten en nooit doen wat zij wilde
6566267 ik ben ook wel eens gepest toen gingen we badmintonnen met gym en pakten ze het veertje af toen kregen we echt super erge ruzie
6566268 de meester neemt ons mee naar een kamertje waar niemand ons hoort en dan praten we over wat er gebeurd is dan stopt het meestal wel
6566269 met dit lespakket willen we met de kinderen in contact komen en proberen hun vertrouwen te winnen zodat ze durven te praten over hun ervaringen met groepjes

6566293 my only point is that others who did the same but were not notable were not similarly treated or targeted by the defense in the palfrey litigation
6566294 to put it plainly these expenses are the result of some pretty unofficial activities
6566295 raccomanda al dipartimento della polizia di denver di non arrestare o incarcerare nessuna persona di et superiore ai 21 anni trovata in possesso di fino ad unoncia di marijuana durante la convention democratica
6566296 non vogliono che si sprechino i soldi dei contribuenti per punire chi sia in possesso di una sostanza meno dannosa dellalcol ci aspettiamo che la polizia rispetti questa richiesta avranno del resto molte altre cose da fare

6566304 kazi began broadcasting on the 88 7 fm frequency in 1982 the station was launched by a group of students and community organizers led by the late john warfield professor of african american studies at the university of texas as a media outlet designed to provide an african american voice in austin in the early days the station focused on news and information programming and the music played was primarily gospel
6566305 a wide variety of music programming covers jazz blues reggae r amp b gospel hip hop rap pop and zydeco what station manager steve savage refers to as the sounds of blackness all music that started from a black form all of the music programming has an emphasis on local music classics and underground sounds the hip hop and r amp b played on kazi for example differs dramatically one might even say refreshingly from that played on the citys two commercial stations
6566306 the plane was wobbling from one side to another i dont know what happened next i was in a sort of river and saw people smoke explosions
6566307 that plane is not taking off its eating up the runway
6566308 as it swerved its left wing touched the ground there was an explosion and the plane broke apart
6566309 if anyone offered me any high office in u s government id be greatly honored and id talk to him certainly i would talk to sen obama if he wanted to talk about it but i think the chance of an offer are pretty slim

6566311 no questions we let you in but there can be no questions promise
6566312 no questions from the floor thats the deal any questions and its over
6566313 the conventions serve as big advertisements for the presidential candidates and congressional leadership and these lawmakers know which corporations are paying for their ads
6566314 its closer to the time when voters are paying closer attention
6566315 i dont think either of them will get much of anything
6566316 my gut feeling is a lot of people are going to be barbecuing
6566317 i think the bounce is dependent on the convention a strong positive good convention
6566318 this does not absolve individuals within the organizations from possible recourse

6566320 is a universe in itself with its own strange centers of gravity its own fresh heroes and fools its own new resolution of pressures and forces its own irrecapturable mood of stage and place
6566321 i always knew that the first jewish president would be an episcopalian
6566322 obamas people have to be sensitive to the criticism that hes just a rock star
6566323 i think hes got to fill in the dots about himself
6566324 we had the big rally in commodity markets and the tsx benefited from that
6566325 we think the tone is more bullish and we suspect that the market made a near term bottom as a consequence

6566337 we have been made aware of a security breach at the offices of an external contractor involving the loss of personal information about offenders in england and wales
6566338 a full investigation is being conducted police and the information commissioner have been informed all transfer of data to the external contractor has been suspended pending investigation
6566339 the public will be losing confidence in jacqui smith who has failed yet again to tighten security despite a series of data mishandling fiascos
6566340 the information commissioner is being consulted about the prospect of some of these criminals asking to be re housed and suing the government under the data protection act because their privacy has been breached
6566341 the british taxpayer will be absolutely outraged if they are made to pick up the bill for compensation to serious criminals she must tell us now what advice the information commissioner is giving her on this farcical situation
6566342 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses more personal information has been reported lost it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times
6566343 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6566344 in the interests of public health the food safety authority of ireland is advising that products processed on the same production line as the salmonella positive products at dawn farm foods plant no 734 should not be used
6566345 a confirmed case in finland has eaten beef strips from a branch of the retail chain implicated in ireland and the uk
6566346 this is a serious outbreak with one fatality already we want to ensure that the controls that are in place are effective and that new cases are investigated as quickly as possible to ensure that no other sources are identified
6566347 on the basis that they are intended for further cooking before consumption
6566348 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6566349 i believe leaving the animal research where it is a good decision
6566350 what if an outbreak would occur here in the middle of cattle country how many dollars damage would be done to feeding livestock breeding livestock and the nations food supply
6566351 there are dangers when working with large animals and there is the possibility of humans carrying the virus outside the facility
6566352 human error does happen and an accidental discharge of fmd in kansas could wipe out the entire livestock industry on the great plains plum island offers a natural barrier to disease and in addition is a long ways from the heart of the beef industry this issue is just too important to be a part of the political spoils system
6566353 have the capability to research the planets most caustic organisms and their effect on humans as well
6566354 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6566355 the same people who are responsible for what happened in walkerton
6566356 if you download responsibilities to industry itself so that they would be self policing themselves that it would lead to greater problems within our food system
6566357 what were striving to do is actually do a more proactive role within the plant situation
6566358 as opposed to having our inspectors standing line by line theyll have a more oversight role within the plant itself
6566359 if that same mistake had been made in a small local abattoir or bakery or canning plant at worst youre going to kill off a few neighbours
6566360 not the be all and end all of food safety knowledge
6566361 governments there to set some standards and some level of accountability
6566362 the supply chain from farm right through to retailer or restaurant often have far higher standards than government minimal standards

6566365 he and his neoconservative foreign policy types that he agreed with are one of the reasons that george w bush decided to go to iraq
6566366 im sure he mccain loves his country its just that loving your country and lying to the american people are apparently not inconsistent in his view

6566368 hablando con pol ticos experimentados y yo no soy uno de ellos as como el an lisis que hemos hecho sobre lo que llamo la fortaleza y debilidades como candidatura ha quedado establecido que tengo una imagen de respeto y de experiencia que es a mi juicio lo que est n buscando los j venes votantes en el momento que experimenta el pa s
6566369 entre las fortalezas que identificaron estos alcaldes de gran experiencia en la pol tica es que mi edad proyecta bien con los j venes porque alegan que tengo un perfil profesional
6566370 these are young people who are largely uneducated and unprepared for the high wage jobs in the new economies of california
6566371 improving water productivity and reducing the quantity of food wasted can enable us to provide a better diet for the poor and enough food for growing populations
6566372 thats like leaving the tap running and pouring 40 trillion litres of water into the garbage can enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
6566373 i was very surprised with the high numbers but it catches everybodys attention
6566374 so there is a distribution problem but this also reflects the maldistribution of water
6566375 curbing these losses and improving water productivity provides win win opportunities for farmers business ecosystems and the global hungry
6566376 uk water footprint the impact of the uks food and fibre consumption on global water resources
6566377 only 38 percent of uks total water use comes from its own rivers lakes and groundwater reserves
6566378 that whole market has a lot of the same needs as the regular laptop market so it would make sense
6566379 its always fun to come up with unique pairings cast reunions and surprising personalities as presenters on the emmy show and this year weve got a number of those

6566387 he has lots of experience at the top level and his international record is phenomenal
6566388 i know roy keane from my manchester united days and its a privilege to join him at sunderland
6566389 im well aware of the passion of the sunderland fans having played at the stadium of light a few times and i cant wait to get going its an exciting move for me
6566390 i was real excited to be a part of an organization that hes in because hes turned programs around hes won championships hes been around the best
6566391 and im just very excited to learn from him and play for him
6566392 when i say we i talk about myself bill parcells jeff ireland and what we are trying to get accomplished right now
6566393 at the end of this process one of the things i told my players last night is we picked you we picked you to be here i think thats important for them to know that
6566394 every one of those guys there is 80 of them in that room right now theyre all mine we picked them
6566395 they all have the same hard work mentality and doing the little things and winning you can tell theyre all like that and all have camaraderie together
6566396 somebody will mess up or miss a block or drop a ball and youll just see him scoot over to him and whisper something in their ear
6566397 that coaching mentality that coaching is still in his heart he always wants to be part of the team
6566398 i think its good to have a guy with that record and that kind of nobility that he has about coaching turn us around and keep us rolling
6566399 theyre the ones that are charged with the day to day dealings with the miami dolphins im just trying to get the structure in place thats what im charged with doing thats my job and its not the same kind of job ive had before and people cant separate that
6566400 he demands the respect just the way he approaches each and every day
6566401 paramore jacks mannequin phantom planet paper route asbury park 8 16
6566402 why would they report two different sets of results from the same data
6566403 we in medicine want the facts and science and prefer to have it in the medical literature and not in a press conference that is highly orchestrated
6566404 the suggestion that sir petos work in this matter has somehow been influenced by the companies is insulting to him and entirely untrue
6566405 theres a body medical literature that says those very plant sterols can inhibit the growth of cancer
6566406 if it aint got pork in it it aint food
6566407 it gives us some momentum sure but i think a one time win also shows up all the challenges we face as a league we cant match the world cup or the olympics but what we can do is manage expectations be conservative and get the message out that our new league will be a platform for the worlds best players
6566408 love and blood at the world cup with the footballers fans and freaks
6566409 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
6566410 this nation was built on a foundation of free speech the first principle of free speech is protected conscience
6566411 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6566412 planned parenthood continues to be concerned that the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6566413 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6566414 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6566415 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience

6566417 chinglish is very often funny because of the sometimes scarily direct nature of the new meaning produced by the translation
6566418 it costs more to find a customer than to keep a customer
6566419 a content management system cms is computer software used to create edit manage and publish content in a consistently organized fashion cmss
6566420 hes very excited and just looking forward to getting up there and joining his teammates and pitching on saturday
6566421 hes worked extremely hard to put himself in this position and to be able to come back and compete at the highest level this season i think its just a testament to how hard hes pushed himself to rejoin his club before the end of the season
6566422 if the dollars value continues to decrease and if the political crisis becomes worse the oil price would reach up to 500
6566423 if there is another war in the region it will not only be irans oil not reaching the market but rather the oil of the whole region would be cut from the market
6566424 in that case we will not have a price rise we will have a price explosion
6566425 but by the same token we know these very same people are not interested in less religiosity in the political discourse they almost universally want a religious person as president
6566426 its not that they want to take religion out of politics its that their frustrations with the way things seem to be going are leading them to say well maybe churches should back off on this

6566428 i think john mccain is grossly underestimated and obamas strengths are overestimated and his weaknesses not understood

6566430 this is the true story of growing up in fiji in these years
6566431 i try to forget the last race as soon as its over and start thinking about the next one
6566432 last week we found ourselves at three tracks where track position was everything we qualified well all three nights in north dakota and in two cases didnt make the draw positions for the dash and that really hurt our chances tuesday night we put ourselves in a good position to break through by winning our heat and drawing the pole for the dash but traffic didnt go our way in the feature so well have to keep fighting out there we seem to be streaky at times as far as getting wins in bunches were hoping to start another streak in edmonton friday night
6566433 were always pretty confident but going to places where youve been good before helps the thing you cant do is be overconfident because things in this sport are always changing something that worked before may not work now and what we did at castrol last year may not be good this year thats where having a good crew comes into play this tsr crew rick warner shane bowers and kyle sundby is the best out here and i know well all be paying attention to details so that we can get the armor all chevy parkerstore no 15 back where we want to be in victory lane
6566434 external conditions aside we continue to deliver improved earnings with healthy margins
6566435 one of the key reasons for the success of the chevrolet cobalt and pontiac g5 is the lordstown work force and the strong partnerships with the uaw and local and state officials
6566436 our goal for the chevrolet cruze is to lead in fuel economy in this very competitive car segment
6566437 our society is run by insane people for insane objectives i think were being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and i think im liable to be put away as insane for expressing that thats whats insane about it
6566438 yahoo and hallelujah brother pass the sugar the infestation of starschmucks on every corner and across the street for people on the other sidewalk is finally nearing its end other better coffee shops will hopefully be able to compete again
6566439 to paraphrase dennis leary maybe now we can order some freaking coffee flavored coffee again and well again be able to use english words like small medium and large to communicate how much coffee we want
6566440 let the empire of tart coffee served by pompous teenagers crumble
6566441 the true story of a horse named shadow as told by his owner a german horse journalist
6566442 in the face of injustice one may not look the other way when someone suffers and it is not you he comes first to watch over a man who grieves is a more urgent duty than to think of god
6566443 according to jewish tradition creation did not end with man it began with him when he created man god gave him a secret and that secret was not how to begin but how to begin again
6566444 leaving the calm of the desert moses plunged into the whirlpool of history
6566445 who knows perhaps gods decision not to let him enter the promised land was meant as a reward rather than as punishment
6566446 for more than a century ichthyologists have thought that pacific and atlantic goliath grouper were the same species

6566448 derzeit ist es sehr schwer einfluss auf werbung dachgestaltung oder farbigkeit eines geb udes zu nehmen
6566449 ein geb ude wie das des architekten david chipperfield f r den kunstsammler heiner bastian erf llt alle diese kriterien und ist unbestreitbar zeitgen ssisch
6566450 es gibt genug bereiche wo die moderne sich austoben kann

6566452 der pariser platz s he heute nicht so aus wie er jetzt meist bewundert wird wenn es damals nicht gestaltungsregeln gegeben h tte
6566453 auffassung vertraten dass die gro en geister der akademie in ihren gestaltungsabsichten nicht von kleinlichen bauvorschriften beschr nkt werden d rfen
6566454 das beispiel des genehmigungsverfahrens f r den rosa betonbunker des kaufhauses alexa am alexanderplatz zeigt doch dass trotz massiver einflussnahme der landespolitik ja sogar trotz eines wettbewerbs und eines guten architekten am ende etwas entstehen kann was keinem gef llt

6566458 jetzt werden die innenminister sich untereinander nicht mehr trauen k nnen
6566459 w hrend der vergangenen herbstkonferenz der innenminister wurde zwischen senator ehrhart k rting und dem damaligen hamburger amtskollegen nagel die absprache getroffen kollegen nach berlin zur ckholen zu wollen
6566460 man darf bei der diskussion nicht au er acht lassen dass die vom land berlin ausgebildeten 502 beamten von hamburg als vollwertige vollzugsbeamte bernommen wurden ohne dass die hansestadt sich wenigstens anteilig an den kosten f r diese ausbildung beteiligt h tte dass herr glietsch sich jetzt auch vielleicht gegen die meinung einzelner mitarbeiter f r das anschreiben entschlossen hat ist aufgrund dieser grundlage durchaus nachvollziehbar
6566461 es gibt bereits ger chte wonach ein bestimmtes bundesland einer vielzahl von bewerbern f r den gehobenen dienst empfohlen hat sich mangels eigener ausbildungsm glichkeiten in berlin zum polizisten schulen zu lassen um nach erfolgreichem durchlauf der ausbildung in das eigene land zur ckzukehren
6566462 somit w rde das finanzielle ruinierte berlin die polizeiausbildung anderer bundesl nder finanzieren ohne selbst davon profitieren zu k nnen
6566463 polizeipr sident glietsch kann auch nur die stellen besetzen und die geh lter zahlen die ihm von der politik bewilligt werden das land hamburg hat davon profitiert dass wir keine freien stellen hatten die hansestadt hat 500 gute beamte quasi auf dem silbertablett serviert bekommen
6566464 wenn hamburg uns nun davon nur sieben zur ckgeben will ist es nur clever vom pr sidenten weitere zu k dern zumal es sich bei den 21 betroffenen um kollegen handelt die ernste gr nde f r eine r ckkehr haben
6566465 why do pundits still suggest saving up for an emergency fund nobody does it stop beating a dead horse and come up with another suggestion
6566466 you find out anyone and everyone tries to take it away from you it doesnt make happiness it creates a lot of problems you know
6566467 now the decision makers choose whether to give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down
6566468 discussions are ongoing with the iraqis to finalize a bilateral agreement
6566469 we are working to complete the agreement but it is not final yet
6566470 we have to let go and were not reluctant to do that and the iraqis are not reluctant to take control
6566471 there is a measure of hope in iraq that was not present 18 months ago
6566472 now thats just a measure of hope its not a celebration
6566473 iran zal nog binnen het decennium een eerste astronaut lanceren
6566474 also our members are very committed to their job so walking off the job is a major issue for them
6566475 we know there are major understaffing issues in the banks already so any staff not being at work will put pressure on those services
6566476 there will be some regional branches that close but were not anticipating significant branch closures to be fair thats actually not the point the point is to send a strong message to the bank that we expect them to be a good corporate citizen
6566477 i dont think anyone would have picked this we were only advised today of a meeting being held so to some extent its a bolt from the blue
6566478 were absolutely gutted for 145 hard working dunedin people who will lose their employment but the capital investment of more than 50m id have to say for the long term security of the plant its not a bad thing
6566479 hopefully its good news the fact were committed to staying here were saying its a viable future here will put a lot of peoples minds to rest

6566508 netsuite was a lot more cost effective than other platforms which is important for a growing company like ours
6566509 but the real beauty of netsuite is that it gives us total access to the information we need to grow our business i dont know how we would manage without netsuite
6566510 caviar is a unique product and the challenges in making and selling it are unique as well
6566511 it takes a special program to cope with all that and fortunately weve found it in netsuite
6566512 its funny we see or lives as a kid and it never occurs to us that it wont work out that way
6566513 i cant imagine that if somebody is on the wrong side of the road speeding and he kills two guys and now they know exactly where he was drinking and have it on tape if you cant win that case im not sure which case you can win

6566520 so now it is the first time and they saw a very good game
6566521 we came into these olympic games everybody came into the games planning on winning
6566522 we came here to do big things but at the end of the day i can only control what i do i had my mind set that i wanted to go out and run a great race i have been training hard i wanted to be a gold medalist
6566523 you never know if you are going to win i know from the past of hurdlers who have clipped the last hurdle and they have lost the race i knew that i was in good shape coming into this i also knew my opponents were very good in terms of shape so i could not drop my guard
6566524 ever since i ran a 22 05 in 2004 i have been struggling to get my 200 meter time back to where it was
6566525 and i am just thankful to god that this year with the help of my coach and my motivation and the people around me i was able to get back to where i want to be
6566526 it was my dream of course to win the olympic games
6566527 my dream was also to throw over 70 meters i did not expect that i would have to throw over 70 5 meters to win the olympic games well it is like a miracle for me

6566560 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
6566561 while gas and food prices are increasing and home values are declining the rise in health care costs is surpassing income growth and fewer people have adequate insurance as a result working people are struggling to pay their bills and accruing medical debt

6566563 it hurts i was hoping to achieve a lot more everyone had to jump a seasons best or a national record so it was a tough competition really close all the way to the end but it wasnt enough so i just have to make do with a silver medal
6566564 i cant believe that im standing here at the olympic games with a silver medal and im really pissed ive come a long way last time i was not even in the mix to fight for a medal it would have taken an outdoor pb but ive been in such great form this year that i believed i could do it
6566565 oh man another four years but i will go on im a winner and i dont want to be content with silver im not happy about it but theres enough people in the world who can only dream about competing at the olympic games let along picking up a medal

6566569 if theres one important lesson that can be drawn from the blockbuster performance of warner bros the dark knight its that audiences arent afraid of a comic book movie that takes a walk on the dark grim side
6566570 however the same cant necessarily be said for fox topper tom rothman
6566571 despite the fact that the gritty hugh jackman topped film was met with a giddy response at this years comic con jeff wells says that rothman is pressuring director gavin hood to make the movie more kid friendly
6566572 perhaps rothman has taken his fan letter from steven spielberg too much to heart but a child friendly wolverine feels less

6566580 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
6566581 i dont have any pain really ive just got a bloody nose and obviously the swelling beyond that i feel fine pain wise
6566582 i can see out of my right eye when i open it its just easier right now to keep it closed
6566583 but the way they made it sound with the fractures is that nothing is out of place when the swelling goes does they think i can just let it heal and go from there
6566584 i tried to pull back and get out of the way i saw the ball and it was about a foot away and i closed my eye and said oh oh then it hit me
6566585 had i not been squared to bunt i think i could have protected myself a little better since i was squared i was more exposed its just one of those things that happened
6566586 shed be worse if i was in pain i really havent been in a whole lot of pain its been more a case that i cant see out of my right eye my nose has been constantly bleeding since it happened
6566587 i dont have any pain really ive just got a bloody nose and obviously the swelling beyond that i feel fine pain wise
6566588 i can see out of my right eye when i open it its just easier right now to keep it closed
6566589 but the way they made it sound with the fractures is that nothing is out of place when the swelling goes does they think i can just let it heal and go from there
6566590 i tried to pull back and get out of the way i saw the ball and it was about a foot away and i closed my eye and said oh oh then it hit me
6566591 had i not been squared to bunt i think i could have protected myself a little better since i was squared i was more exposed its just one of those things that happened
6566592 shed be worse if i was in pain i really havent been in a whole lot of pain its been more a case that i cant see out of my right eye my nose has been constantly bleeding since it happened
6566593 i think it was probably a sign of the times
6566594 but children will be children and some children make a choice other than what you would wish
6566595 i believe when you tell a child to stop a behavior we must give them a replacement behavior thats a better one
6566596 i really dont think life is about the i could have beens life is only about the i tried to do i dont mind the failure but i cant imagine that id forgive myself if i didnt try
6566597 porque algunas determinaciones que se tomen requieren de modificaciones al marco legal
6566598 this isnt a sport we would anticipate could achieve medals in 2012
6566599 but were looking at how the sport takes itself from nowhere in the uk
6566600 its not possible to bring an adult up to the standard the level is high and you cant just start at 16
6566601 ill give you some advice dont just take tall people its not basketball you need everyone tall strong for defence and small and agile
6566602 theyre a bunch of sharks in the locker room if they can smell blood they will go for you and thats what they have done with federer
6566603 if he doesnt win the us open thats going to make it even harder for him to win grand slams next season everyone in tennis was debating how many grand slams beyond the record federer would get but now you have to pull back from that now there is real doubt whether federer can actually get there i believe it is going to be difficult for federer to beat sampras record
6566604 lets put it this way petes sleeping a little better than he was a few months ago
6566605 hes thinking maybe i actually have a chance to hold on to this thing its not out of the question that 14 is going to be enough its not going to be easy to just mow through it the way most of us thought pete talked about federer getting to 17 18 and i thought he was going to get it but you always hit that spot when it starts to get tougher when pete hit 14 i thought god whos going to get there and its pretty amazing that roger has got so close roger is 27 and how many did pete win after 27 it doesnt get any easier what roger has done is amazing he has had four of the greatest years in the open era no one can keep that up
6566606 i think his most consistent and dominant years may be behind him but im not sure if that means that his best is behind him there is plenty of great tennis left in him and i see him passing petes record of 14 majors
6566607 usually he just hits his forehands without thinking its as simple as brushing his teeth but in beijing i saw that he was thinking too much that he was doubting himself maybe hell win the us open and hell get his game and his confidence back but im not so sure
6566608 maybe federer has been spending too much time on the promotional work and he needs to rededicate and refocus himself on what he wants to achieve in tennis i think that federer needs to get back to the basics he needs to work hard he needs to put the hours in on the practice court i think that nadal has a real physical edge over federer im not saying that federer needs to develop biceps like nadal but its all about two words hard work
6566609 ich bin psychisch so von der rolle das ich regelrecht fressen muss
6566610 to be beaten by two people who have thrown 70m i cant do any more
6566611 but fourth is a difficult place to finish you could see it was going to be a big champion ship and i think it was one of the greatest finals ever and i feel very proud to have been part of it
6566612 this has been a very successful bit of water for us over the last two weeks
6566613 le quitaramos esa porqueria que no sirve para nada pongale el anterior xp creo o no se el que sea pero quitale este que trae
6566614 was as good as anything she has done but the edge had gone in the second i felt i had to carry her and there are only so many fences you can do that
6566615 it just does not get any better than this you always dream about this but dont know if it is ever going to happen with this i want to put all the past behind me
6566616 hickstead has been a winner throughout his entire career hes not very big but he tries and hes very careful when bengtsson had the last fence down it helped of course but i decided to go as fast as i could and chance it
6566617 its like a lance armstrong story hes a gentleman and a great ambassador for the sport and hes olympic champion now
6566618 it was my fault i went too early i let myself down the team down and the country down
6566619 the set up of the team was wrong if you are asking questions as to why this happened then it has to be the coach doesnt it he has been brought in to do this its his job
6566620 he is now being placed under strict conditions on parole until completion of his sentence

6566624 even without those whoppers attached to her jj would still be a stunningly beautiful girl
6566625 as it is though shes a major force to be reckoned with she reminds me quite a bit of sierra and i can only hope she follows in her footsteps into the realm of nasty hardcore should rightfully be crowned 2008 newcomer of the year but will doubtless lose out to karina hart oh did i mention her smile amazing
6566626 i posed to start a savings account so i can get some tits
6566627 i know you cant tell but they actually do im a real redhead from the hair on my head to the pubes on my pussy but since its bikini season i shaved them all off after this barbeque im gonna skinny dip in the pool so i wanted my slit to be nice and smooth not only does it look pretty shaved but it feels awesome when the cold water touches my bare lips
6566628 who cares i want to get naked if they talk crap about me its just cause theyre jealous most of the people here know i can be a little wild anyway im an exhibitionist and half of my friends have seen me naked some people think thats slutty of me but i think they secretly wish they could be as comfortable in their skin as i am in mine i look good and i enjoy being naked so why not and my pussy needs some room to breathe too it gets suffocated from being trapped in my tight little panties all day long
6566629 im going to let the campaign speak for the campaign
6566630 i dont have any pits the one i did have i turned it in to the county and it was mine
6566631 i heard the chicken is real good they call it jailbird
6566632 i cant have beer around that would be nonsense were not going to sell alcohol here not at all we dont have no intentions
6566633 while i was sheriff i cooked for all the county christmas parties for nine years so they wouldnt have to hire anybody id cook for 300 400 people it kind of saved the county some money
6566634 weve won chicken before and weve won ribs and i think we came in second place or third place with brisket before
6566635 the commitment is there and continues to be there and nova scotians are going to get the benefit
6566636 they encana are working now to look at what can should be or will be substituted but make no mistake there will be a substitute for that
6566637 we expect the government to ensure that the people of our industry who will be most directly impacted by the decision on replacement activity will have a substitution project that is suitable enough to enable them to continue plying their trade
6566638 i messed with kim a while ago she licked on my balls before the deal when they werent worth much she licked my balls once and now shes a star i got some advice for all aspiring women journalists it may not make the best sellers list but lick my balls and you are on the road to the riches

6566739 we can confirm that mr gadd has left bangkok and is heading to the uk
6566740 thailand is not allowing him to enter the country and hong kong is turning him back so there is no choice for him now
6566741 this clearly illustrates why its so important to have binding agreements between countries which will prevent sex offenders hopping from one place to another and possibly going underground where they will pose a serious threat to children

6566778 it says it has increased the efficiency of a technique for wirelessly powering consumer gadgets and computers a development that could allow a person to simply place a device on a desktop countertop to power it it could bring the consumer electronics industry a step closer to a world without wires

6566786 the fact that john mccain dispatched his paid consultant to launch this despicable ad from a so called independent committee shows how desperate he is to change the subject from his shocking disconnect with the economic struggles of the american people said spokesman tommy vietor in a statement
6566787 he knows that barack obama has denounced the detestable crimes that bill ayers committed forty years ago instead of invoking paris britney and obscure sixties radicals senator mccain should take the day off at one of his seven homes to consider whether his support for outsourcing tax breaks for companies who ship jobs overseas and continued spending of ten billion a month in iraq is really putting country first to us it sounds like just more of the same
6566788 sen obama certainly has one when he bought his million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon
6566789 thats a house that he could not have bought without mr rezkos actions
6566790 it raises questions about his judgment and you know it is an issue that we think the american people care far more about than how many houses or properties or dog houses that john and cindy mccain have

6566799 the power pack for your laptop isnt that efficient its one of those things thats almost too good to be true
6566800 that to me is the most striking part about it transmitting 60 watts at 75 percent efficiency over several feet
6566801 the power pack for your laptop isnt that efficient its one of those things thats almost too good to be true
6566802 for me its like a confirmation that its so exciting its something people would like to have

6566819 diesel fuel fires did not play a role in the collapse of wtc 7 the worst case scenarios associated with fires being fed by the ruptured fuel lines could not have been sustained long enough or could not have generated sufficient heat to raise the temperature of a critical column i e column 79 to the point of significant loss of strength or stiffness
6566820 you can lock me up and throw away the key

6566844 la claridad de la orden no puede soslayarse por un guardi n del inpec mucho menos por un director
6566845 al pretenderse la efectividad del mecanismo sustitutivo se encontr la sala con una respuesta descomedida e inaceptable por parte del entonces director del inpec en la cual abusivamente desde luego y demorando conscientemente el cumplimiento de la sentencia inquir a a la corte acerca de la improcedencia de la sustituci n alegando que ella no proced a por v a de la ley 750 de 2002 queriendo ignorar que precisamente la sala hab a descartado tal mecanismo aplicando en cambio por favorabilidad las normas de la ley 906 04 semejante actitud de una autoridad administrativa frente a una judicial que no tiene cabida en un estado de derecho
6566846 la claridad de la orden y de su condicionamiento no puede soslayarse ni siquiera por un guardi n del inpec mucho menos por un director general quien as impidi que la directora del penal pudiera hacer efectiva la sustituci n

6566852 the united states maintained about 130 military advisers in georgia along with civilian advisers contractors involved in all aspects of the georgian government and people doing business in georgia it is inconceivable that the americans were unaware of georgias mobilization and intentions it is also inconceivable that the americans were unaware that the russians had deployed substantial forces on the south ossetian frontier u s technical intelligence from satellite imagery and signals intelligence to unmanned aerial vehicles could not miss the fact that thousands of russian troops were moving to forward positions the russians clearly knew the georgians were ready to move how could the united states not be aware of the russians indeed given the posture of russian troops how could intelligence analysts have missed the possibility that the russians had laid a trap hoping for a georgian invasion to justify its own counterattack

6566913 were actually projecting this year that the north pole may be free of ice for the first time in history
6566914 this summers forecast and unusual early melting events all around the arctic serve as a dire warning of how quickly the polar regions are being affected by climate change
6566915 if norways average temperature this year equals that in 2007 the ice cap in the arctic will all melt away which is highly possible judging from current conditions
6566916 as you can see ice has grown in nearly every direction since last summer with a large increase in the area north of siberia also note that the area around the northwest passage west of greenland has seen a significant increase in ice some of the islands in the canadian archipelago are surrounded by more ice than they were during the summer of 1980
6566917 the arctic did not experience the meltdowns forecast by nsidc and the norwegian polar year secretariat it didnt even come close additionally some current graphs and press releases from nsidc seem less than conservative there appears to be a consistent pattern of overstatement related to arctic ice loss

6566947 how does 2 years in the senate and a few years in the illinois state senate qualify you to run for president
6566948 theyve theyve ended up nominating and placing at the top of their ticket somebody whos not qualified who has not earned it
6566949 i now refer to my bowel movements as limbaugh moments
6566950 it is considered the most powerful post in texas government because its occupant controls the work of the texas senate and controls the budgeting process as a leader of the legislative budget board
6566951 there are even some advantages to not having become mired in washington politics for decades
6566952 bush went in with the idea that he was qualified but in the end he was presumptuous and essentially tried to bully everyone
6566953 he lieks seegars n dey luk liek cockz zomg lol
6566954 must have hit it pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that huh kid
6566955 hes trying to say that everyones afraid of being called a racist so they fear that being critical of obama will incite the pack of retarded kids above this post
6566956 i think what weve had here is a little is a little social concern in the nfl the media has been very desirous that a black quarter back do well mcnabb got a lot of the credit of the performance of the team that he really didnt deserve
6566957 striking how unqualified obama is and how this whole thing came about within the democrat party i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6566958 there will be no peace until the blacks stop calling themselves black and the whites stop calling themselves white

6566964 well sen obama on behalf of white america i would just like to say go fist yourself face
6566965 obama won primaries becuase no one had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6566966 well im a woman and i want to vote for a woman but im also black and want to vote for a black person
6566967 obama is unqualified do you think that hes gotten this far because hes black and people wont bring up the issue
6566968 no obama you are black and won fair and square but we arent going to allow you to be the nominee
6566969 i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6566970 you know obama is an ok guy that does his best to work with democrats and republicans alike and would actually make a great president
6566971 doesnt rush limbaugh remind you of one of those gay guys who likes to lay in a tub while other men pee on him
6566972 unh unh i cant get hard reagan pee in my mouth
6566973 but no i dont do drugs any more than the average touring psychadelic funk band
6566974 why dont you actually try to prove me wrong and tell me how exactly obama is any different from all the other slime in office

6566977 mi piace pensarlo cos come un muro con una crepa
6566978 chiudevo il portone di corsa e salivo le scale senza guardarmi indietro di corsa perch istintivo pensare che se corri avanti ti sar pi facile non voltarti indietro perch pensi che pi vai lontano e pi vedrai piccolo quello che ti sei lasciata alle spalle ma le regole della prospettiva non sono valide in amore puoi andare lontano mille miglia mesi anni ma baster girarti un attimo abbassare per un solo secondo le difese e lasciarti vincere dal ricordo per ritorvarlo l bello come sempre con i suoi occhi appiccicati ai tuoi con la sua mano che cerca di trattenerti con il suo pizzetto e la sua barba di qualche giorno che irrita la pelle con la sua bocca che viaggia sul tuo corpo viaggia s perch lamore conosce strani mezzi di trasporto ti baster quellattimo per capire che non sei andata poi cos lontano che non hai fatto tanta strada baster a farti risentire fragile a darti laffanno ma questo lho capito dopo ai quei tempi mi bastava scappare fare le scale di corsa e pensare gi di dimenticarlo poi per me lo ritrovavo nel cuore in un gesto distratto che tanto piaceva a lui nei capelli lasciati sciolti per essere accarezzati meglio nel vestito del primo appuntamento nelle scarpe della fuga nei capelli color carbone di un ragazzo visto per strada
6566979 me ne resto a pancia in su e penso quante cose sono cambiate questanno quanta vita nuova ha preso forma e non mi piace questa forma preferisco un altro stampo vorrei un mondo pi docile che non ti scappa dal guinzaglio che non ti trascina dove vuole lui un modo piccolo che te lo metti in tasca come un portachiavi un cielo attento che non ti dimentica e penso che sarebbe bello se la vita fosse come le cr pe che puoi farcire come vuoi ci vuoi le noccioline e ci metti le noccioline ci vuoi il cocco e ci metti il cocco ma la vita un cibo preconfezionato qualcuno ha scelto i gusti per te e tu che puoi fare niente o ti pieghi o ti spezzi io non mi voglio pi piegare ho voglia di rivoluzione tirer su le maniche e mi metter a impastare il mondo e non passer pi le notti a guardare il soffitto quante volte mi ha teniuto compagnia quanti sogni ci ho appiccicato stanno l appesi aspettando che qualcuno li raccolga le olive si raccolgono a novembre luva a settembre e i sogni non lo so forse ho seminato male forse non c stato abbastanza sole per tanto che aspetto e non cresce niente lalbero dei sogni non vuole dare frutti

6566982 prima o poi passa il vento e si va si va nel verso giusto che poi forse proprio quello sbagliato chiss si ma prima o poi passa il vento arriva un soffio e ti regala un po di movimento per me arrivato alluscita di una di quelle mattine tutte uguali ho scontrato una magia e da quel giorno cambiato tutto perch a volte ti serve un passo falso per capire come si cammina e dopo prendi il via ti serve un inciampo poi metti un piede dietro laltro e non cadi no stavolta no hai trovato lequilibrio ed una gran conquista

6566993 i think they have been a little bit unlucky if they had been able to keep the spaniards out for the last seven seconds spain scored with seconds to go to win 1 0 they could have gone right through i guess we are going to have to sit down with hockey and review how it went i think it is a talented team and its results dos not reflect that talent

6567000 the semifinal is always the hardest game in any tournament
6567001 we found our rhythm once we started to slow things down
6567002 i think everybody stepped up jenni screen had an amazing game and stepped right in and i think that our best is ahead of us
6567003 there is still a gap between our strength and that of the worlds best teams there are differences in personal abilities we didnt do well in rebounds and the physical side of the game was too much for us
6567004 i am genuinely concerned i think australians are beginning to feel genuinely concerned that less than 12 months after the last election they are going backwards in net terms
6567005 although you may not get much money back in some cases its better than nothing especially in these tough economic times and we all know how quickly the value of electronics depreciates so those poor saps holding onto their first generation iphones should probably unload them asap
6567006 during a study trip that you planned for fifth graders students were exposed to nude statues and other nude art representations
6567007 the first nudity in a museum case we have seen
6567008 but ive never heard of a teacher getting in trouble for taking her kiddoes on an approved trip to an art museum
6567009 i think you can walk into the dallas museum of art and see nothing that would cause concern
6567010 there was a parent who complained relating the complaint of a child
6567011 time was not used wisely for learning during the trip
6567012 this is not about a field trip to a museum
6567013 the timing of circumstances has allowed the teacher to wave that banner and it has played well in the media
6567014 no teachers job status however would be jeopardized based on students incidental viewing of nude art
6567015 his nude body has the radiant purity of an athlete in his prime
6567016 im so into art i look at it for its value what each civilization has left behind
6567017 she did mention some nude art but she didnt make a big deal of it and neither did i

6567029 edgy and intensely heated this cowboy story is especially good alison kent never fails to deliver
6567030 writings not rocket science its a helluva lot harder because once you learn all that rocket science crap you can at least in theory build a rocket on the other hand you can read every writing book known to man and attend classes and work with critique partners and get pages of editorial input and still end up with a book that doesnt quite hit the high notes scary but true
6567031 can i be blunt on this subject if you dont have time to read you dont have the time or the tools to write simple as that reading is the creative center of a writers life
6567032 you know im a storyteller we are storytellers and ours is an ancient tradition contemporized by the cinema and the capturing of light and we should all be very proud of our place in society on any given night millions of people across the world buy a ticket for adventures that only we as storytellers can provide we release burdens we galvanize emotions we make people laugh we make people talk over breakfast this is a great job and i want to encourage every one of you in this room to give everything you can to the story god bless narrative god bless originality
6567033 when i write i feel like an armless legless man with a crayon in his mouth
6567034 dont be afraid of your material or your past be afraid of wasting any more time obsessing about how you look and how people see you be afraid of not getting your writing done
6567035 my new years resolution is to focus on the book and forget all the crap that surrounds the writing business to lose myself in a story and not give a damn if it makes any lists has a good sell through gets glowing reviews on amazon pleases my editors hell even pleases my readers i want to love what im writing so much that none of the rest of it matters and if i dont i wont write it lifes too short to abuse the muse
6567036 america is now wholly given over to a d d mob of scribbling women and i should have no chance of success while the public taste is occupied with their trash and should be ashamed of myself if i did succeed what is the mystery of these innumberable editions of the lamplighter by maria susanna cummins and other books neither better nor worse worse they could not be and better they need not be when they sell by the hundred thousand
6567037 as for my next book i am going to hold myself from writing it till i have it impending in me grown heavy in my mind like a ripe pear pendant gravid asking to be cut or it will fall
6567038 the storyteller is deep inside everyone of us the story maker is always with us let us suppose our world is attacked by war by the horrors that we all of us easily imagine let us suppose floods wash through our cities the seas rise but the storyteller will be there for it is our imaginations which shape us keep us create us for good and for ill it is our stories that will recreate us when we are torn hurt even destroyed it is the storyteller the dream maker the myth maker that is our phoenix that represents us at our best and at our most creative

6567045 wtc 7 did not enter free fall according to nist analysis of wtc 7 video the building collapsed 18 stories in 5 3 seconds if the building exhibited free fall this process would have taken just 3 9 seconds the actual collapse time exceeded the free fall time by 40 percent

6567295 depending on the card and cooler it might be able to clock 400mhz or 100mhz it is very very card specific in general lower end cards clock better than higher end ones since theyre usually just basically downclocked versions of the more powerful cards based on the same core for instance the geforce 6600 will usually clock to around 560mhz while the 6600gt which has a stock clock of 500mhz as opposed to 300mhz on the 6600 usually also limits at about 560mhz the 7600gs has a stock core frequency of 450mhz and will go up to 600 610mhz while the 7600gt with 575mhz stock will go to 620 630mhz

6567329 two of the silliest pieces i have read on ya literature in ages

6567350 since our primary production takes place in mexico our european retailers can take advantage of the favorable exchange rates when importing our garments thus giving them a little more margin to work with
6567351 under nafta were a very favorable resource to retailers in mexico and canada as they dont have to face the 20 percent duties and taxes that can be levied on merchandise imported from china
6567352 ive worked to triple our international business over the last four years and these new additions are part of the overall strategic plan to quadruple our international presence by 2009 these new partnerships will help give us exposure in areas where we had limited presence previously and are part of our overall plan to increase international market share

6567378 but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6567379 accepted our position that memorandums of understanding with iraq do not have legal force especially when they have not been ratified by the iraqi parliament
6567380 the iraqi government still has not yet ratified an mou with the united states that was first signed in 2005
6567381 that means that trading the u n mandate for an mou with iraq is not only unconstitutional but there is also a serious risk that it will leave u s troops unprotected and exposed
6567382 if you trace the legislative history of the 2005 memo it is clear that isnt an option
6567383 put aside for a moment the issue of the mou avoiding the authority of the u s congress if it is signed but not ratified by two thirds vote in the iraqi parliament and the u n mandate expires u s troops will find themselves without legal protections and any authority to be in iraq
6567384 to me playing good defense is making the plays youre supposed to make

6567410 these bleak conditions are set to get worse for the rest of the year the labour market has remained fairly strong up until now but we predict that this will soften over the second half of 2008 as the number of people claiming unemployment benefit continues to rise
6567411 the credit crunch has now fully started to hit consumers and net wealth conditions are at a record low as predicted last quarter equity markets and property prices have continued to fall and combined with high levels of consumer debt this has caused the financial reality index to fall to its lowest ever level
6567412 as a consumer if i downloaded 90 percent of a movie and then got a time out that reduced my bandwidth id have to start over and that would not make me happy

6567420 its my home track in fact i started my racing career there they call sears point a drivers track and id like to think that bill and i are two of the best out there and with the way weve been running i dont think there is a better track to take our momentum to if we can get the setup close right out of the trailer we are going to be very tough to beat
6567421 i really want to win this race and i think we have the car to do it alex job greg fordahl and all of the guys have been giving us a perfect car now we just have to go out and get it done
6567422 with the experience our two drivers have at that track coupled with the experience that the team now has with the new car i expect to be on the podium there and quite frankly i expect to be on the top spot
6567423 i dont think any foreign internet company can effectively compete against chinese companies in the chinese market
6567424 the regulatory environment is so difficult that its almost impossible for foreigners to have an advantage over locals who have better political connections and who can manipulate the regulatory system much more effectively
6567425 they drive viewers to share in the olympic experience on network television in record numbers and as a result of this unprecedented digital effort consumers have a destination to watch thousands of hours of video and relive the great moments of these olympics
6567426 but you wouldnt say online blew out expectations people still prefer tv to online and its unknown whether its because tv is better or online is lacking

6567428 have shown some restraint in terms of investments in india due largely to the risk still associated with this emerging region
6567429 even though it requires work to develop strategies not to be a puppet on a string you could perhaps overcome these influences
6567430 automatic mental associations have the potential to distort peoples perceptions of reality
6567431 biased perception of the information provides the basis for future decisions leading them in one direction or another
6567432 the distorting influence of perception on reality is particularly pronounced when the information is ambiguous and in the political domain we often have to deal with ambiguous information
6567433 what these guys did thats particularly nice is follow people through the process
6567434 the basic structure of what theyre talking about could apply to political and social decisions
6567435 its much easier to create a negative association technically its possible to create a positive association but you need to work much harder
6567436 from the perspective of a voter who doesnt want to be a slave of their automatic mental associations our study can inform people of how their mind works and resolve the unawareness of unawareness
6567437 you can practice changing your cognition and being a little more thoughtful about how you approach things
6567438 the research now is looking at what strategies will change this
6567439 automatic mental associations have the potential to distort peoples perceptions of reality
6567440 biased perception of the information provides the basis for future decisions leading them in one direction or another

6567452 the first question organisations need to answer is whether their turnover rates are outside the norm and need addressing
6567453 the typical organisation in todays environment can view a five per cent staff turnover as a normal cost of doing business
6567454 it managers often worry that investments in training will be reaped by other organisations when it workers shop their new skills around
6567455 but this study indicates that investing in training is actually the best way to retain employees
6567456 while offering competitive salaries and benefit packages may be important for recruitment providing quality of life incentives and enhancing working environments are more important for retention
6567457 rather than releasing a totally new and updated standard this is a revision of 1
6567458 in the future as we move to standard 2 0 there will more than likely be pretty major changes but in this version weve come up with a lot more clarity and consolidated a number of sub requirements

6567474 these rat model tumors were developed from human glioblastoma tumor cells and closely mimic human tumors in growth patterns and response to therapy
6567475 the concept of targeting blood vessels that feed tumors as an approach to limit tumor growth is not a novel idea
6567476 however blocking the specific fatty acid described in this study is novel and holds great promise for use in humans
6567477 if survival time could be extended with a combination of surgical therapy and infusion with similar drugs this could be a significant treatment option
6567478 these pumps have been used in humans for other diseases and can be designed for delivery of these drugs as well
6567479 we believe they can be used to deliver drugs to block angiogenesis in complex human tumors such as glioblastomas
6567480 it is important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order
6567481 its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
6567482 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
6567483 to be very careful and sensitive these days the russians are selling many arms to iran and syria and there is no need to offer them an excuse to sell even more advanced weapons
6567484 both war and peace are in the hands of israeli jews
6567485 gal hirsch who was defeated in lebanon went to georgia and they too lost because of him
6567486 we have turned down many requests involving arms sales to georgia and the ones that have been approved have been duly scrutinized
6567487 its a damn poor mind that can only think of one way to spell a word
6567488 as a consumer if i downloaded 90 percent of a movie and then got a time out that reduced my bandwidth id have to start over and that would not make me happy
6567489 if its a t1 level you get 500 megabytes of downloading per day
6567490 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6567491 clearly demonstrate that false suggestions about childhood events can profoundly change peoples attitudes and behavior
6567492 in most cases the infection is pretty mild people might not even be aware they have it
6567493 they might have a mild flu like illness maybe some mild abdominal pain and diarrhea
6567494 i think if people have eaten any of these foods but feel perfectly well they have nothing more to worry about and the vast vast majority of people who have eaten these products will not get sick
6567495 those would be the manifestations of the severe form of the disease when it happens and its fortunately not common but when it happens it can be a very serious life threatening disease
6567496 it can be as short as a few days but it can my be as long as a couple of months complicating investigation of an outbreak because its very difficult for people to remember what theyve eaten a few weeks or a few months before
6567497 we have taken a much broader approach to the recall than the actual testing has indicated we need to
6567498 clearly in this case our standard has not been held
6567499 well work until we can find the source or until the outbreak is completed
6567500 i strongly advise the public especially those at high risk for listeriosis such as the elderly pregnant women and those with weak immune systems to make sure they avoid consuming these products
6567501 i have also asked all public health units to advise emergency rooms in their jurisdictions to be on alert for cases
6567502 food thats contaminated with listeria doesnt always look like its spoiled and the bacteria can also proliferate when its in the fridge
6567503 so its important for individuals to make sure they heat their food especially cold cuts and deli meats properly
6567504 its always fun to come up with unique pairings cast reunions and surprising personalities as presenters on the emmy show and this year weve got a number of those
6567505 and the good news is weve got plenty more to come

6567516 as soon as you stop wanting something you get it
6567517 but by the same token we know these very same people are not interested in less religiosity in the political discourse they almost universally want a religious person as president
6567518 its not that they want to take religion out of politics its that their frustrations with the way things seem to be going are leading them to say well maybe churches should back off on this
6567519 typically its the undecided voter that gives politicians a hard time its the undecided voters that you need to get
6567520 this study shows that by using these measures there is some potential for improving the prediction of election outcomes
6567521 the inspiration for this study came from the development of a particular class of measures that enables us to assess these automatic mental associations
6567522 over the past couple of years a lot of research has shown that these measures are able to predict behaviors that psychologists have had a hard time predicting with standard methodology or self report
6567523 most people do not think that young people have strokes
6567524 but the point people should really understand is that they can occur in utero they can occur in the neonatal period and they can occur in older children there are noticeable differences in presentation risk factors and the prognosis in children compared to older adults however
6567525 people are like kids dont have strokes so i still think theres a lot of work to be done in terms of awareness
6567526 every year we experience importation of measles from other countries and from those going abroad but this year is different once measles is imported here were seeing it spread to many more people
6567527 many cases are in children who are eligible for vaccination but who have not been immunized because of parents decisions

6567531 in march we were driving and saw a woman in her 20s step off the curb and get struck square by a pickup truck she was unconscious and it appeared shed suffered a massive brain injury
6567532 you could tell she saw the truck at the last moment because her cell phone was dropped right where she was struck just off the curb and she was thrown about 20 or 30 feet it was horrifying
6567533 interventions that have been created to encourage abstinence have treated abstinence and sexual activity as opposites however teenagers say they dont think of them as opposites
6567534 these abstinence only interventions are less likely to work than more comprehensive sex education programs because they are not meeting adolescents where they are and they are speaking a different language
6567535 this paper demonstrates that increasing abstinence intention does not lead to less sex in fact when abstinence intention and sex intention interact with each other a teenager is more likely to have sex
6567536 raise serious concerns about the abstinence only approach as a risk reduction method for adolescent sexual behavior
6567537 those primary strategic goals are the foundation for our actions in everything we do
6567538 what spectacular evidence of our efforts to conserve energy and be earth friendly
6567539 the decision to have a green roof is a major commitment to environmental sustainability
6567540 carolyn ringeisen and joan buckles had a grand vision of a fountain that can be seen from almost anywhere on campus and one that makes a big statement on the landscape
6567541 carolyn hopes the new fountain will attract more students and others to that whole area of the campus for social events and relaxation
6567542 where we are and where were going in the coming year
6567543 kids reject the bad taste of medicine because its basic biology their system is designed to reject that taste because many toxic substances are bitter and distasteful
6567544 our basic biology is telling us to reject bitter that its poison were really designed to reject this stuff
6567545 when it comes to many of the senses childhood is a time of heightened sensitivity the preference for sweet and salt starts shifting in adolescence
6567546 this is the first report to conclude that tobacco advertising and promotion increases tobacco use

6567554 50 and his attorneys met yesterday wednesday with suffolk county authorities regarding the fire that destroyed 50s house the meeting had been arranged weeks ago 50 is eager to review the findings of the investigation when it is concluded
6567555 if natos priorities move toward reckless support for the georgian president mikheil saakashvilis bankrupt regime and if the price they are ready to pay is to sever relations with russia this is not our choice
6567556 we are not planning to slam the door and they are also keeping the door open
6567557 everything depends on the priorities that nato chooses not on us
6567558 resonance technology like the mit demonstration requires a heavy infrastructure right now with coils of at least two feet to accomplish even a small distance
6567559 add to that a 35 percent loss in power this is not insignificant
6567560 you get a much greater idea of how people are feeling about things and im very fortunate to be in a situation i am and im working as hard as i can
6567561 the public is not asking you to perform miracles its just asking you to give us the straight story and then take action to ameliorate it and thats what were trying to do
6567562 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
6567563 the deposit could be one of the most important in south america in the last 60 years
6567564 we expect to use the robotic arm heavily over the next several weeks delivering samples to our instruments and examining trench floors and walls to continue to search for evidence of lateral and vertical variations in soil and ice structures
6567565 in his role with the national football league players association gene had the tremendous ability to get things done he was steadfast in his convictions but could always see the viewpoint of the other side he was a great contributor to both the nfl and the nflpa long after his hall of fame career as a player had concluded his many contributions will always be remembered his efforts have benefitted thousands of players privileged to play in the nfl over the past 25 years on behalf of the entire kansas city chiefs organization we will miss gene upshaw
6567566 i can remember we were sitting at the warrick hotel in 82 before the players went on strike out there in new york
6567567 here i am a rookie and im lining up for my first game against the chiefs and theres buck
6567568 he just sort of smiled at me he then proceeded to welcome me to pro football it was a long long afternoon for me
6567569 im not sure what they saw but we never took anything for granted against the chiefs
6567570 come on buck bobby bell willie lanier emmitt thomas johnny robinson lenny dawson otis taylor all those guys we had too much respect for those guys that sounds to me like one of hanks stram motivation ploys
6567571 deal with football players and you have a lot of different personalities deal with ownership and management and youve got a lot of different personalities he was able to walk among them all and get things done
6567572 he was a great visionary guy for the league and the players rights and benefits
6567573 he did a lot of things over his time that unified our union
6567574 its going to be a big loss no one is going to fill his shoes ill tell you that
6567575 gene upshaw for me theres a lot of things he did that i would like to duplicate
6567576 he played his career but he wasnt satisfied with just that he was on a mission and he took up the challenge of the players and he never looked back he changed so many things he forced the nfl owners to respect the players
6567577 his loss is something that will affect not only the players association but ownership management everyone connected with the national football league
6567578 he truly made an impact and he did it in a wonderful way
6567579 de mens is het enige wezen wat zijn eigen nest bevuild
6567580 ik spreek tot iedereen het is niet zozeer de vraag met wie ik spreek maar wie er naar mij luistert
6567581 christenen geloven dat slechts een handjevol mensen met god gecommuniceerd zou hebben
6567582 oh oh oh wat zijn we toch slecht we zijn al verdorven bij onze geboorte door een fout van onze eerste voorouders maar gelukkig is er redding er is genade voor ons zondaars als we oprecht geloven in het bestaan van de enige zoon van god de here jezus christus alleen via hem kunnen we tot god komen en als we dat doen zijn al onze zonden vergeven
6567583 vergeet het verhaal van adam en eva vergeet de tien geboden vergeet alles dat je is geleerd over een niet liefhebbende maar uiterst berekenende god want die god bestaat niet en heeft nooit bestaan echt niet
6567584 in terms of energy i couldnt keep up this morning wore me out and i didnt sleep this afternoon and i felt so tired
6567585 i think if i could have played this game tomorrow i could have done better
6567586 when i came onto the court and saw it was my backup paddle my heart almost stopped
6567587 we waited four years for this gold and a whole row of 10s was our crowning achievement
6567588 athens was our first olympics and your first gold is probably the high point of your entire life
6567589 these last four years it was harder to train because when you have that status it seems like there is nothing left to strive for but we were aware that we needed to prove ourselves again
6567590 it was a very serious competition the spanish girls especially were very very strong competitors
6567591 we knew no one was going to give us the gold medal on a silver plate
6567592 it was a long road to reach this olympic medal its been hard work
6567593 our goal was to do our maximum and we were near the russians so we reached our goal
6567594 the difficulty nowadays in this sport has to do with speed you have to be quicker and higher you see that with the anastasias theyre not only perfect in technical aspects
6567595 ik hou van jou als je ook van mij houdt
6567596 ik hou van mijn kinderen zolang ze naar de kerk gaan
6567597 hoe kon je dat nou doen je ziet toch hoeveel ik van jou hou
6567598 then i went to grab it and there was nothing
6567599 its kind of the way its been happening to me this olympics
6567600 the causes will have to be provided not only by the company but also by the black boxes which compile all the flight data
6567601 knowing the plane was bad it took off with my seven year old niece
6567602 sony and samsung launched what we termed fighter models because they were designed to reach new pricing lows
6567603 according to the law the airline must take responsibility as it brought in someone who is persona non grata
6567604 the first priority is that he must continue his journey to london as originally booked
6567605 god am i happy to be leaving vietnam and that jail i should never have been in there
6567606 i am not a professional psychologist but i am sure i can help people with my own experience as an ex victim of slavery i suffered a lot of domestic violence
6567607 i was forced to work for a man my former husband who treated me like a slave so i feel i know the subject maybe even more than many others and am ready to help people with all my heart
6567608 sometimes we artists actors and musicians are able to bring more public attention to a problem than officials or politicians we speak the language of emotions and feelings
6567609 the one thing we can say with some certainty is its the tip of the iceberg
6567610 he beat me up cut me with knives and there was sexual exploitation as well all kinds of bad things one day i was fed up and couldnt bear it any longer
6567611 i hope russia companies will take part in the bidding
6567612 lukoil is welcome to bid for the service contract at the second or third stage of the tender in march or september
6567613 we are currently reviewing their technical and economic terms but not their political component
6567614 at the moment we are not planning to increase our holdings we are also not planning a sharp exit because this is decent paper and it is bringing us decent earnings
6567615 a number of problems have built up we have to talk about the global economy and our economy
6567616 we have an agenda first of all the issue of taxation i mean tax reduction and better administration
6567617 we could also discuss the complicated i would call it a crisis situation on international financial markets which limits access of our companies to financial resources
6567618 perhaps we could talk about boosting lending inside the country to use part of the generated wealth
6567619 what is desperately needed now is a catalyst the only one that we can see at this point is a change in oil taxation
6567620 this is now crucial if we are to climb out of the current mess for one simple reason the market has significantly increased the risk premium on russian equities
6567621 only innocent people die when the pakistan army carries out airstrikes in bajaur or swat
6567622 if the army is really fond of fighting it should send ground forces to see how we fight
6567623 we have to devise a policy which is national which protects and serves our own interests
6567624 reaffirmed their mutual support for going after these extremists that are a threat to both pakistan the united states and the entire world
6567625 hypertrophied love of fame multiplied by hypertrophied vanity and a very unstable nervous system to put it mildly are not the best advisers for a president
6567626 the baltic sea festival is an event that is growing and thriving
6567627 when we began to outline our plans for this festival some years ago our basic assumption was that music could unite us this year we are presenting for the sixth time a festival that is attracting more and more people to a sense of community
6567628 originally the idea was of lots of musicians composers orchestras and choirs building bridges with the performers moving about freely
6567629 that would prove in both practical and symbolic terms that the baltic has now once again become an area that shares a common culture
6567630 the universal language of music has no political restrictions and can easily reach people across language barriers
6567631 i believe that a festival of this size can spark a shared desire to improve the deteriorating baltic sea environment
6567632 in 48 hours three ships have been attacked and hijacked by armed pirates it is coming to a very dangerous stage
6567633 we urge the united nations and the international community to take serious action to stop this menace
6567634 the idea of the event is simple we think that the freedom won in 1991 has been lost and victory stolen
6567635 so we want to remind everybody about those memorable events especially the new generation and most importantly to note that people went to the streets not for sausage as it is accepted to say now but were ready to sacrifice themselves for freedom
6567636 it was the time of hopes a noble reaction from people who rose above daily concerns and suddenly looked toward the sky and thought about such notions as freedom and justice
6567637 you cant compare what was then to the state of russian minds now
6567638 unfortunately a swamp like substance has filled the brains of russians again a free nation is what we need now after weve made this evolutionary circle from the communists to the communists we have come to the same model of the state that we had in the 1980s allegedly surrounded by enemies who didnt let us develop the roots of this disgrace lie of course in soviet ideology thats where our current rulers come from
6567639 as a person worried about russia i was shocked how easy it has become to brainwash our citizens with the media again i remember the soviet war in afghanistan very well when we were persuaded it was our international duty the rhetoric was absolutely identical once again they show american labels on georgian soldiers food and weapons
6567640 turning this corner can affect the future of russia and the world very badly
6567641 goodbye modernization goodbye democratization goodbye struggle with corruption long live the new mobilized thinking we are surrounded by enemies so we should arm ourselves defend ourselves and snarl around weve already been there this policy leads nowhere the regime has started to destroy itself rather furiously without looking back at its past experience
6567642 the small town of pyatigorsk reacted rather indifferently it even gloated over it i called musicians in st petersburg to find out details and tried to tune my radio to radio liberty to understand what was happening it was torture for me
6567643 its surprising that people rose up against tanks in such large numbers
6567644 such an increase in peoples consciousness would probably help take the situation in a better direction now thats what we need now history has come full circle and such events are waiting for us in the future i hope people will divert their attention from their meals cottages and cars and will recall at least what they were created for
6567645 but that was before the war if we had submitted the application just a day later then we wouldnt have got permission thats for sure
6567646 wed like to show that the environment is not something distant but rather close and concrete it doesnt belong somewhere out there but actually starts in your bathroom or kitchen wed like to make green topics fun
6567647 we wanted to have a festival that would bring people together and try to break down the borders that people have inside their heads
6567648 but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet
6567649 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6567650 ultimately the prime minister has to make the call on moving forward
6567651 a chance for me to meet with the prime minister and see what we can do from washington to get to closure
6567652 beautiful dusky maidens appeared to him in a swirling mist their arms swaying like willowy branches in the wind their tender faces concealed behind gauzy veils precious stones glittering in their delicate navels
6567653 would it be not better to hand us over to the un theyll pay ten times as much for us
6567654 perhaps he eats from plates of gold and drinks from vessels of silver but even were he to offer me a hundred times as much my intentions would remain unchanged
6567655 my prayer rises up into the vaults of this cell
6567656 and stays there it certainly doesnt reach god how am i supposed to know where he is who he is
6567657 god is what flows between your heart and its auricle like the tears that flow from under your eyelids he is everywhere
6567658 one givi is everything to him for you are the only givi that he has
6567659 a history of the world in 10 1 2 chapters
6567660 there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy because
6567661 everyone can recognise that the midfield is the strongest part of the scotland side
6567662 thats something im sure all the boys are thriving on and its a challenge for me to step up to the plate
6567663 it was not something i was expecting when i got out of bed on monday morning but i was delighted to receive the call
6567664 it was fairly steady nothing spectacular its been a number of years since i was last involved and i didnt want to do too much so i tried to keep it simple and gain a bit of confidence
6567665 there were a few tasty tackles and a bit of needle which is what you want northern ireland like scotland have improved in recent years and they gave us a good test
6567666 over the last few years ive had to come out reverse and start moving forward again
6567667 its not always been easy to keep my confidence up but days like these make you realise what all the hard work is for
6567668 which reminds me of another of ciceros witticisms that cato was always the perfect stoic as long as nothing went wrong
6567669 all of us in china have paid a lot to stage these olympics and tanning my skin brown is part of that effort
6567670 i dont think chinese audiences are that conservative anymore and their thinking about this kind of thing is already rather liberated
6567671 its quite normal to go to the beach and see most young women dressed this way
6567672 i feel extremely proud to be a chinese cheerleader and it is a special honor to perform with the spaniards in the international troupe
6567673 the chinese cheerleaders are all beautiful girls wearing fashionable bikinis and this is probably the first time theyve appeared in public in such highly revealing clothes
6567674 we used to watch bikini scenes in foreign movies now i can see that our women are very open and fashionable
6567675 people like that just dont exist anymore you dont replace a leslie whitt
6567676 to get a workstation running our software onto every desk and eventually in every home
6567677 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
6567678 what does the senators former status as a pow have to do with the number of houses he owns
6567679 they came over looking for it and they caught him redhanded
6567680 you took a life and now a mother has lost her first born
6567681 always had a smile on his face loved everybody thats brandon if there was something he could do to help you i just cant believe this is really going on
6567682 what has gone missing what is where and what kind of a state it is in
6567683 it is to wage war by sea land and air with all our might and with all the strength that god can give us to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark lamentable catalogue of human crime that is our policy

6567691 i think a lot of physicians are aware of lyme disease
6567692 a lot of physicians will treat them with antibiotics the problem gets into the patients who have chronic lyme disease or symptoms after lyme infection how do you treat those

6567807 we are pleased to welcome the swift and knight clean fleets into our growing pool of port of los angeles trucking concessionaires

6567811 it is modeled after similar service operating in the denver colorado area that has successfully maintained transit service to areas with lower population density much like this part of joliet
6567812 as the area has changed over the years some parts of town saw a significant drop in ridership
6567813 we analyzed these ridership patterns and have reallocated service from places with little or no demand to places that have higher potential
6567814 many of the routes operating in this area have experienced very few modifications over the past few decades but its clear to everyone that lives and works in these communities that extensive change has occurred
6567815 this is an opportunity for us to spend taxpayer money more effectively by reallocating our resources to areas with high demand which results in better service for our riders

6567821 the sultans often reserved part of this valuable commodity for their own usage and often sent it as part of presents for the caliph or for other rulers
6567822 obstinate in his infidelity and denial of allah so the sultan marched against him with his valiant warriors for the purpose of planting the standards of islam and extirpating idolatry the blood of the infidels flowed so copiously that the stream was discoloured and people were unable to drink it praise be to allah for the honour he bestows upon islam and musalmans
6567823 the sultan summoned the most religiously disposed of his followers and ordered them to attack the enemy immediately many infidels were consequently slain or taken prisoners in this sudden attack and the musalmans paid no regard to the booty till they had satiated themselves with the slaughter of the infidels the friends of allah searched the bodies of the slain for three whole days in order to obtain booty

6567829 in order to repair the fortunes of his servants and armies for within the last few years khurasan on account of the disasters it had sustained yielded neither men nor money when he arrived in hind god gave him such a victory that his treasures were replenished and his armies renewed
6567830 neither eat nor drink nor change garments till he had avenged himself
6567831 it was the hindu practice to prepare for the pitched battle by waking at 3 oclock in the morning performing the morning wash and worship eating the cooked food pakwan kept ready before hand putting on arms and marching out to their appointed places in the line of battle before sunrise but in the second battle of naraina also called tarain taraori the rajputs could take no breakfast they had to snatch up their arms and form their lines as best as they could in a hurry and fought the turko afghan army from 9 oclock in the morning to 3 oclock in the afternoon at the end of which the hindus were utterly exhausted from the fighting hunger and thirst
6567832 those of the horizon who were wise and acute were converted to islam but those who stood by their ancestoral faith were slain with the sword 20 000 prisoners were taken and made slaves
6567833 the slaughter of hindus at varanasi was immense none were spared except women and children who were taken into slavery and the carnage of men went on until the earth was weary

6567947 the question i ask now is can you show me that you can afford a 1 900 a month payment or whatever it might be because if you cant show me that theres nothing i can do about it the reality is that not everyone can be helped i do turn people away
6567948 you live and learn they didnt really understand what it was

6567962 a viewer is permitted and even encouraged to ogle an ongoing parade of muscled and lithe and rippling and toned and occasionally highly perplexing bodies wearing little more than the evidence of our mutating cultural ideals
6567963 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
6567964 we expect the home office to provide us at the information commissioners office with a copy of the internal investigation report and its findings
6567965 we will then decide what further action may be appropriate searching questions must be answered about what safeguards were in place to protect this information
6567966 what is more scandalous is that it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data rendering them unfit to be charged with protecting our safety

6567975 the alpha flying inc planesense program remains a rapidly growing and viable aircraft fractional ownership program with 33 pilatus pc 12 aircraft currently under fractional management with many more on order to support continuing expansion whether or not the grob spn aircraft is brought to certification and production
6567976 the planesense program which allows individuals and companies to purchase shares of aircraft to fit their needs and budgets continues to have confidence that grob will resolve its current difficulties as many aircraft manufacturers have done in similar stages of aircraft development
6567977 if grob should not be able to resolve its current insolvency then there are other options available for the acquisition of turbojet aircraft for the planesense program
6567978 amd is aware that interested third parties including major media organizations have filed a motion with the court seeking to unseal various documents that the parties to the amd v intel u s antitrust suit filed under the protective order in that case amd does not oppose the motion
6567979 indicating that we would like to cooperate with their requirements
6567980 however it is a very complex matter with more parties than intel and amd involved including scores of third parties we thought it would be reasonable to sit down and talk to them about it
6567981 we believe that intel needs to make a serious effort to review its documents and limit its redactions to those which are absolutely necessary which we do not believe they have done so far
6567982 gene revolution with over 100 million of seed money since the 1970s cgiar the global network created by the rockefeller foundation to promote its ideal of genetic purity through agriculture change

6567984 i m a work in progress i d never been to church until
6567985 i question your credibility because you talk shit and you lack the intellectual integrity to acknowledge what you must presumably know are reasonable points since you are paid to read think and lecture
6567986 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
6567987 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
6567988 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
6567989 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
6567990 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
6567991 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
6567992 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
6567993 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
6567994 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
6567995 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
6567996 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
6567997 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
6567998 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
6567999 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
6568000 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
6568001 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
6568002 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
6568003 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
6568004 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
6568005 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
6568006 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
6568007 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
6568008 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
6568009 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
6568010 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
6568011 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
6568012 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
6568013 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
6568014 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
6568015 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
6568016 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
6568017 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
6568018 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
6568019 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness
6568020 our goal is to get the iphone client out as quickly as possible because it does represent a significant percentage of the devices touching our network
6568021 the apple guys are really smart and they have a beautiful phone
6568022 the walls shook a little bit as i first cruised in but jesus and
6568023 the quest is quite brilliant and that is all there is to it
6568024 i know you cant tell but they actually do im a real redhead from the hair on my head to the pubes on my pussy but since its bikini season i shaved them all off after this barbeque im gonna skinny dip in the pool so i wanted my slit to be nice and smooth not only does it look pretty shaved but it feels awesome when the cold water touches my bare lips
6568025 who cares i want to get naked if they talk crap about me its just cause theyre jealous most of the people here know i can be a little wild anyway im an exhibitionist and half of my friends have seen me naked some people think thats slutty of me but i think they secretly wish they could be as comfortable in their skin as i am in mine i look good and i enjoy being naked so why not and my pussy needs some room to breathe too it gets suffocated from being trapped in my tight little panties all day long
6568026 they promised us work every day and that we were going to earn 100 a day
6568027 they pandora are not right now in the business of selling advertising if they were theyd actually have ads in the streams but they say thats what makes over the air radio bad
6568028 he accepts that online radio stations play better more varied music than their over the air counterparts but wants them to adopt a similar audio ad laced format in order to pay soundexchange what he says it deserves
6568029 let me congratulate you on a job well done this game is so immersive its like being addicted to crack cocaine but like crack cocaine its affecting my real life in negative ways kudos to the developers later

6568032 she supported a huge tax increase when she was a city council member in the early nineties and she refuses to fight wasteful spending today as a congressional candidate susan bitter smith can call herself a conservative but when voters look at her record they will see just how liberal she truly is

6568034 thats the base of the party theres no reason for mccain to tear the scabs off the wounds
6568035 russia will take steps aimed at ensuring its interests along its borders

6568038 club swinging involves the competitor standing erect with a club in each hand unlike juggling the clubs do not leave the hands the clubs look like bowling pins or juggling clubs and are whirled or swung very quickly around the body and head in a variety of patterns in a complicated routine
6568039 doesnt mean it has been done with that version of dtc 44 pm
6568040 the evidence is overwhelming that there is a specialized system dedicated to processing faces and not other objects
6568041 why we are so good at recognizing and remembering faces
6568042 a brief glance at a face conveys a wealth of information about identity expression gender age mood intent attractiveness social states and even honesty
6568043 the ability to extract this information within a fraction of a second of viewing a face is important for normal social interaction and has probably played a critical role in the survival of our primate ancestors
6568044 are completely baffled why robbers cover their faces in movies
6568045 its like viewing grains of sugar rather than the whole cube
6568046 a region could serve more than one function said scott huettel a professor of psychiatry at duke university in durham n c
6568047 just by looking at an fmri we can tell if a subject is looking at faces or places
6568048 there was a recognition in the primaries that we spent a little too much time doing the big rallies
6568049 people think obamas fame or the fact they know him from a speech or a book is his totality and its not
6568050 cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them
6568051 theres still a mystery element to this guy and the opposition so far has done a good job of defining him
6568052 the partys candidates tend to have an intellectual way of expressing their views
6568053 that gets portrayed as effete and elitist people like simplicity
6568054 theres a little bit of kerry in obama in that he seems aloof and not as engaged as mccain
6568055 you cant come out and say im uncomfortable with a black man as president but its entirely possible that theres a segment of the population that feels that way
6568056 is code for the n word if hes a white guy no ones saying hes elitist hes doing what everybody else is doing
6568057 hes just not my kind of candidate certainly some of it is inexperience but some is attitude
6568058 i get a pompous vibe from him and i dont like that
6568059 i dont know that he can it may be part and parcel of him
6568060 obama needs to offer as many specifics as possible talk about home foreclosures for instance or health care
6568061 one of our biggest battle tools is that barack obama and john mccain have completely different approaches to energy the economy foreign policy
6568062 obama needs to show how hes something different and mccain is more of the same
6568063 i want new ideas i want to hear about a new way of doing business
6568064 obama team to hold major event saturday in bayhs indiana campaign team gathering for possible veep announcement
6568065 obama says hes chosen his vp wont reveal who it is yet
6568066 despite no major veep news emerging overnight it hasnt stopped the speculation from growing get details and all your 24 7 political news on the page
6568067 as vp speculation swirls politico takes you inside the discussions will it be kaine whose staff met with obama
6568068 kaine answered he visited with my staff just to basically say hi and thank them for all their hard work
6568069 it used to be you needed two sources now you hear people repeating what some people say we dont know if theyre just repeating what they heard from someone in an elevator
6568070 lots of people love politics as a game and journalists are way into the game
6568071 the new york times newsroom was buzzing after obama beat reporter jeff zeleny learned that the dem hopeful has now finalized his choice for a running mate
6568072 cbs news has confirmed that barack obamas campaign now plans to announce obamas vice presidential choice to supporters via e mail and text message on friday afternoon

6568074 anticancer research is aimed at understanding the molecular pathways that can be selectively targeted to halt tumor growth
6568075 we know that the mtor pathway is activated in many cancers and therefore is a good target for fighting a wide array of tumors
6568076 we analyzed tissue from human biopsies as well as cancer cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models of cancer
6568077 need to remain in town to do our business and should not attend
6568078 i will not be in denver for seven days thats for sure
6568079 yeah we had her last week but we decided not to tell anyone
6568080 oh shit you mean thats what that thing is on the bathroom floor
6568081 yes my wife gave birth last night im exhausted but i couldnt wait to take a shower and get to work on time while i left them in the hospital
6568082 yep had the baby but i thought id hang out on im for a while to see if anyone asked before we announced it
6568083 yeah i totally popped the kid out shes sitting right here on the couch next to me i figured once i was done blogging wed head on over to the hospital and see what they can do about this cord thingy
6568084 necessary step in our process to emerge from bankruptcy as a stronger company better positioned to compete in the retail industry

6568087 the hullabaloo began in june when the fda approved gardasil a vaccine widely described as 100 percent effective in preventing cervical cancer a disease that kills some 233 000 women worldwide each year
6568088 its worth asking a few questions why does the vaccine cost 360 for a three shot regimen how much do we know about the new product and is this a cost effective use of health care dollars
6568089 only two strains of hpv human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer and those two account for just 70 percent of all cases
6568090 mandatory vaccination across the u s would make an automatic blockbuster for merck at a time when the patents on some of its bestselling drugs are expiring and its desperate to replace their revenue streams
6568091 you can have hpv and not even know it says another professional actress
6568092 a growing number of parents are worried about exposing their children to the unforeseen side effects of a new vaccine to protect them from a disease that is no longer very common in the u s adding to some parents concern 82 adverse events among both teens and adult women have been reported since gardasil became available last june
6568093 those deaths cannot and should not be ignored but most could have been saved by regular pap smears according to a study published in the new england journal of medicine
6568094 more than half of all cases occurred in women who had never or rarely
6568095 wouldnt it be cheaper and safer to set up a government program that ensures that all girls and women are screened regularly while the vaccine protects against just 70 percent of all cervical cancers pap smears detect 90 to 95 percent
6568096 if we had true universal screening as in some scandinavian countries we probably wouldnt need both the vaccine and screening
6568097 118 to 120 million women in the 11 to 26 age range in the u s the eu and other high income countries
6568098 women who are vaccinated will perceive themselves to be at low risk for developing cancer and as a result will not participate in screening as recommended
6568099 now this is one cancer i dont have to worry about fighting
6568100 in two years cervical cancer has gone from obscure killer confined mostly to poor nations to the wests disease of the moment
6568101 the evidence gap drugmakers push leads to cancer vaccines rise
6568102 tens of millions of girls in the u s and europe
6568103 the lightning fast transition from newly minted vaccine to must have injection in the united states and europe represents a triumph of what the manufacturers call education and their critics call marketing
6568104 award winning advertising has promoted the vaccine before the film sex and the city some moviegoers in the united states saw ads for gardasil on youtube and in advertisements on popular shows like law and order a multiethnic cast of young professionals urges girls to become one less statistic by getting vaccinated
6568105 meanwhile it is far more expensive than earlier vaccines against other diseases gardasils list price is 360 for the three dose series and the total cost is typically 400 to nearly 1 000 but with their high price the vaccines are straining national and state health budgets as well as family pocketbooks
6568106 these were the first vaccines approved for universal use in any age group that clearly cost the health system money rather than saved it
6568107 countries that pay for the vaccines will have less money available for other health needs
6568108 this kind of money could be better used to solve so many other problems in womens health
6568109 some experts are concerned about possible side effects that become apparent only after a vaccine has been more widely tested over longer periods
6568110 worry about the consequences of the rapid rollout of the new vaccines without more medical evidence they say that because of the aggressive marketing even parents of girls who are far from being sexually active may feel pressured into giving them a vaccine that is not yet needed and whose
6568111 this big push is making people crazy thinking theyre bad moms if they dont get their kids vaccinated
6568112 and why the sudden alarm in developed countries about cervical cancer
6568113 a major killer in the developing world particularly africa where the vaccines are too expensive for use cervical cancer is classified as very rare in the west because it is almost always preventable through regular pap smears which detect precancerous cells early enough for effective treatment
6568114 i would have liked to see it go much slower
6568115 most vaccines take three years to get that sort of endorsement
6568116 in that time you learn a lot about safety and side effects and how to use it
6568117 many bills like ones passed in colorado new jersey and new york allocate more money for hpv and cervical cancer education or to promote the vaccine others like proposals in iowa and louisiana require insurers to cover it
6568118 in december 2006 merck announced it would invest 57 million to expand its elkton va plant to make gardasil helped by a 700 000 grant from a state economic development agency that is part of the executive branch two months later gov tim kaine who has been mentioned as a possible democratic vice presidential candidate signed legislation requiring gardasil for schoolgirls four months after that merck pledged to invest 193 million more in the plant to make drugs and vaccines helped by a state grant of 1 5 million
6568119 the immunity of gardasil will not last that is dangerous to assume
6568120 it is with huge regret and disappointment that we have been forced to cancel our imminent european festival appearances at leeds reading 2 days a week area 4 as well as exclusive performances for mtv europe and virgin tv

6568129 this is the first report to conclude that tobacco advertising and promotion increases tobacco use
6568130 its the first report to make the conclusion that there is a causal relationship between exposure to depiction of smoking in the movies and youth beginning to smoke
6568131 cigarettes are one of the most heavily marketed products in the united states
6568132 now it is up to the government to consider the evidence and think about what it needs to do in terms of advertising and promotion
6568133 this report sends an unmistakable message to our elected officials that they can dramatically reduce tobacco use by children and by adults by passing legislation that would authorize the food and drug administration to regulate tobacco products and by adequately funding their state prevention and cessation programs
6568134 it appears that many of the conclusions in the report are based on marketing practices that are more than 30 or 40 years old
6568135 we think its important to focus on the marketing practices that we have in place today

6568145 i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market her album sales are not nearly as close to her single sales and he knows that if she is only known as a singles artist she will only be as good as her last hit unfortunately he didnt inform his client and im receiving the brunt of it
6568146 her record label def jam has put out 3 albums in a time span of 2 years alot of that was orchestrated through her management rebel one it was never def jams intention to release so many albums back to back but marc jordan found loop holes and ways to make it happen a lot of the money rihanna made through her endorsements between covergirl cosmetics samsung notice that majority of rihannas videos have a cell phone in it
6568147 after the release of rihanna and teairra mari def jam had intention to drop both acts because their album sales were not successful
6568148 then came for the repackaging of her album good girl gone bad which is called good girl gone bad reloaded that entire project was funded through rihannas money take a bow was bought through her money the video was created with her money and so is her most recent video and single disturbia the label didnt even want to pay a dime for anything close to 750 000 was spent on those two songs alone and now she expects to see money in her account
6568149 are arriving in emergency departments with serious and sometimes fatal injuries because they were not paying attention while texting
6568150 people are texting and they trip and fall on their faces usually people in their 20s we see a lot of face chin mouth and eye injuries from falls
6568151 some people are actually on chicagos busy lakefront path texting while walking or exercising we see people rollerblading or biking while texting they are usually very skilled but sometimes crash and fall when they are not watching where they are going
6568152 in march we were driving and saw a woman in her 20s step off the curb and get struck square by a pickup truck she was unconscious and it appeared shed suffered a massive brain injury
6568153 you could tell she saw the truck at the last moment because her cell phone was dropped right where she was struck just off the curb and she was thrown about 20 or 30 feet it was horrifying
6568154 one of the most common behavioral changes cancer survivors make sometimes without a doctors advice often on their own is using dietary supplements in hopes of bolstering their health
6568155 still its unclear whether supplements really help keep cancer survivors healthier or put them at further risk they like many other people today use the internet and you can find a lot of false hope out there with supplements targeted at cancer survivors
6568156 in our study we see people taking supplements who have good diets and who are relatively healthy while they may need a particular vitamin because they dont get enough of it they may not need a multivitamin or supplement because of the increased risk of cancer recurrence or secondary cancer
6568157 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6568158 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6568159 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6568160 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6568161 theres a lack of well paying jobs in the area
6568162 when folks have a chance to move on they move on
6568163 teachers pay more attention to people messing around than people who want to learn
6568164 the only way to make money is selling dope on the corner
6568165 it gives a really powerful message that if youre not in school were going to your home
6568166 most of the time we find dropouts not working and not happy with life
6568167 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6568168 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6568169 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6568170 mai tai with rhum coconut red curry and wok crispy boniato
6568171 sadly everything learned at this conference reinforces the view that canadas whistleblower laws are merely a smokescreen designed to give the impression that something good is being done while offering little assistance or protection to honest public servants who so badly need it
6568172 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6568173 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6568174 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6568175 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6568176 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6568177 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6568178 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6568179 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6568180 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6568181 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6568182 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta

6568184 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6568185 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6568186 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6568187 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6568188 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6568189 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6568190 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6568191 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6568192 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6568193 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6568194 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6568195 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6568196 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6568197 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6568198 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6568199 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6568200 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6568201 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6568202 stim ca in america doar cei familiarizati cu tehnologia pot face asa cumparaturile adevarul este ca in alte tari a devenit deja o parte a culturii aceasta este tendinta iar pentru noi in calitate de casa de moda este foarte important sa identificam tendintele si chiar sa fim cu un pas inaintea lor
6568203 tinta noastra sunt persoanele care sunt interesate de brandul nostru si de tehnologie indiferent de proportia acestor interese
6568204 at first glance its hard to imagine two more biologically distinct groups of people burying their dead in the same place
6568205 the biggest mystery is how they seemed to have done this without disturbing a single grave
6568206 everywhere you turned there were bones belonging to animals that dont live in the desert sereno said
6568207 its reassuring to know that the other michael derr in akron is not an insufferable ass
6568208 gene was great leader for us and someone ive gotten to know the past few years
6568209 im very shocked its just a real shocked moment obviously i feel bad for his wife terri and his sons i cant imagine what his family is going through
6568210 i heard when i was on the way to work this morning
6568211 very surprised obviously gene was a guy i played against and knew for a long time since 1977 actually i thought he did a tremendous job with the union and was a great player and did a great job in that capacity
6568212 you hate to see that happen its a very very tough day
6568213 any player who has touched our game in the past 20 years has been positively influenced by his leadership
6568214 whether it be raising the salary minimums for rookies for veterans for retired players you name it
6568215 you continue to look back over the past 20 years and hes done nothing but improve our game from the players perspective everybody can sit back and some people might criticize certain things he has done but overall i dont think you could have asked for a better leader for the past 20 years
6568216 i was shocked and saddened to hear today of genes passing
6568217 for those of us who worked with him through the years gene will be remembered as a man of integrity who respected and loved the game his contributions on behalf of nfl players and to the nfl were among the greatest in the history of sports in this country
6568218 he will be missed by everyone in the nfl but most of all by those of us who had the pleasure of knowing him
6568219 screening levels are set very low to ensure that they are health protective
6568220 they found that even if a worker was on site over a 25 year working lifetime the concentrations of lead and arsenic were low enough that no adverse health effects would be expected
6568221 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6568222 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6568223 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6568224 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6568225 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6568226 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6568227 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6568228 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6568229 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6568230 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6568231 and you still go every morning even though she doesnt know who you are
6568232 she doesnt know me but i still know who she is
6568233 that is the kind of love i want in my life
6568234 only innocent people die when the pakistan army carries out airstrikes in bajaur or swat
6568235 if the army is really fond of fighting it should send ground forces to see how we fight
6568236 we have to devise a policy which is national which protects and serves our own interests
6568237 reaffirmed their mutual support for going after these extremists that are a threat to both pakistan the united states and the entire world
6568238 only innocent people die when the pakistan army carries out airstrikes in bajaur or swat
6568239 if the army is really fond of fighting it should send ground forces to see how we fight
6568240 we have to devise a policy which is national which protects and serves our own interests
6568241 reaffirmed their mutual support for going after these extremists that are a threat to both pakistan the united states and the entire world
6568242 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6568243 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6568244 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6568245 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6568246 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6568247 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6568248 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6568249 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6568250 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6568251 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6568252 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6568253 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6568254 im going to let the campaign speak for the campaign
6568255 nosotros estuvimos en barajas justo antes de que partiera ese avi n as que sabemos todo lo que est n sufriendo y nos unimos a ellos es un d a muy triste ha sucedido algo horrible

6568257 we know that we have to win to make our owners management and fans happy
6568258 that is something that we have to turn the corner on and get back on track with is winning
6568259 i went to the world championships for 23 days and skated 21 of those days
6568260 getting out there skating and not having so long to think about next year made it easier
6568261 its going to be even tougher than it has been in years past
6568262 we have to go out and focus on our goal and that is to be first or somewhere in the top to get home ice advantage
6568263 nuestro pa s hizo la solicitud y ya fue aprobada por los parlamentos de argentina y uruguay en brasil fue aprobada por las tres comisiones parlamentarias competentes s lo falta la aprobaci n de la c mara de diputados y del senado mientras que en paraguay el caso ya est bastante adelantado

6568265 i dont have any pain really ive just got a bloody nose and obviously the swelling beyond that i feel fine pain wise
6568266 i can see out of my right eye when i open it its just easier right now to keep it closed
6568267 but the way they made it sound with the fractures is that nothing is out of place when the swelling goes does they think i can just let it heal and go from there
6568268 i tried to pull back and get out of the way i saw the ball and it was about a foot away and i closed my eye and said oh oh then it hit me
6568269 had i not been squared to bunt i think i could have protected myself a little better since i was squared i was more exposed its just one of those things that happened
6568270 shed be worse if i was in pain i really havent been in a whole lot of pain its been more a case that i cant see out of my right eye my nose has been constantly bleeding since it happened
6568271 i dont have any pain really ive just got a bloody nose and obviously the swelling beyond that i feel fine pain wise
6568272 i can see out of my right eye when i open it its just easier right now to keep it closed
6568273 but the way they made it sound with the fractures is that nothing is out of place when the swelling goes does they think i can just let it heal and go from there

6568276 shed be worse if i was in pain i really havent been in a whole lot of pain its been more a case that i cant see out of my right eye my nose has been constantly bleeding since it happened
6568277 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6568278 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6568279 hes excited about playing for new coach rick carlisle rick made a great impression on him and came to visit him a couple of times

6568282 when you play in the national tournaments you have to feel you belong in this club
6568283 being 52 years old and being from the west its sometimes difficult to feel your part of it
6568284 i think i showed i can compete at this level
6568285 its just the greatest thing its something i thought about in my working life but never was able to take the time to get my game in shape thank goodness i got it just good enough in shape this time around now i need to start realizing i can play at this level even at 52
6568286 i get excited about playing and i think my game travels a lot better now especially after playing in the u s senior open last year and the british senior this year but ive also realized its just golf just a game
6568287 this u s amateur is a good springboard for that

6568293 most people if they ingest listeria bacterium their gut immunity their status is good enough that it really doesnt cause any illness and it passes through
6568294 thats why the warning is more to those that are susceptible thats the elderly the young under the age of one and pregnant women
6568295 most people either have no symptoms or may have sort of a mild you know food poisoning type picture in rare cases when you get a lot of the bacteria it can leave the intestinal tract invade the body cause an inflection in the blood but it can also cause meningitis that tends to be only the people who are more vulnerable
6568296 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6568297 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6568298 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6568299 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6568300 in an attempt to make something stick barack obama has re aired his dirty laundry with convicted felon tony rezko that led to a highly questionable land deal rezkos dirty dealings are well documented and his relationship with barack obama goes back 20 years

6568321 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6568322 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6568323 but by the same token we know these very same people are not interested in less religiosity in the political discourse they almost universally want a religious person as president
6568324 its not that they want to take religion out of politics its that their frustrations with the way things seem to be going are leading them to say well maybe churches should back off on this
6568325 i do not like to hear men make excuses although it is natural and i put up with it i wish they could see and understand that they have had advantages above many of their brethren that they have been greatly blessed and should never complain but should stand up here and exercise themselves according to the best of their ability and do all the good possible for them to do
6568326 we will continue to look into pfeifers past to see if any other incidents of assault on children have taken place

6568360 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6568361 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6568362 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6568363 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6568364 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6568365 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6568366 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6568367 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6568368 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6568369 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6568370 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos

6568375 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6568376 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6568377 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6568378 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6568379 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6568380 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6568381 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6568382 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6568383 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6568384 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6568385 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6568386 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6568387 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6568388 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6568389 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6568390 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6568391 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6568392 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6568393 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6568394 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas
6568395 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
6568396 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6568397 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6568398 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6568399 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6568400 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6568401 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6568402 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6568403 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6568404 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6568405 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6568406 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6568407 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6568408 its just like an acoustic instrument but in addition to that each key on the right hand piano keyboard is a switch which sends a signal to microprocessor and a sound generator and then i can select whether i would like that to sound a like a saxophone or a trumpet or the violin section of an orchestra
6568409 these days i look for something that i havent learned about a genre of music that maybe im not familiar with but that would be interesting or challenging to play on the accordion
6568410 you have to have several different musical grooves going on at the same time
6568411 opens eyes a little bit to what people can expect from the accordion
6568412 four out of five nights of the week i would fall asleep with the lights on my book open and arms sprawled out with the highlighter in my hand
6568413 as an elected official it was good to learn from an administrative perspective i can now take the time to step back and see if something is a technical or a systematic issue
6568414 not everything has to be solved immediately sometimes making a decision quickly really depends on the circumstances sometimes government can be too slow but a rush to judgment isnt good either
6568415 cortadas con la misma tijera con la que se elabor la reforma constitucional rechazada por los venezolanos y dijo que el tribunal supremo de justicia no resolver la derogatoria de dichas leyes
6568416 por qu eliminar al plan rep blica del proceso y poner al brazo armado del psuv a cuidar los votos
6568417 esos candidatos vienen de ser funcionarios y ministros no son l deres comunitarios lo nico que les falta es incluir la reelecci n indefinida en las leyes
6568418 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6568419 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6568420 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6568421 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6568422 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6568423 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6568424 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6568425 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6568426 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6568427 the only radio host that can describe jamie romak as a three true outcomes hitter and know what it means
6568428 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6568429 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6568430 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6568431 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6568432 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6568433 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

6568435 new book out and making the move to open access
6568436 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
6568437 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
6568438 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
6568439 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
6568440 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
6568441 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
6568442 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
6568443 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
6568444 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
6568445 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
6568446 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6568447 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6568448 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6568449 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6568454 all this was a big joke it got into something way bigger than it was supposed to be
6568455 it started off as some youtube videos and a web site were all about having fun
6568456 so a defense attorney now could say how do we know youre not lying now
6568457 requested an undisclosed sum of money as an advance expected from the marketing and promotion

6568459 we havent been out since tuesday because of the bad driving
6568460 it was hard to see because of all of the rain but we have plenty of canned food

6568462 im up here im not unfortunate i can cook a hamburger ive got power i feel very blessed
6568463 ive lived here 43 years and ive never seen anything like it
6568464 wreckage was strewn for about a mile down the beach
6568465 we dont live in a flood zone but it just came in and came in and came in
6568466 collapsed when she suffered a very serious brain hemorrhage caused by an aneurysm that burst in an inaccessible part of her brain
6568467 we need to have this country defended and we need new people trained we need new equipment and we will work very closely with u s to get all of this
6568468 we talked about this date a week ago and russia sticks to its commitments in terms of deadlines
6568469 we have taken all this equipment to a certain place and are guarding it
6568470 i dont know what the fate of these hummers will be we dont have time to think of such little details
6568471 well think what to do with it its not our priority right now to give back vehicles to the u s
6568472 saakashvili bears responsibility for how the situation will develop in the future
6568473 i offer my enormous thanks to the russian federation and the russian people and the russian soldiers who we have to thank for our freedom
6568474 the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery
6568475 when this critical column buckled due to lack of floor supports it was the first domino in the chain
6568476 hopefully this thorough report puts to rest the various 9 11 conspiracy theories which dishonor the men and women who lost their lives on that terrible day
6568477 the public should really recognize the science is really behind what we have said
6568478 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6568479 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6568480 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6568481 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6568482 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6568483 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6568484 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6568485 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6568486 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6568487 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6568488 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6568489 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6568490 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6568491 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6568492 thank god for intelligent women like alexis otherwise the rest of you would be fucked
6568493 o grupo de exterm nio composto por 17 milicianos utilizou uma l gica pol tica para favorecer a campanha da candidata a vereadora carminha jerominho do ptdob e irm de luciano
6568494 esse atentado teve como objetivo principal criar a id ia na comunidade de que a presen a de milicianos imprescind vel e alguns candidatos vinculados ao grupo de milicianos deveriam ser prestigiados pela comunidade no sentido de eleger essas pessoas para que a mil cia permanecesse na comunidade trabalhamos com todas as possibilidades entre elas a da carminha jerominho ptdob ser uma dessas refer ncias
6568495 a a o dos milicianos na favela do barbante foi uma tentativa de desespero do grupo para retomar o poder

6568507 despite widespread acknowledgement that obesity is endangering the health of millions of americans the country is still failing to respond clearly or comprehensively
6568508 we must work together governments schools and communities to improve nutrition and increase physical activity for all ages we must ensure that strong policies are implemented and enforced in every state not only to help reverse existing obesity rates but to prevent obesity among our nations children and generations to come
6568509 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6568510 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6568511 i dont give a sh t about their rights i just wanna see some t ts
6568512 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6568513 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6568514 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6568515 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6568516 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6568517 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6568518 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6568519 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6568520 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6568521 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6568522 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6568523 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6568524 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6568525 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6568526 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6568527 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6568528 this is a very serious threat to the pocketbooks of the people of new orleans my job is to protect the interests of new orleans ratepayers their job is to protect the interests of entergy stockholders this is one of those times where those two interests are colliding head on

6568546 as host plans well provide our medical care provider networks and our discounts continue to reimburse providers and continue to determine claims pricing

6568550 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6568551 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply

6568558 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6568559 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6568560 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6568561 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6568562 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6568578 when children return to school the stress on every family member can be huge including the family dog

6568581 what we expected to find is that the migration to ipv6 is slow
6568582 i dont think youd find anyone that expected there to be a significant ramp up in ipv6 usage what was surprising in what we found is that there is no migration
6568583 we saw a flat proportion of ipv4 to ipv6 over the course of the year
6568584 so although in aggregate ipv6 did grow its growing at about the same level that general internet traffic is growing
6568585 we see press releases from lots of providers across the world talking about ipv6 readiness or infrastructure deployed and im sure its all true it just doesnt seem like anyone is using it
6568586 we have some monitoring in asia but we would like to see more there obviously iekel johnson admitted
6568587 its not quite as comprehensive as the european and north american measurements
6568588 in general we agree with the findings of the report issued today
6568589 it seems comprehensive and we appreciate the value of these types of studies as they help raise awareness and understanding of critical industry issues
6568590 we see press releases from lots of providers across the world talking about ipv6 readiness or infrastructure deployed and im sure its all true it just doesnt seem like anyone is using it

6568620 you cant go outside and wear your spiderman suit because its one hundred and twelve frickin degrees outside
6568621 its condominiums where ill have them get to you he said before quitting the campaign trail for three days to strategise with top aides as both the candidates finalise their choice of running mate
6568622 now think about that i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make us5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong he said
6568623 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their house you might have a different perspective
6568624 so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6568625 we cant afford eight more years or four more years or one more year of the same failed economic policies that president george bush has put in place senator obama said

6568652 what if the supernatural is not something fanciful unseen and spooky existing only beyond or outside the so called natural completely unknown in its totality
6568653 furthermore what if such a reality that we call the natural and which fallible human convention arbitrarily limits actually defies the limits superficially imposed by such fallible human convention
6568654 what if in addition the supernatural has been here all along unknown and empirically unconfirmed until now and the natural turns out to be ironically not as natural as has been supposed by present human convention but supernatural at its core and overall essence
6568655 if the supernatural is not part of reality how can we know it exists or not and what would it matter to us if it did

6568722 i suppose i could but ive never heard of this before
6568723 you think i made this up just to call and ruin your day

6568730 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6568731 shortly after joining the u s senate and while enjoying a surge in income barack obama bought a 1 65 million restored georgian mansion in an upscale chicago neighborhood to finance the purchase he secured a 1 32 million loan from northern trust in illinois the freshman democratic senator received a discount he locked in an interest rate of 5 625 percent on the 30 year fixed rate mortgage below the average for such loans at the time in chicago

6568736 where does that link come from i pondered obviously the last part is some sort of asset id like each avatar has the equivalent of a textures database id i poked around urls at world secondlife com many of which return xml data and my hunch is the search engine that you use in world is xml based so i went in to second life poked around my profile all of the bizarre advanced settings looking for this magical string that might identify cdb barkley via url
6568737 in terms of the physical safety and future of my wife and two sons let alone the country i would much prefer four more years of the bush presidency to a mccain presidency
6568738 bo we picked this day because we know its your date night with your wife just this once please speak to our group
6568739 is this me is this my life gosh im filled with so much joy
6568740 i dont know what our government does period i reality is my drug
6568741 i just realized from my own knowledge that some o a lot for too little
6568742 we have been sort of like john mccain but not co republicans enjoy nice nice even a little foot in mouth by huckabee no matter iowa caucus
6568743 if you had to make the toughest decision of your life
6568744 hallmark is jeopardizing its brand as a family friendly company customers used to be able to trust hallmark to produce quality products that were safe for all ages now parents will need to steer their kids from hallmarks section of the greeting card aisle and away from its previously heartwarming movies for fear that they too will push homosexual messages
6568745 i would have found onstott guilty of premeditated first degree murder based on the phone conversations
6568746 escribir es plantar una semilla y tarde o temprano germina
6568747 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6568748 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6568749 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6568750 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6568751 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6568752 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6568753 res en aquesta declaraci no podr interpretar se en el sentit que doni cap dret a un estat a un grup o a una persona a emprendre activitats o a realitzar actes que tendeixin a la supressi de qualsevol dels drets i llibertats que shi enuncien
6568754 who will be the new vice president whoever you want thats who
6568755 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore
6568756 the nato declaration above all appears unobjective and biased because theres not a word about how all this started why it happened who started the aggressive action and who armed georgia
6568757 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defense
6568758 the behaviour of russia in this most recent conflict is isolating russia from the principles of co operation among nations
6568759 when you start invading smaller neighbours bombing civilian infrastructure going into villages and wreaking havoc and carrying out the wanton destruction of its infrastructure that is isolating
6568760 and thus a nation of loud and proud rednecks was born
6568761 ive been raising money to help pay for the trip and what i keep telling people is that this is going to be a life changing experience for me
6568762 theres something to be said that a black candidate is going to be the nominee for the party on the anniversary of the i have a dream speech its just a great feeling to be a part of such a significant event
6568763 we went door to door a lot and would get them slammed in our faces or have insults yelled at us
6568764 but then youd get that one person who was willing to listen and you would explain what you wanted to say and get your point across and that just made it all worth it
6568765 youve got these younger kids who have so much enthusiasm and excitement
6568766 greg was the only one out of all the candidates who had been in our office and he just seemed to have the idealism that you want in a delegate
6568767 i first became involved in politics in 1972 with george mcgovern
6568768 and ive been involved ever since then the reason you first get into something like this is because you believe in what the people or the party represent for me particularly with ted kennedy he was pushing for a health plan and that was very important to me at the time
6568769 and i decided to run to be a delegate and take it to the national level so that i could be on the cutting edge of what was happening and ive been that way ever since
6568770 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6568771 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6568772 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6568773 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6568774 an alternately amusing and alarming primer on americas off the charts fiscal irresponsibility
6568775 in new york we dont think of alternative power as something that we just import from other parts of the nation
6568776 la ausencia de lluvias adecuadas en el per odo ptimo de implantaci n de trigo en gran parte del rea de cultivo provoca la imposibilidad en algunos casos y

6568778 el piloto les dijo que fallaba el motor izquierdo y que no
6568779 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6568780 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6568781 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6568782 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6568783 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6568784 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6568785 i have always believed that the second amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms
6568786 but i also identify with the need for crime ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common sense effective safety measures
6568787 americans across our country are hurting because of the cost of energy
6568788 its time for america to get serious about energy independence and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this
6568789 everyone says america is the land of opportunity for renewables
6568790 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6568791 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6568792 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6568793 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6568794 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6568795 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6568796 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6568797 the challenges we face today from saving our planet to ending poverty are simply too big for government to solve alone
6568798 if you get a federal grant you cant use that grant money to proselytize to the people you help and you cant discriminate against them or against the people you hire on the basis of their religion
6568799 federal dollars that go directly to churches temples and mosques can only be used on secular programs
6568800 for those of who us who believe in protecting the integrity of our religious institutions this is a fundamental right
6568801 return the law to what it was before the current administration
6568802 any religious organization that does not want to comply with that requirement simply doesnt have to take the money
6568803 if you cant hire people within your faith community than youve lost the distinctive that is the reason why faith based programs exist in the first place
6568804 disagrees with sen obama that hiring at faith based groups should be subject to government oversight
6568805 wants a faith based program thats even better than the bush program
6568806 his plan reminds me of much that was best in both then vice president al gores and then texas gov george w bushs respective first speeches on the subject in 1999
6568807 especially in urban america all the empirical evidence continues to show that local faith based organizations can make a measurable civic difference
6568808 i am disappointed that any presidential candidate would want to continue a failed policy of the bush administration it ought to be shut down not continued
6568809 i didnt grow up in a particularly religious household but my experience in chicago showed me how faith and values could be an anchor in my life and an anchor in the community
6568810 while i could sit in church and pray all i want i wouldnt be fulfilling gods will unless i went out and did the lords work
6568811 i think it is a bold smart engaging attempt to use religious organizations to help the poor and to do for the faith community what the bush administration could not
6568812 but im concerned that his position on hiring rights will bog down this initiative just like bushs position on the other side did the same thing
6568813 it is hopeless this one is like the other one they are all the same nothing will change dont expect change
6568814 hell have to be good to israel if not he wont be re elected to a second term
6568815 will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
6568816 the arabs need america to be straight and unbiased but anyway we feel that american policy will not be changed too much
6568817 one day he is with the palestinian cause one day hes with israel we have a saying here whats better a black dog or a white dog its all the same for us nothing will change
6568818 we rooted for this and that and nothing happened its deja vu
6568819 unless the americans realize that they really have to change and become more evenhanded and apply justice in the region things will be the same
6568820 obama is excellent he is direct he is like the successor to jfk
6568821 yes they are all bad but still obama might be a little less bad
6568822 for me it doesnt matter that hes black or his name is hussein
6568823 hes an american and so i disagree with most of what he says about the arab world i mean condoleezza rice was black and poor and she still invaded iraq
6568824 i think its very impressive that someone can start very poor and reach the top like this
6568825 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6568826 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6568827 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6568828 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6568829 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6568830 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6568831 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6568832 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6568833 going to react very well to the message of improving the economy ending the war making health care available and affordable improving education and right down the line
6568834 there doesnt seem to be any letup of the move toward democrats in terms of party registration in terms of party id
6568835 democrats in the state by and large are upper income high education liberal
6568836 we certainly anticipate that this is going to be a close race
6568837 no member of the sununu family has lost an election since 1980
6568838 just because youre 80 years old doesnt mean youre out of it
6568839 read a book write an article for the local paper run for the school board
6568840 because you exercise every muscle except the one above the neck
6568841 if i had my past over again id make all the same mistakes only sooner
6568842 shoot if you must this old gray head but spare your countrys flag
6568843 reagan democrats in some races but they are still democrats
6568844 mccain cant keep track and referred inquiring reporters to his staff
6568845 we were still right not to cover the story because it came from the
6568846 the story of edwards tryst was reported only by the national enquirer a tabloid that gives supermarkets a bad name
6568847 the national enquirer is a supermarket tabloid that is accurate some of the time and inaccurate some of the time
6568848 contributed to the lack of interest by the times others simply relied on standard elvis ufo aliens bigfoot jokes to dismiss the
6568849 the fact that big newspapers magazines and networks have standards that is they refuse to print every stray rumor just because its
6568850 washington posts media critic howard kurtz wrote the big newspapers magazines and networks have standards that is they refuse to print every stray rumor just because its
6568851 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6568852 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6568853 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6568854 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6568855 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6568856 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6568857 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6568858 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6568859 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6568860 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6568861 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6568862 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be
6568863 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6568864 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6568865 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6568866 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6568867 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6568868 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6568869 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6568870 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6568871 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6568872 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6568873 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6568874 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6568875 it was really just a great display of golf today he played fabulous theres not much else to say
6568876 he drove the ball straight he really controlled his trajectory on his iron shots hit the ball into the right spot of the green and holed a bunch of putts
6568877 he was six under this morning through 14 holes which is just something else around here
6568878 la organizaci n es muy buena yo no hab a estado en ediciones anteriores pero me hab an comentado que el publico de la plata era muy conocedor de los vinos y gracias a que este a o pude venir lo comprob espero volver
6568879 para una bodega como la nuestra es muy importante este tipo de eventos porque no realizamos publicidades nos permite acercar nuestros productos al p blico contarles un poco el proceso para hacer un buen vino y tambi n encontrarnos con amigos del mundo del vino
6568880 muy bien organizada es una feria muy bien armada adem s el teatro argentino le da un marco muy importante y distinguido espero volver el a o que viene y ojala se pueda superar a esta iv edici n suerte y que sigan creciendo
6568881 in most cases the infection is pretty mild people might not even be aware they have it
6568882 they might have a mild flu like illness maybe some mild abdominal pain and diarrhea
6568883 i think if people have eaten any of these foods but feel perfectly well they have nothing more to worry about and the vast vast majority of people who have eaten these products will not get sick
6568884 those would be the manifestations of the severe form of the disease when it happens and its fortunately not common but when it happens it can be a very serious life threatening disease
6568885 it can be as short as a few days but it can my be as long as a couple of months complicating investigation of an outbreak because its very difficult for people to remember what theyve eaten a few weeks or a few months before
6568886 this is about shifting the power back to the people
6568887 economic problems that will make this years financial turbulence look like a trip to the debt counselors office
6568888 you add that all up and its not a good year to be running as a republican in wisconsin for president
6568889 its an open question how much the race tightens up and whether wisconsin turns out to be right on the cusp nationally like it has been in previous elections or whether it leans democratic
6568890 people who were strong supporters of sen clinton based on who she is and what she stands for are recognizing that sen obama is much closer to the things that caused them to support her than is sen mccain
6568891 one of the key issues in florida is going to be turnout its very unpredictable
6568892 get out the vote is going to be critical for both candidates
6568893 wow hybrid a honkin big truck that gets 40 mpg
6568894 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6568895 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6568896 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6568897 many of the slotted speakers are impressive leaders in their own right
6568898 but it is hard not to notice the absence of the partys most pro growth elected officials
6568899 there are a lot of republicans in new mexico who are not as excited about their senate candidate as the democrats are about theirs
6568900 we think that right now iowa is a very strong pickup for us and thats important
6568901 i want someone whos mad right now that people are losing their jobs
6568902 during debates obama the former university of chicago professor of constitutional law keeps his head tilted thoughtfully as if in a seminar
6568903 from a theological perspective or scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
6568904 there are legions of voters who clearly thrive on the considered intellectual approach that has characterized obamas presidential bid finding it his core appeal
6568905 in the 21st century you do not invade sovereign nations
6568906 a budget surplus by pandering to lobbyist greased congressional leaders
6568907 they are independents an affiliation growing faster than republicans who resemble cafeteria catholics
6568908 provide short term relief to american families facing pain at the pump
6568909 who can wear a cowboy hat without looking like john kerry in camouflage
6568910 the good rain across time and terrain in the pacific northwest
6568911 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6568912 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6568913 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6568914 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6568915 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6568916 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6568917 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6568918 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6568919 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6568920 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
6568921 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
6568922 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
6568923 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
6568924 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
6568925 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
6568926 many in the christian right tend to get their information

6568935 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
6568936 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
6568937 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
6568938 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous

6568955 i looked the man in the eye i was able to get a sense of his soul
6568956 i think it is obvious that nato expansion does not have any relation with the modernization of the alliance itself or with ensuring security in europe
6568957 on the contrary it represents a serious provocation against whom is this expansion intended
6568958 im honored to do anything to help him win but the state and the budget are most important
6568959 because it shows the mccain campaign knows this is not about the base of the party but reaching the middle where the votes are
6568960 we know that war service can have both a physical and mental impact on the lives of service personnel physical impairment can be obvious psychological injury is less so
6568961 this government is determined to support veterans and ex service personnel who may suffer psychologically as a result of their service however to do so we need a better understanding of the incidence and characteristics of suicide amongst this community
6568962 we are seeking to better identify those at risk common contributing factors in recent cases the incidence of suicide in the ex service community and whether there is more that government agencies and the medical and allied health professions can do to support veterans under stress
6568963 its condominiums where ill have them get to you he said before quitting the campaign trail for three days to strategise with top aides as both the candidates finalise their choice of running mate
6568964 now think about that i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make us5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong he said
6568965 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their house you might have a different perspective
6568966 so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6568967 we cant afford eight more years or four more years or one more year of the same failed economic policies that president george bush has put in place senator obama said
6568968 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6568969 he couldnt count high enough to know how many houses he owns he said on cnn before introducing senator obama in chester by countering republican charges that the relatively inexperienced democrat is too

6568989 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side

6568993 if some guy came in and spelled george bush differently could you catch it
6568994 that he was impressed by a new generation of high technology devices and not the type most people see every time they go to the supermarket
6568995 had not been at the event in question but instead based its story on a pool report which indicated that bush was impressed by new scanner technology that could weigh groceries and read damaged bar codes
6568996 mr mccains sense of wonder evoked the episode in the early 1990s when george h w bush became overly impressed upon seeing a price scanner at a supermarket check out counter it suggested to some people that the president who had spent four years in the white house after spending eight years as vice president was out of touch with the lives of average americans
6568997 events are always a hot ticket their dating lives are gossiped about and sometimes merely their simple daily activities are chatter within the d c social set throwing these glamorous soirees every week they are the young personalities of georgetown and the darlings of the citys most fashionable clubs and hottest restaurants

6569000 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
6569001 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
6569002 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
6569003 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6569004 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6569005 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
6569006 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
6569007 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
6569008 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
6569009 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
6569010 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
6569011 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
6569012 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6569013 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6569014 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
6569015 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
6569016 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
6569017 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
6569018 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
6569019 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
6569020 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
6569021 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
6569022 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6569023 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
6569024 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
6569025 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
6569026 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6569027 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
6569028 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
6569029 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
6569030 michigan is for the most part a red state and its up to detroit and the
6569031 and unless we have someone out front whos able to speak and carry obamas message well its critical
6569032 we have a number of people who can stand with sen obama as a surrogate
6569033 shortly after the convention were going to have a come to jesus meeting to decide who are going to be the individuals to carry that message and carry obama around the state and around detroit
6569034 right now i think thats going to be a big challenge to make sure detroiters turn out
6569035 saddam hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors or the world with nuclear arms poison gas or biological weapons other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles with saddam there is one big difference he has used them not once but repeatedly i have no doubt today that left unchecked saddam hussein will use these terrible weapons again
6569036 you allow someone like saddam hussein to get nuclear weapons ballistic missiles chemical weapons biological weapons how many people is he going to kill with such weapons we are not going to allow him to succeed
6569037 threat posed by iraqs refusal to end its wmd programs
6569038 every nation has to be either for us or against us those who harbor terrorists or who finance them are going to pay a price
6569039 iraq continues to be a safe haven transit point or operational node for groups and individuals who direct violence against the united states saddams intelligence service supported financially ansar al islam whose members were being trained in al qaeda camps in afghanistan
6569040 husseins vigorous pursuit of biological chemical and nuclear weapons and his present and potential future support for terrorist acts and organizations make him a terrible danger to the people of the united states
6569041 my position is very clear the time has come for decisive action to eliminate the threat posed by saddam husseins wmds
6569042 every day saddam gets closer to his long term goal of nuclear capability
6569043 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat to the u s and our allies
6569044 to defend the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq
6569045 saddam is in material breach the legitimacy of the security council is at stake and if the security council does not call for the use of force i think we have little option but to act with a larger group of willing nations if possible and alone if we must
6569046 yes saddam has chemical weapons he has biological weapons he is trying to get nuclear weapons
6569047 the world is far safer with the removal of saddam
6569048 they are able to carry out far more seasoned tactical operations than they had been recently and were paying the price
6569049 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or wounded were consistent with air delivered ordinance
6569050 when suddenly not only are you feeling more insecure with your job you cant get rising wages or rising incomes and the cost of everything from gas to food to healthcare to trying to send your children to college keeps on skyrocketing
6569051 when you find out that you lost your healthcare your pension or you never had it it turns out youre not the only one
6569052 millions of americans have been going through that same loss of security
6569053 these tend to be folks that relocate here they tend to be younger voters also folks who obviously based on their lifestyle would be open to the prescription for change sen obama is offering
6569054 barack obama can spend all the money in the world in some of these republican leaning states but he will still be the most inexperienced presidential candidate in the modern era and he will still have the most liberal record in the united states senate
6569055 he is more liberal than a lot of the state
6569056 its going to be a very difficult race for him in north carolina
6569057 he cant make any promises that are going to help us tomorrow
6569058 its going to be a long time coming out of this
6569059 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6569060 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6569061 lebron might look like the granddad of the team but hes still one of the youngest
6569062 offense or defense lebron is always quarterbacking i think people dont realize that he has a point guards mentality he really sees the whole floor
6569063 lebron is at the level where hes at because of the commitment and sacrifices he what all superstars do you could tell it was not his first time on the basketball court in the offseason
6569064 its a crazy mismatch if you put him at the four
6569065 him being so versatile gives us a plethora of lineups to throw at teams
6569066 el presidente canario lleg durante la tarde de hoy a madrid donde procedi a visitar los distintos hospitales donde est n los supervivientes canarios por el accidente
6569067 el piloto les dijo que fallaba el motor izquierdo y que no
6569068 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6569069 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6569070 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6569071 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6569072 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6569073 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6569074 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6569075 no se trataba de un disparo que se cometiera al azar
6569076 tanto el sospechoso como la v ctima se conoc an
6569077 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6569078 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6569079 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6569080 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6569081 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6569082 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6569083 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6569084 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6569085 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6569086 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6569087 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6569088 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6569089 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6569090 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6569091 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6569092 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6569093 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6569094 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6569095 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6569096 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6569097 the texts in islam distinguish themselves from the texts of other religions by encouraging violence and aggression against people with other religious beliefs to a larger degree there are also straightforward calls for terror this has long been a taboo in the research into islam but it is a fact that we need to deal with
6569098 if it is correct that many muslims view the koran as the literal words of god which cannot be interpreted or rephrased then we have a problem it is indisputable that the texts encourage terror and violence consequently it must be reasonable to ask muslims themselves how they relate to the text if they read it as it is
6569099 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6569100 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6569101 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6569102 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6569103 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6569104 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6569105 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6569106 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
6569107 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6569108 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6569109 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6569110 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6569111 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6569112 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6569113 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6569114 are the only visible light manifestation of the intricate relationship between the black hole hosted at the center of the galaxy and the surrounding cluster gas
6569115 most spectacular feature is the lacy filigree of gaseous filaments reaching out beyond the galaxy into the multi million degree x ray emitting gas that fills the cluster
6569116 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6569117 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6569118 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6569119 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6569120 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6569121 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6569122 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6569123 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6569124 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6569125 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6569126 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6569127 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6569128 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6569129 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6569130 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6569131 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6569132 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6569133 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6569134 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6569135 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6569136 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6569137 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6569138 some theories say that small black holes in globular clusters should sink down to the center and form a medium sized one but our discovery suggests this isnt true
6569139 if a medium black hole existed in a cluster it would either swallow little black holes or kick them out of the cluster
6569140 we knew from x ray data that this black hole was actively swallowing up or accreting material if an intermediate sized black hole were accreting this material it wouldnt be too big of a deal for it but if a small black hole were accreting this material it would be a lot for it to take and therefore some material would be ejected in the form of high winds thus the high winds were our smoking gun showing that this black hole is small
6569141 its a massive increase in the real estate of the internet
6569142 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6569143 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6569144 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6569145 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6569146 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6569147 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6569148 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6569149 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6569150 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6569151 entered the plea in july in the eastern district of virginia but few were aware of the development simring has agreed to testify against the businessman billionaire ed okun as part of the deal simrings lawyer brian tannebaum told the national law journal simring faces up to five years in prison
6569152 simring took the plea deal in which he faces a possible five years in prison and must testify against his former boss before a grand jury could indict him according to his lawyer brian tannebaum of miamis tannebaum weiss
6569153 he didnt want to roll the dice and face a jury
6569154 facing 12 to 14 years in prison and having just become a father for the second time simring pleaded guilty said tannebaum hes agreed to testify against okun and faces a maximum five years in prison tannebaum said simring who has no record of bar complaints or crime regrets going to work for okun if he had it to do all over again he wouldnt make the same choices tannebaum said
6569155 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6569156 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6569157 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6569158 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6569159 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6569160 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6569161 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6569162 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6569163 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful

6569176 the addition of these rare representative works by francisca mel ndez member of a prominent dynasty of spanish artists and painter of portraits of the royal family is quite significant for us
6569177 the acquisition not only adds to our overall holdings of royal portraiture but it shows figures from the court of charles iv who were patrons of other artists in our collection such as goya so provides an important link to a number of 18 th century works on display at the meadows it also marks our first example of the genre of miniatures which played a vital role in court life and royal relations serving as important mementos tokens of affection or for formal introductions more significant still francisca mel ndez is the first female painter to be represented in the meadows collection

6569191 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6569192 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6569193 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6569194 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6569195 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6569196 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6569197 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6569198 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6569199 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6569200 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6569201 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6569202 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6569203 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6569204 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6569205 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6569206 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6569207 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6569208 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6569209 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6569210 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6569211 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6569212 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6569213 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6569214 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6569215 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6569216 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6569217 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6569218 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6569219 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6569220 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6569221 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6569222 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6569223 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6569224 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6569225 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6569226 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6569227 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6569228 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6569229 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6569230 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6569231 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6569232 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
6569233 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
6569234 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
6569235 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war

6569244 i gather my inspirations from art and literature from ancient symbolism and history and then combine that with the natural materials that seem to have a voice of their own
6569245 for many years i was told by retail shop owners that these would be great if i could just do them with colors i always knew that my line was not about flashy glaze colors but instead about the purity of the materials and the texts
6569246 a bird does not sing because it has an answer it sings because it has a song
6569247 i have put my own spin this tradition giving these birds the responsibility of carrying these meaningful poems on their backs
6569248 through a desire to create functional pieces that would be a part of everyday life
6569249 clay allowed me to create pieces that could be passed down through generations

6569252 one of the aims of irans 10 year space program is to send a manned rocket into space
6569253 within in the next six months to one year the exact date of this mission will be determined
6569254 its a little bit of a surprise how strong some of the numbers were in july
6569255 weve been waiting for some moderation but especially with some of the meat prices and how much has come through relatively recently at the retail level leads me to believe the overall number may be a little bit higher for the year

6569260 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6569261 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6569262 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6569263 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6569264 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees

6569267 que se tome la misma postura que la utilizada en la resoluci n del conflicto con la ate en el que afect al personal de educaci n
6569268 es justamente lo que estamos haciendo ya que al personal pomys que cumple servicios en las escuelas y que particip del paro se le aplicaron los descuentos correspondientes
6569269 el paro y las medidas de fuerza llevadas adelante por el sector docente han sido salvajes para ponerle un calificativo suave

6569283 y todas las personas que estuvieron involucrados en un caso que dej unos muertos por el camino presos y exilados fuera del pa s y es por eso que repito esta es una gran oportunidad para que la fiscal a saque adelante este caso as tenga meter preso a un ex fiscal de la rep blica y se gane su medalla de oro
6569284 los importante es que el ministerio p blico nos diga si en realidad la experticia que realizaron demuestra que estaban forjadas y si lo estaban contaminan el caso de los autores intelectuales de los materiales contaminan todo el expediente del caso anderson y pareciera que hay alguien que quiere enredar este caso
6569285 el que escribi el libreto el que escribi el libro el que organiz todo sabr c mo fue esto yo creo que en alg n momento tendr que darle la cara a la justicia aqu se ve que hubo libreto fiscales que se contradicen jueces que escrib an la sentencia en otro sitio en este caso hay de todo puede salir cualquier cosa afortunadamente veo que aqu la fiscal a cit a isa as rodr guez y a landaeta y lo nico que le critico es que van un poquito lento

6569289 porque los irresponsables de cemex nunca invirtieron en tecnolog a para eliminar ese polvillo
6569290 no les importa contaminar gente y playa lo de ellos es ganancia dinero pero no para invertir aqu sino para llev rselo
6569291 los mexicanos de la empresa cemex han sido irrespetuosos porque ellos en el fondo tienen algunos de esos gerentes con complejo de superioridad se sienten m s del norte y creen que nosotros somos macacos
6569292 el estado nacional el estado socialista a venezuela le estaban quitando todo el poder un pa s como era venezuela tomado por el poder transnacional no pod a ni podr a caminar por su propio pie
6569293 porque los irresponsables de cemex nunca invirtieron en tecnolog a para eliminar ese polvillo

6569297 hardwicke and rosenberg collaborated on the screenplay completing it over the course of six weeks
6569298 when it comes to founders we know we are usually going to see something odd
6569299 in some cases they are exorbitantly paid and in others they are paid miserly
6569300 they werent oversold with technology they didnt need nor were they pining for more features after the project was complete
6569301 usually because the prior company had failed to do any type of design work ahead of time
6569302 world famous bounty hunters leonard padilla and robert dick are dedicated to the capture of wanted fugitives making our communities and streets a safer place to live in
6569303 at what point give me a number give me a specific number do you move from middle class to rich
6569304 this was not a shooting that was a random act it was not random in nature
6569305 they are able to carry out far more seasoned tactical operations than they had been recently and were paying the price
6569306 none of the wounds sustained by those killed or wounded were consistent with air delivered ordinance
6569307 it was a huge act of aggression on the part of the georgian army
6569308 this is not yet a known story to the world
6569309 but i am sure that every day every hour the truth will be coming through
6569310 what i have seen today is stalingrad it is complete destruction
6569311 if not for the help of great russia there would have been even more numerous casualties here
6569312 for the ossetian people after the beslan tragedy to lose 2 000 more people is a terrible loss a terrible loss
6569313 only here thanks to this music i feel the fear leaving
6569314 i feel that life is returning to tskhinvali and the music helps me forget the horrors of the bombardment that i went through
6569315 music has reminded me that life is not only war
6569316 here i remembered that i am a construction worker and that means a creator
6569317 we have more than 200 cards like to address a traditional wedding a second wedding or an interracial wedding
6569318 we need to be relevant to as many people as we possibly can we heard that our customers wanted these cards so we provided them
6569319 we like to keep our cards new so these four wont be the only new ones
6569320 the majority of our hallmark crown stores are independently owned so they order what they want
6569321 i already try to carry some cards that suggests it fills that need people request them and we try to be responsive
6569322 obviously they are paying attention to a trend in the culture weve been pleased in new hampshire to pass a civil union law we celebrate civil unions here i hope soon to be able to say were celebrating a marriage
6569323 each person should be free to choose as we will with this issue and not legislate our particular morality on others
6569324 if you dont like the cards dont buy them when i went to testify in concord on the marriage equality bills i was amazed at what i heard from my colleagues allowing this does not constrain their religious freedom at all
6569325 we feel everyone should have the right to be who they are
6569326 if theres to be a marriage why should it have to be a man and a woman i know of a couple two women who have been together 28 years i am a hallmark customer i have their shopping card so i will be in thanking them for doing this
6569327 they always had a bride and groom on it never anything that can be construed as a same sex couple i was talking to a friend who said she had never found one and we thought thats a shame
6569328 kids are coming out sooner and are having support in schools
6569329 it will take a couple more generations to get there but we will
6569330 california and massachusetts have done the dumbest thing we will see a breakdown of families twenty five to 30 years from now families as we know them will be extinct i have been accused of being a bigot and that dont bother me i was raised in a generation where black was black and truth was truth theres no truth now you cant tell children about morals anymore because parents think it will warp their minds today there was a shooting in a school there is a price to pay
6569331 i would ask why are you here and they looked at me like i was dumb
6569332 i said youre here because you were taught you can do anything you please i brought some of them around they realized that if they had been taught right in grammar school they wouldnt be in prison its a spiritual law whatever you sow so shall you reap

6569352 but i believe people when they say the gameplay isnt what it should be and im perfectly sure if theyre saying that there is probably some truth in that
6569353 to the extent that i can i will try to get it better next time but in the end thats not my area of expertise
6569354 i think games are potentially an incredibly interesting art form and i want to be a part of creating those worlds
6569355 but i want them to be as original i dont want them to be zombie movies warmed up george romero has done that hes made the definitive movies now why make games of them
6569356 my thing with jericho was lets make something new it isnt impossible
6569357 you know people say everything has been done no you know 20 years ago when pinhead walked onto the screen nobody had seen anything else like it before and i feel when you talk about silent hill youre talking essentially the metamorphosis of zombie movies they have limited appeal for me
6569358 though i respect hugely the effort and the care and the beauty of games i want to be working with people who want to create the citizen kane of games and not just be warming up george romero

6569372 we know there are major understaffing issues in the banks already so any staff not being at work will put pressure on those services
6569373 there will be some regional branches that close but were not anticipating significant branch closures to be fair thats actually not the point the point is to send a strong message to the bank that we expect them to be a good corporate citizen

6569445 presents the most current and comprehensive analysis of the scientific evidence on the impact of these forces and other media exposures on beliefs attitudes and behaviours concerning tobacco use
6569446 this report sends a loud and clear message to policy makers we need less tobacco company marketing and more anti tobacco advertising
6569447 it shows why we need strong regulation of tobacco products and their marketing to prevent tobacco companies from continuing to target our children it also should prompt states to fully fund tobacco prevention and cessation campaigns that are proven to work and it should spur governments worldwide to implement the international tobacco control treaty which calls on governments to ban all tobacco advertising promotion and sponsorship and fund effective public education campaigns

6569454 because a spore body can be 1 5 to 2 microns wide by 1 micron long a sem cannot localize the elemental signal from whole spore bodies
6569455 lacked that fuzzy outer coating that would indicate that theyd been weaponized
6569456 i still dont understand why were out here tonight its halloween the badies are supposed to be takin the night off
6569457 stupid prophecy i had a whole night of way too much candy and scary cartoons to watch
6569458 buffy this is charlie brown youre never too old for charlie brown besides which i didnt want to watch a movie with vampires cause hello sunnydale is full of them i want my pretend pumpkin king
6569459 saying im not real of all the preposterous things to insinuate ill prove it im real theyll see when i take over the world
6569460 what do you mean what is it what do i look like to you im the great pumpkin king
6569461 wait you mean from charlie brown thats a cartoon youre not real
6569462 of course im real im sitting right in front of you
6569463 why dont you think that people take you seriously youve got a pretty hefty title i mean not many people can say theyre the king of anything it does demand a certain amount of respect
6569464 a are you kidding im a freakin pumpkin whos gonna take a pumpkin seriously no one thats who
6569465 so taking over the world is your solution gotta say not seein the logic there
6569466 besides which what are you gonna do roll everyone to death
6569467 you cant take anything seriously if you dont believe that something exists n no one thinks i doo
6569468 hey look uhm maybe we can figure something out taking over the world or trying to not a good idea
6569469 well what can i do i just want i want to be viewed like the king i am its why im here i was trying to find some minions i was told sunnydale was a great place to find minions
6569470 it is its just that if you tried to do what you want id have to slay you
6569471 ive heard of you i thought it was i thought you were just a myth
6569472 nope all about being real and in the flesh here
6569473 uh will you wanna clue the rest of the audience in

6569475 not really but she does this all the time theres a point i think
6569476 the point is that uhm king uh your majesty sir just because somedont know you exist doesnt mean that you cant be taken seriously look at buffy you thought she was a myth but i bet the stories you heard were all fear causing you can do the same
6569477 okay you could start telling others about your great battle with the best slayer that ever was or eh will be buffy tell them that you fought her and won you kicked her tush that should give you a better rep
6569478 what i meant was that you could totally say that itd be good and i bet all sorts of badies would take you seriously
6569479 but i so wanted little evil pumpkin minions we could rule the world it would be pumpkins everywhere
6569480 but this would be so much better all of the badies would be afraid of you thats better than ruling the world cause if you have their fear then you have their respect
6569481 you know things used to be so much easier children believed in me maybe not all of them but there was a pretty big percentage that did id say at least seven and then out of nowhere bam im no one to them santa claus replaced me in their minds but they just dont know that really hes the evil one im good i give them presents he kills them
6569482 so then you dont mind if i tell everyone i beat you
6569483 uhm i think ive had enough of the great pumpkin king for one night

6569822 we would like to see the united states provide assistance to the georgian military self defense equipment that will help them defend and deter against russian aggression in the future

6569918 if theres one important lesson that can be drawn from the blockbuster performance of warner bros the dark knight its that audiences arent afraid of a comic book movie that takes a walk on the dark grim side
6569919 however the same cant necessarily be said for fox topper tom rothman
6569920 despite the fact that the gritty hugh jackman topped film was met with a giddy response at this years comic con jeff wells says that rothman is pressuring director gavin hood to make the movie more kid friendly
6569921 perhaps rothman has taken his fan letter from steven spielberg too much to heart but a child friendly wolverine feels less

6569940 we have 14 draught beers and 40 in the bottle were open daily from 11am midnight we have outdoor seating free parking and free pool
6569941 i cant believe people are allowed to do this it is putting wealth before health
6569942 it is the same as smoking thalidomide and asbestos things that were put forward as safe
6569943 it took 60 years to bring in legislation banning smoking in public tobacco companies are still refusing to accept the link between smoking and cancer its nonsense
6569944 i dont want to find out in 60 years time masts are causing cancer
6569945 i would be worried about my health if i lived round here it is frightening
6569946 we have got to be strong dont give up they will bring it down if you put pressure on them

6569957 so im sorry but i have to focus or i will fail this like ive failed many other things
6569958 i think the main thing the opinion does is it takes the judge out of the quandary
6569959 where the defendant does not give him a definitive answer in words but through his actions
6569960 hopefully well see more application of the edwards rule that you cant fire your trial counsel
6569961 and this would have been a nice one to start with
6569962 today we recognize it is possible for a valid waiver of counsel to occur not only when a cooperative defendant affirmatively invokes his right to self representation
6569963 but also when an uncooperative defendant rejects the only counsel to which he is constitutionally entitled understanding his only alternative is self representation with its many attendant dangers
6569964 only dilatory behavior or other misconduct might justify waiver by conduct
6569965 our decision today is meant to provide trial courts with guidance and discretion not to force courts to discharge counsel against their better judgment
6569966 extensively warned garey on the record of the dangers of self representation
6569967 we would be unable to say the government had established jones waiver was knowingly made
6569968 now a criminal defendant has the burden of proving a negative
6569969 now hes got to prove that he doesnt have knowledge the absence of the warnings is typically evidence of lack of knowledge
6569970 im pretty sure that mr garey is going to require that i do
6569971 the courts ruling will give another tool to judges to deal with defendants who try to game and delay the system

6569973 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
6569974 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
6569975 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
6569976 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
6569977 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
6569978 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
6569979 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
6569980 we really want to get the message out to people
6569981 i got back the standard form letter thank you for your comment
