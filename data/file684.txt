6840000 i dont at all like knowing what people say of me behind my back it makes me far too conceited
6840001 we certainly feel sorrow for the loss of our comrades and for the difficult times the families have to go through but we take pride in the job these soldiers did
6840002 they were out there doing what they wanted to do
6840003 the commitment and sacrifice of these six fine soldiers and all who have fallen before them is helping to make a difference in the lives of the people of afghanistan
6840004 we will continue with our mission as we remember their sacrifice
6840005 he insisted many times are we not here for the kids is that not why we are here dustin was there for the kids and hoped one day his work would make a difference
6840006 we have one confirmed case of listeria thats associated with the provincial outbreak and that case is deceased
6840007 we have confirmed that the primary cause of death is listeriosis
6840008 weve put in place a new system that allows us to detect an outbreak and to see a pattern very early in the game
6840009 im glad we got hold of it early and now well take serious steps working with the feds to put it behind us
6840010 we will make sure that this provocation is not taking place
6840011 its not about our fear its about the people waiting in gaza you cant think about anything else
6840012 not only a companion but also a trustworthy guide an orientation and a reference point
6840013 he has always showed me the road to take even in difficult situations
6840014 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6840015 russia is not in compliance and russia needs to come into compliance now
6840016 is being carried out punctually and we do not intend to change it in the direction of extending the timetable
6840017 we believe that by the end of today there will be no more russian troops in close vicinity of the motorway
6840018 we see now they are pulling out from the city of gori and they seemingly are de blocking the main motorway
6840019 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying the cross
6840020 ich bin ganz gut zurecht gekommen es macht wirklich spa es ist eine tolle strecke sie haben wirklich einen tollen job gemacht f r einen stra en kurs ist er auch sehr sicher er ist wirklich sehr sch n geworden
6840021 es war eine katastrophe denn der webber ist vor mir gefahren ich war auf einer schnellen runde und er hat mich blockiert da er vor mir gefahren ist
6840022 ich habe es voll untersch tzt wie viel abtrieb man verliert wenn man direkt hinter einem auto ist
6840023 ich war vorsichtig habe aber dennoch keine chance gehabt drehte mich weg ich hatte gro es gl ck dass ich nicht angeschlagen habe
6840024 dort f hrt man vollgas hat sehr hohe seitliche fliehkr fte und gleichzeitig bremst man es ist eine besondere kurve die man in der formel 1 nicht so oft sieht dort ist das auto in allen richtungen belastet wenn dann etwas abtrieb fehlt dann stellt dies einen extremfall dar
6840025 die zweite kurve ist schwierig da man sehr kr ftig bremsen muss wenn du den bremspunkt ein bisschen verpasst dann musst du geradeaus fahren und kannst nicht mehr einlenken da du ansonsten in die reifenstapel rein f hrst dann hast du die runde vergeigt dort muss man das limit finden was nicht einfach ist
6840026 die dritte kurve ist auch interessant weil man dort knapp mit vollgas f hrt man muss sehr eng an der barriere fahren um sie mit vollgas zu fahren das macht spa in der 12 kurve kommt man mit h chstgeschwindigkeit an muss sehr hart bremsen da es eine der engsten kurven der strecke ist dann kommt eine passage in der drei kurven ineinander gehen das ist auch sehr sch n
6840027 es sieht f r uns auf jeden fall ein bisschen besser aus es war heute sehr schwierig zu sehen wo alle stehen da sich die strecke stark verbessert hat auch am ende wir m ssen abwarten
6840028 we have done a lot of work for the rich and famous this year we seem to be one of the go to bands to bop to whilst shaking your diamond earrings

6840036 as we go into the fall we know for example that the price of natural gas is going to go up an average of 20 per cent
6840037 for a family that means about a 260 a year increase which when looked at in grocery terms thats two or three weeks of groceries
6840038 its going to be quite difficult in the coming months in terms of their ability to put food on the table and to have a standard of living that is necessary
6840039 the rising price of gasoline energy food as well as tough economic times theyre coming together in a gathering storm
6840040 puts a few more steps into shopping looking around seeing what is the best bargain out there thats all you can do
6840041 hopefully the gas prices will level out a bit for the coming winter because thats always a problem too you cant get around as well
6840042 ive definitely rearranged what i buy where i buy and how i buy and i cant afford to drive the way i used to
6840043 public transit can be a blessing sometimes not as convenient but you do what you have to do
6840044 were starting to see the leading edge of the storm
6840045 we do some work in first nations community sandy lake located about 700 kilometres northwest of thunder bay
6840046 gas prices are even higher there 1 70 a litre it just absolutely and ultimately reduces your mobility

6840100 generally this involves tallying your resources formulating a budget and constructing a plan to make the best use of your income and assets over time

6840102 this can include hiring an attorney insurance agent and tax advisor as well as choosing a professional representative to help you apply for ssdi benefits youll also need help to choose a medicare plan just remember youre the team captain
6840103 procrastination is not an option here use your time wisely
6840104 this is an ongoing process once you begin financial planning youre demonstrating the decision to stay in control of your situation as much as you possibly can
6840105 as your disease progresses you are going to be in a better situation if youve already planned for the next steps including having to quit work and focus on your health
6840106 thats why you need to use the time you have now ultimately your day to day activities are going to become more limited and challenging with your condition and there is such a thing as acting too late

6840113 making it to a bcs game is a goal of the program no doubt about it
6840114 that s the expectation and i think it is reachable i think we are going to have a special season
6840115 i just didn t put in enough measures to overcome those things against the types of opponents we see early my hope is experience as both player and coach pulls us through and what we are going to do exactly i would rather not share
6840116 it is going to take a lot of focus to win those big games on the road
6840117 we learned that last year i think when we lost at ucla and tulsa we think we had a better team we re hoping we have the experience and maturity to overcome some of those things that have haunted us in the past
6840118 i haven t seen it from them yet but i am certainly aware of the possibilities of how this could be the perfect storm and set us up for a letdown
6840119 this is one of the all time great quarterbacks in byu history
6840120 his leadership his ability to read defenses and make plays i would put him up there with some of the best in the country
6840121 it is every quarterback s dream to lead a team to a conference championship so that s still my primary goal
6840122 all those individual honors and things don t mean a thing if we don t win so really that s all i am focused on right now
6840123 i m confident about the year we are going to have because of the guys we have around me
6840124 it s not all going to be on me and that s a nice thing to have
6840125 he can get outside the pocket and make plays but i really like his poise and his overall grasp of what it takes to win
6840126 the guys have worked hard enough to deserve to compete
6840127 theres no reason for us to plan on losing any games
6840128 the future is now and the players have worked darn hard
6840129 weve got to prove were better than a mediocre run of the mill football team
6840130 the defense was a question mark for me but the secondary has been a pleasant surprise it should be a good year but theyve got to play on saturdays
6840131 i never lost in high school and ive never won in college this is my last year i just want to get some wins

6840153 cuba are a great team with some great players they hit our pitching mistakes they hit them over the fence
6840154 i am not thinking of next year now and will not until the end of the season
6840155 i am not talking to anyone now at all i am fully focussed on this years championship and i am not worried about next year
6840156 i think the team is definitely talking to fernando but thats the question mark
6840157 i have never been so enthusiastic about my whole situation with the team
6840158 i left ferrari because i didnt have the freedom to do what i wanted to do i have that at honda but i still have not had the car to perform and i am waiting for that chance
6840159 what can i say but honestly the day that i feel that i am slower than my first race is the day i will call it off and stop the conversations are there and i am talking to the team i am talking to all the teams i want to be racing
6840160 im not worried in a way its good the team are talking to someone like alonso who has a lot of experience and with good teams
6840161 they are going to talk to other drivers thats only natural but im very happy with my position within the team rubens is a team mate i think he is fantastic has done a great job and he gives excellent feedback probably better than any other driver out there
6840162 the second estimate of second quarter uk gdp clearly increases the already strong chances that the economy will fall into recession over the coming quarters
6840163 the economy now looks set to grow by just 1 2 percent or so this year with a very strong chance of a technical recession in the second half and things will be considerably worse in 2009
6840164 the governments priority is to guide britain through these challenging times while also supporting those hit hardest as a result of these global factors
6840165 follows downward revisions to the growth in output of the production construction and services industries
6840166 we continue to expect a technical recession in the second half of the year and the mpc to respond with the first in a series of rate cuts in november
6840167 we judge that the risks of an earlier move have risen
6840168 with gdp flat in the second quarter and further signs of slowing activity a contraction in the third quarter is now highly likely
6840169 as a result the risks to medium term inflation are likely to subside giving the bank of england the scope to cut interest rates sooner than they may have thought possible
6840170 we could win the gold medal in every single track and field event but if we dont win a single thing in the sprints and relays the public will view our performance as a disaster
6840171 when we drop the baton in back to back relay races the public views our performance as a disaster
6840172 we can be a much better team and we will be
6840173 we will conduct a comprehensive review of all our programs it will include assessments from inside and outside the usatf family
6840174 included in the assessment will be the way in which we select train and coach our relays
6840175 they all say more or less the same thing the dropped batons were reflective of a lack of preparation lack of professionalism and of leadership i agree
6840176 dropping a baton isnt bad luck its bad execution responsibility for the relay debacle lies with many people and many groups from administration to coaches to athletes
6840177 ultimately the athletes on the track are the only ones who can successfully pass the stick around the track but they need proper leadership and preparation
6840178 theres no denying we have had more than our share of bad luck
6840179 the public sometimes sees these things and sees only failure rather than the nature of the games
6840180 when the mens marathon concludes on sunday well still be the worlds number one team in terms of medal count
6840181 in the mens and womens 200 im not sure there was any stopping the jamaican juggernaut at least not when it comes to gold medals
6840182 nobody from any country was going to beat 9 69 and 19 30
6840183 we wont have nearly as many gold medals as weve won the last two world championships and gold is what gets it done
6840184 paintings edge clarified for me that we live in a time when paintings true sister is once again poetry not because of any similarity in the mediums theres virtually none but because both have been marginalized and are now loved by a relative few

6840194 these experiments are aimed at better understanding the factors that motivate consumers to engage in actions for the benefit of the environment this important topic along with pro social behavior in general is a severely understudied area of consumer research

6840196 the results of our studies have clear implications for marketers managers and policymakers
6840197 it is worth noting that the normative messages which were messages that we have never seen utilized by hotel chains fared significantly better at spurring participation in the hotels environmental conservation program than did the type of message most commonly utilized by hotel chains essages that focus on the importance of environmental protection
6840198 the research findings suggest that viewers donated because they felt an obligation to do so eople expect self or social censure if they dont help when they feel empathy for a person or organization they care about
6840199 failing to help under these conditions often leads to shame which is a powerful negative emotion that is experienced when there is an inconsistency between a persons actual and desired self
6840200 paradoxically it is by helping others that we derive self benefits in the form of enhanced self esteem and social approval erving others connotes valued human traits including compassion cooperativeness and kindness
6840201 arguably as the bigger more cost efficient stores move out the poor increasingly are likely to find themselves choosing between traveling farther to purchase nutritious competitively priced groceries or paying inflated prices for low quality processed foods at corner stores
6840202 stores pricing and location decisions in most instances are guided by competitive factors rather than any bias against the poor or their neighborhoods
6840203 one suggestion would be to explore the possibility of encouraging co operative stores which spreads the ownership among a relatively large group of stake holders within the poor community while at the same time increasing its operational economies of scale another possibility might be to consider joint ownership or management of franchises of selective stores in the poorest neighborhoods by the corporate owners of big grocery chains and poor residents
6840204 lo m s escandaloso es que no es la primera vez que el gobierno demuestra ser completamente incapaz de proteger la integridad de informaci n altamente sensible lo que le incapacita para encomendarle la protecci n de nuestra seguridad
6840205 major life events may precipitate or co occur with the development of chronic daily headaches
6840206 in the end the signal is based on only a few events but it is not particular events that you can point to instead it is a subtle statistical difference in the population of events that tells you that the single top is in the mix
6840207 for example i could say that the population of danes is on average slightly taller than the population of norwegians
6840208 if however i had a sample with an unknown mix of danes and norwegians i could estimate the fraction of danes knowing only their heights
6840209 these 60 events differed only in the tiniest details from the rest of the sample of 1 400 events
6840210 these three discrimination methods had not been used in a search before the graduate students and postdocs who did the analyses really broke a lot of new ground

6840266 two members of the commission were attacked cursed and sworn at by two women who were blatantly dolled up
6840267 one of the women took out a black container and sprayed a substance at them while the other filmed what happened with her phone camera while making improper comments

6840269 the riyadh chamber of commerce and industry rcci did not inform travel agencies across the kingdom of a ban on saudis traveling to thailand and so many saudis who visited the country at the beginning of the summer have returned to face questioning from the kingdoms authorities has for the past 12 years been on a list of countries that saudis are not allowed to visit the list includes israel iraq and bosnia however for the past three years restrictions on saudi visitors to thailand have been eased with many families and youths visiting the far eastern country people believe the ban has been reinforced because of men who visit thailand to drink alcohol visit prostitutes and then be robbed and at times murdered in an interview with asharq al awsat abdullah al tamimi of the rcci said that only businessmen are allowed to visit thailand and are required to furnish relevant documents proving they are indeed businessmen

6840278 when i did my first album i said that when i did a second i wanted gary to write for me i think he is a great songwriter one of britains best songwriters i love take that so it was always a dream of mine that hed write for me
6840279 he said it was fantastic i hope in future gary will play when i sing
6840280 when i was contacted by bryn about performing at the festival i said i would like whoever won the nancy role to sing in concert with me
6840281 i think its important that we help promote the people we choose to win i backed jodie really quietly for the whole time as i really believed in her when people see her do other things they will realise what a star she really is
6840282 bryn has asked me to be involved for a few years but because of filming ive never been able to
6840283 but this year i hadnt finalised my schedule for torchwood so i told them to make sure i could have time off to do it
6840284 torchwood has really reached out to audiences worldwide and the fact its moved up the channels on the bbc is incredible
6840285 we moved from cardiff bay to the beach i really love wales so its great to have the chance to play at a big festival here
6840286 i love the people and the place we decided to have our civil partnership in cardiff and the response we got from people was unbelievable our neighbours in sully are wonderful i feel at home here
6840287 we have a house in london because we still work in london but our main house is in wales
6840288 i never want to be pigeon holed im an entertainer whether im entertaining a teenage girl whos watching me judging on a tv show a young guy watching doctor who or a couple watching torchwood the fact i can diversify is great
6840289 ooh i dont know you will have to watch they are talking about it i would like to see a year hiatus before theres another one you need to put a pause on something when you have such a good thing going rather than flog it like a dead horse
6840290 it was the highest rated show on the bbc that evening ive had a huge response to people saying theyre more open minded now
6840291 teenagers have written to me and said theyre more comfortable with coming out now some were on the brink of suicide but changed their minds im really pleased with that
6840292 theres nothing wrong with who i am or being gay and i wanted people to see that there are always people who wont like me but all i ask is people respect me
6840293 classic disruptive innovation where the mainstream dismisses the product and small companies have time to create a real differentiated value
6840294 gives a new perspective on the english civil war through the eyes of angelica fanshawe riseborough who is drawn to the anti monarchist cause at a time when england executed its king in favor of an alternative form of government
6840295 considering the british traditions of free speech and the individual and the british suspicion of organized crowds we would want to avoid the leni riefenstahl connotations which were there in beijing and the ceremony was too long
6840296 i never want to be pigeon holed im an entertainer whether im entertaining a teenage girl whos watching me judging on a tv show a young guy watching doctor who or a couple watching torchwood the fact i can diversify is great
6840297 its an incredible feeling to be olympic champion its been a long time coming
6840298 it was a fantastic race probably the most enjoyable race i have ever had and i am really pleased not just for me but for my coach friends and family who have given me so much support
6840299 mum took me down to the local canoe club when i was 10 and i loved it so much i never looked back
6840300 she supported me all the way and it was a huge regret that she didnt live long enough to see me win the world championships last year
6840301 i went to her grave and left the flowers they gave me for winning it was an emotional moment for me now the focus is on getting that prized gold medal im determined to do it and it will be dedicated to her
6840302 y was serious and dark and grounded in reality where doctor who is quite playful it does affect my mood at the table ive noticed
6840303 the trick is to find a way to graphically impersonate these characters their gestures and expressions so that it feels natural in the end its either spot on or something your uncle does at christmas dinner i dont know how close i am to the former fingers crossed its not the latter
6840304 maybe im just happy to be drawing so many men after drawing a gazillion women for the last seven years
6840305 that only just occurred to me a couple of weeks ago and it actually made me giggle
6840306 the power of the subconscious is a surprising and mysterious thing
6840307 at first i was thinking to have something elaborate on the floor beneath the doctor to make the first page splash really pop
6840308 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in
6840309 i went online and started looking at tile work and this one piece jumped out at me it was an italian floor created by cosmati
6840310 i know it seems like a crazy amount of extra work for an easter egg but its those things that make the work more fun as you go its something i did a lot of on y and its a hard habit to break
6840311 when i was six i lived in finland for about a year and what television there was and of those the ones in english were all itv shows the phoenix and the carpet the muppets toms mindnight garden i claudius and grange hill they were all shows i enjoyed and they had a really specific look about them we later moved to toronto and i remember my aunt watching this show on tvontario that had that look there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked
6840312 i love the new stories like i loved those old fourth doctor ones especially with tennant who captures the doctors personality so beautifully that manic enthusiasm
6840313 but now theres the added bonus of seeing it from an adult perspective theres more of an appreciation for the story probably the best way to put it baker is the doctor of my childhood but tennant is my doctor today
6840314 there are a bunch of stories percolating in my head that id like to write

6840332 were extremely excited to release helix to the general public its one of the most innovative music rhythm games ever designed you use the wii remote controllers to do over 30 upper body moves while listening to fast paced music you do all this while the backgrounds and the wii remote controllers pulse to the beat
6840333 helix is not only fun its a great workout you can really burn some calories playing this game you tend to lose yourself playing the game and forget that youre even getting a workout because the gameplay is compelling
6840334 we listened to thousands of songs and narrowed it down to the 26 you find in this game these 26 tracks are amazing and come from independent musicians that you wont find elsewhere its the type of music you want to hear over and over again because its so good weve included over 26 songs to play so the replay value is absolutely incredible for 1000 wii points
6840335 ive always been interested in the area and heard so many stories about the architecture and the manmade palm islands
6840336 i think it will be a totally different thing from teaching at wickwire much more hands on
6840337 im sure ill make a few unintentional cultural mistakes but you do have to respect their culture
6840338 i was exhausted to keep plugging away and not fall off it was tough
6840339 cuba are a great team with some great players they hit our pitching mistakes they hit them over the fence
6840340 we could win the gold medal in every single track and field event but if we dont win a single thing in the sprints and relays the public will view our performance as a disaster
6840341 when we drop the baton in back to back relay races the public views our performance as a disaster
6840342 we can be a much better team and we will be
6840343 we will conduct a comprehensive review of all our programs it will include assessments from inside and outside the usatf family
6840344 included in the assessment will be the way in which we select train and coach our relays
6840345 they all say more or less the same thing the dropped batons were reflective of a lack of preparation lack of professionalism and of leadership i agree
6840346 dropping a baton isnt bad luck its bad execution responsibility for the relay debacle lies with many people and many groups from administration to coaches to athletes
6840347 ultimately the athletes on the track are the only ones who can successfully pass the stick around the track but they need proper leadership and preparation
6840348 theres no denying we have had more than our share of bad luck
6840349 the public sometimes sees these things and sees only failure rather than the nature of the games
6840350 when the mens marathon concludes on sunday well still be the worlds number one team in terms of medal count
6840351 in the mens and womens 200 im not sure there was any stopping the jamaican juggernaut at least not when it comes to gold medals
6840352 nobody from any country was going to beat 9 69 and 19 30
6840353 we wont have nearly as many gold medals as weve won the last two world championships and gold is what gets it done
6840354 the perception is that weve managed to muck up several key events some people have taken that key event letdown and applied it somewhat unfairly to the entire team
6840355 john mccains been living like this for the last 25 and obviously doesnt have a very clear sense of what ordinary americans are going through

6840360 not only has former gop assemblyman dean andal turned in several sub par fundraising quarters in a row but he has also spent a lot of the last month on the defensive answering questions about his role as a consultant for a community college development project
6840361 is facing increasing scrutiny over his role in a botched construction project at a community college
6840362 a prominent state senator mike machado late last week called on the california state controllers office to conduct an audit of the san joaquin delta college board of trustees after the board allegedly misappropriated 250 million in government backed bond funds set aside for the reconstruction of the community college campus
6840363 democratic strategists have suggested that internal polls show andals support dropping since the community college story has received wide circulation in the district and have promised that andals role in the controversy is certain to be fodder for political ads later in the fall

6840372 the longer a serious disease goes undiagnosed the harder it is to treat and the further it can spread
6840373 this new test will eliminate a lot of the guesswork
6840374 being able to get such quick results for so many pathogens at once will become critical in case of bioterrorism

6840378 our goal is to make discoveries that will ultimately allow us to intervene with the most effective early therapy before a mild traumatic brain injury results in a chronic problem
6840379 there is a high prevalence of mild traumatic brain injury in soldiers and the consortiums work is driven by that we believe the conclusions of our research also will benefit civilians including athletes who have suffered concussions
6840380 the award of this grant confirms the collaborative platform of mission connect is a powerful and pivotal force in research
6840381 uniting these premier scientists in this shared research effort will accelerate the pace of discovery and provide the courageous men and women in our military with the best possible medical care for the brain injuries they have sustained
6840382 this grant is a huge boost to research in traumatic brain injury and will allow investigators to work together through mission connect
6840383 for baylor college of medicine it will help fund 10 investigators in neurology neuroscience neurosurgery and pain management and physical rehabilitation
6840384 only through collaboration can we make great strides in restoring function for our young brave men and women in the armed forces
6840385 we in the medical field must serve these men and women by moving the frontiers of treatment faster to provide state of the art interventions now
6840386 an effort led by drs doug dewitt and donald prough of the moody center for brain and spinal cord injury mission connect at utmb is a pivotal component of the department of defense project leading the field with a new blast injury model that simulates the exposure to improvised explosive devices additionally innovative therapies using stem cells anti inflammatory agents growth hormones and the expertise of aggressive rehabilitation at the transitional learning center round out the critical components of utmbs efforts
6840387 oxidative stress is a prominent feature of traumatic brain injury
6840388 we have developed a new antioxidant agent based on carbon nanotubes and in collaboration with dr thomas kent of the baylor college of medicine we will examine the therapeutic potential of the agent to treat mild tbi
6840389 our ability to apply novel intervention strategies to nervous system trauma based on the cellular and molecular biology observations made over the years would suggest that we will be able to make an impact on the treatment modalities to be developed over the next five years
6840390 at utmb the neuroscience research community has a long tradition of excellence dedicated to the understanding of trauma to the nervous system we are very happy to be able to make a contribution to this joint texas effort in what is an exemplary example of translational efforts at utmb
6840391 the institutions that make up mission connect have a long history of working together successfully this significant grant is testament to the fact that our collaboration makes us more competitive for funding than any one of our schools would have been alone and more importantly it strengthens our ability to improve the lives of those affected by traumatic brain injury
6840392 the award is very forward thinking since in addition to clinicians it includes neuroscientists working to elucidate the very basic and fundamental causes of nervous system injury all the way down at the molecular and cellular level
6840393 at present we know very little about how brain injury disrupts the connections and communication among neurons the neuroscientists participating will fill this huge gap in our knowledge armed with this information and working together in a collaborative environment clinicians and neuroscientists stand a much better chance of designing new and innovative treatments for traumatic brain injury
6840394 congratulations to dr valadka and the team for receiving this very prestigious and competitive funding which will improve our knowledge of the complex mechanisms involved in traumatic brain injury the awarding of this grant validates our national stature in the neurosciences and will improve patient care and clinical outcomes for many patients
6840395 a model of innovative thinking and close collaboration between multiple institutions to understand and to advance the care of patients with mild traumatic brain injury
6840396 mild traumatic brain injury is a tremendous problem and there is an outstanding team in place ready to tackle it

6840410 the massive form of twisting geometric shapes and colours attracts just about everyone who sees it it is visually interesting and it becomes the centrepiece for meeting and conversation but that is not at the expense of the function of bloqx because of this harmony between form and function bloqx has initially been one of the most popular products we have ever shown to architects
6840411 when you reach the top it is the place to see and be seen and meet new friends

6840424 entre los cuatro o cinco m s duros f sicamente del mundo
6840425 el circuito es bastante duro est entre los cuatro o cinco circuitos m s duros del mundial hay tres o cuatro grandes frenadas en las que pasas de s ptima velocidad a 300 y pico por hora a primera que obligan a aguantarlas un poco con el cuerpo la verdad es que cuando llegas a boxes con la humedad y el calor aparte del l quido que pierdes es duro f sicamente
6840426 es m s lento de lo que parec a caminando
6840427 hay tres o cuatro curvas de primera velocidad que pens bamos que iban a ser en segunda sobre todo estaba muy sucio
6840428 esta ma ana hab a como polvo como tierra en el circuito y a medida que ha ido avanzando el d a hemos ido teniendo m s agarre y yo creo que ahora con la gp2 y las dem s categor as que van a rodar la pista estar ma ana en mejores condiciones y podremos divertirnos un poco m s hoy ha sido un poco patinaje
6840429 m s que nada porque el primero y el segundo son largas rectas y frenadas para curvas lentitas el ltimo sector es la nica parte donde combina algunas curvas a derecha izquierda entrelazadas m s o menos a tope y es donde m s te diviertes
6840430 se llega desde la recta m s larga en la que se alcanzan los 312 o 313 km h y la curva creo que se da a 57 por hora es una frenada brutal
6840431 bastante sucio cuando te sales de la l nea de carrera por lo que adelantar ser una maniobra arriesgada
6840432 tenemos que analizar los datos en hungr a donde tampoco se puede adelantar hicimos una estrategia pensando en la carrera bamos muy largos parando el ltimo y sali bien ya que finalizamos cuartos o sea que hay que intentar clasificar bien pero pensando tambi n en carrera
6840433 salimos con poca carga aerodin mica y vimos que era demasiado poca porque el coche era completamente inconducible tuvimos que poner un poquito m s de aler n y seguimos siendo bastante r pidos en la recta
6840434 para ma ana habr que pensar si dejamos este tipo de carga aerodin mica o si ponemos m s y yo creo que con la mejora que va a haber en la pista ma ana ser m s f cil conducir para todo el mundo

6840468 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6840469 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6840470 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6840471 the number of us military bases would depend on the size and the needs of the troops

6840489 for the past half century it has been agreed that damage occurs in metal foils wires in ic chips because of the electromigration phenomenon which creates voids in the foils
6840490 with time the voids grow in size until eventually the foils cease to conduct electricity and a malfunction in the chip occurs
6840491 if electric current is water in a river then atoms in copper grains are like pebbles in the river with time pebbles in the outer rim of the river would be washed away creating a void of space where the pebbles used to exist
6840492 today the copper foils used in ic chips are nano scale and single grain the structure looks like bamboo with each compartment of the bamboo being a grain of copper
6840493 however if we employ a pulsed electro deposition to synthesize a copper foil instead of continuous electro deposition a nanotwin foil can be created
6840494 we saw that at twin modified grain boundaries atomic diffusion is slowed because moving atoms cannot travel as smoothly when they have to hop over a twin boundary to go onto the next grain which has oppositely oriented crystalline

6840514 taiwanese are now more and more aware of issues in environmental protection however it is also important to collaborate and make exchanges with other countries on environmental matters as the effort to fight global warming should be taken to the international level
6840515 environmental diplomacy is not difficult and would be immensely helpful not only for taiwan but for the world
6840516 many of you have been to taiwan before but the visit is different from previous trips because the situation across the taiwan strait has changed fundamentally

6840527 for the past 400 years aboriginal history has been recorded only from non aboriginal perspectives we need to construct an aboriginal perspective on history

6840531 ma once said that aborigines dont have any problem in their genes but they have problems in getting opportunities
6840532 of course there is no problem in our genes it seems like ma regards the aboriginal movement as a social issue
6840533 for the past 400 years aboriginal history has been recorded only from non aboriginal perspectives we need to construct an aboriginal perspective on history
6840534 among aborigines there is the issue of unequal distribution of resources
6840535 for example since the amis are the most populous they may get more resources than other smaller tribes and we should fix this
6840536 before the first change of power we considered the government our enemy because it was an authoritarian regime
6840537 we keep talking about ideologies without considering that political parties need votes so weve become marginalized
6840538 as members of a democratic society we should adjust our mentality and try to enter into dialogue with the government not just remain opposed to it
6840539 democracy 21 urges freshman democratic members of the house not to attend or otherwise participate in the reception at the national convention to honor freshman members
6840540 any freshman democrat who does participate in the august 27 reception should be treated by the public and media as failing to comply with the language meaning purpose and spirit of the new house ethics rule prohibiting representatives from participating in lobbyist funded events at the conventions to honor the representatives
6840541 one of the important new ethics rules adopted by the house and the senate prohibits representatives and senators from participating in lobbyist funded events at the national conventions that are held to honor or recognize the members
6840542 the purpose of this rule was to end the practice of lobbyists and lobbying organizations currying favor with members of congress by throwing receptions and parties to
6840543 it would lead to the ridiculous result whereby a lobbying organization would be prevented from throwing a reception or party at the conventions to curry favor with a single representative such as a committee chairman but would be permitted to throw the same reception or party at the conventions to curry favor with a group of representatives such as an entire congressional committee including the committee chairman
6840544 only the house ethics committee has come up with its indefensible odd man out interpretation to allow lobbyists to pay for receptions and parties at the national conventions to honor a group of members of congress
6840545 house democratic freshman members should not attempt to use the house guidance as cover to attend or otherwise participate in the lobbyist funded reception to honor them next week that the new house ethics rule was clearly intended to and does prevent them from participating in

6840561 this is a massive documentary project both inside and outside the pepsi center designed to cover a wide variety of issues and personalities
6840562 it is a strictly nonpartisan effort and the resulting footage will be freely shared edited and distributed in a variety of formats including broadcast tv short and feature length documentary distributed at film festivals and used in programming across the nation and around the world

6840564 address any lingering doubts our customers may have about windows vista
6840565 i think microsoft has been quite up front about the gap between the publics perception of vistas capabilities and vistas actual capabilities the company earlier this summer admitted it needed to invest more resources into addressing lingering public perceptions that vista is a dog of a product that has failed to live up to its potential signing jerry seinfeld up as a spokesperson is an early step along this road
6840566 isnt so much a knee jerk reaction to this situation than it is a concerted effort by microsoft to shed its image as a stodgy marketer apple has its rock star ceo steve jobs who turns every major announcement into a cultural event microsoft has never had similar dna but that doesnt mean it cant take a stab at being a little cooler than it has been in the past
6840567 microsoft isnt in crisis mode just yet but the writing is on the wall for both of its major cash cow franchises windows and office the shift toward the web is putting pressure on microsoft to address market performance shortcomings more aggressively i would expect more high profile marketing announcements along the lines of the jerry seinfeld deal in the months to come as microsoft can no longer afford to trail the industry in terms of the punching power of its messaging
6840568 its not like we are wealthy people but theyll kidnap you for a watch everyone is living in fear

6840570 they are a prime target because theyve got money and theyve got a worry and you can combine those two and offer them a false sense of security which is exactly what this is

6840586 under current circumstances there will be no solid evidence to adequately prove that the huge amount of money that chens wife wired overseas were the gains of corruption committed by chen during his tenures as president and taipei mayor
6840587 in the current legal environment there is no way to charge chen with corruption
6840588 if that law is put into force chen would unavoidably be found guilty and many figures from the democratic progressive party and the chinese nationalist party kmt could be indicted

6840591 these are some of the boldest changes weve ever made
6840592 it is a shift in the business model for our sellers and for ebay we are asking sellers to rethink their listing strategies and giving them economic incentives to do that
6840593 we are really recognizing e commerce in general and what our buyers are seeing anywhere else online
6840594 it is going to make the process faster and more reliable
6840595 we think auctions really work for unique items rare items hard to find items or one of a kind in demand items
6840596 we are shifting most of the fees onto the back end but we think that with the change in our listing fee we are extremely competitive
6840597 the goal is to be the most competitively priced site on the web
6840598 amazon has been cutting pretty heavily into ebay sales and amazons growth has been going phenomenally
6840599 i think the bloom is off the auction a bit by and large people want to be able to go in and get things quickly

6840608 wanted to have a welcoming community of homes within the larger sunshine coast community
6840609 when we held the initial envisioning session for wakefield beach the response was overwhelmingly in favour of creating a beach shared by everyone
6840610 the beach is a place to gather have a picnic roast marshmallows on the bonfire celebrate holidays it is a shared amenity for the whole community that encourages neighbours to become friends
6840611 characterized by distinctive curved roof lines and an artistic use of timber and glass
6840612 high ceilings and doors that open to the outdoor living space make the landscape feel like an extension of the homes
6840613 deep green means the homes are designed to have minimal impact on the environment without sacrificing comfort or luxury
6840614 we have achieved this by incorporating sustainable features inside and outside the homes green roofs reduce heat buildup and retain water naturally and locally supplied products reduce the need for long distance transportation
6840615 we have also included energy efficient electrical appliances geothermal heating and cooling systems high performance window glazing and low flow plumbing fixture

6840633 in other words an increase in the isps business will also result in a boom for existing telcos given this scenario the government would do well to accept the regulators recommendations
6840634 although we have seen some improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6840635 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment

6840637 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6840638 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis
6840639 we were very innocent and we didnt know what was going on

6840668 milf units that targeted villages have engaged in serious violations of international law and should be held to account
6840669 but experience from around the world shows that the deployment of civilian militias can set off a chain of reprisals and only increases the danger facing civilians

6840676 i signed silvestre because he was the kind of player who can complete our team in every aspect of what we needed a left footed player experience at the back and some maturity as well
6840677 the thinking is that he has a great team attitude and we are a bit light in terms of experience in the dressing room so he can help us on that front

6840684 the figure marked a 0 75 percent increase year on year but translated into a drop in real wages as inflation rose 3 89 percent for the same period
6840685 the situation is likely to worsen as consumer prices jumped 5 92 percent year on year last month and nominal wages are unlikely to change much
6840686 the number marked the highest in history but i believe they will soon land jobs after adopting a more pragmatic approach

6840761 there are those that are quite glad to see a return to civilian government and there are others that are also concerned with i think the uncertainty of what is going to happen now for the future
6840762 help christians in the country know how to be good citizens at a time when pakistan needs good citizens

6840764 father thomas is a martyr he sacrificed his life for the poor and marginalized he did not die in vain because his body and his blood enrich the church in india particularly the church in andhra pradesh the indian church is shocked and deeply saddened by this barbarous killing which is the result of a growing climate of intolerance and violence against christians in the country
6840765 have for decades been at the service of the less fortunate in india and this makes them targets of evil forces who do not want the marginalized and impoverished to become empowered
6840766 the detention of the yemeni christians not only violates their human rights but also exposes them for further human rights violations like torture and even extrajudicial killings yemeni authorities should fulfill their obligations under international human rights law by releasing the christians and respecting the freedom of their citizens to follow the religion of their choice
6840767 trying to plan for the future without a sense of the past is like trying to plant cut flowers
6840768 we know he signed over in russia but we are asking him to reconsider and to make a decision to come back
6840769 we feel alex is a very very good young player with a great future ahead of him we feel he got some bad advice in this situation and hope eventually he will want to return to play with best players in the world in the best league in the world
6840770 but having said that we dont want to force him to come back until he wants to come back that is not good for alex or for his teammates as of sept 1 were moving on
6840771 whats the sense when we dont even know if hes going to play yet

6840776 the christian movement has sufficiently matured in latin america so that we can prepare our own peoples as missionaries
6840777 nationals have a distinct advantage in the mission field in that they are intimately familiar with the culture and language something foreign missionaries may struggle with for years
6840778 the role of american support in worldwide missions is important
6840779 i have partnered with many american churches and hope to continue to do so nonetheless the great commission applies equally to latin americans and i started the imms to prepare nationals to fulfill it effectively and efficiently we must be good stewards of gods resources

6840784 organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful
6840785 i dont think its possible to exaggerate the significance of this thing
6840786 every time i think of it im amazed at every level theyre absolutely in the business of revolutionizing the nature of knowledge search has become integral in the way we think and act in 50 or 100 years time when the real histories get written of the internet it will start with those two boys at stanford
6840787 they have amassed more information about people in 10 years than all the governments of the world put together they make the stasi and the kgb look like the innocent old granny next door this is of immense significance if someone evil took them over they could easily become big brother
6840788 the web is a secular religion at the moment and politicians go to pray at events like the google zeitgeist conference any politician who wants to brand himself as a forward looking person will get himself photographed with the google boys
6840789 they invite politicians into their washington hq to give advice on using google to win re election it is the darling of the democratic party and theres no doubt that a win by obama will strengthen googles position in washington
6840790 google have been very hypocritical they try to place a digital halo around their activities they should be at the forefront of acknowledging that these are the most powerful marketing tools around and there should be safeguards in place google claims its there to provide information but its really there to collect data and provide advertising and they simply cant own up to it
6840791 there is concern about their dominance in online advertising when someone is in such a strong position you have to at least look at it there is also the issue of behaviorally targeted advertising the supply of ads deemed relevant based on the users browsing history which needs a code of conduct
6840792 its a bit like a cross between the stepford wives and logans run lots of happy people in shorts always smiling and nobody over 40 all these bright young graduates playing softball in grounds while having great thoughts

6840794 fashion is clearly still a thriving industry despite the economy more people are searching for the best deals and bargains online rather than traipse the high streets and clearly enjoying themselves whilst doing it

6840804 the timing of the news of this directive coming as it does only days after china confiscated bibles from four americans at kunming international airport and at the height of the olympics highlights chinas disregard for the views of the international community
6840805 it is also a stark reminder of the restrictions facing chinese house churches and the ongoing violations of international standards of human rights in china house church christians are not a threat to the stability of chinese society and it is time that china begins to take its place as a world leader in upholding rather than undermining international standards

6840833 two billionaires used the screening of a documentary in theatres across the united states yesterday to urge the country to come to grips with its staggering debt load warren buffett and pete peterson were at the premiere of the movie i o u s a to add their views to the films message an economic disaster will befall the nation if the federal governments us 53 trillion 73 7 trillion in debts continue to grow but buffett said at a news conference before the movies showing that he doesnt think the countrys financial picture is quite as dire as the filmmakers portray
6840834 when is a profit not a profit the answer would seem simple when its a loss
6840835 but figures emerging from this years results season show that determining whether a company has made a profit how much of a profit or even whether the net profit should be considered at all is not that simple now half way into the reporting season there are examples of grey areas in what a company includes in its bottom line and how far some will go to turn a negative into a positive one of the first this season was new company new zealand farming systems uruguay a spin off of rural services provider pgg wrightson it reported a net profit after tax of us 1 6 million 2 2 million but that was before it took into account a performance fee which it must pay on an annual basis to its manager and key shareholder pgg wrightson that fee was us 13 6 million effectively giving the company a net loss of us 12 million but the loss was never spelled out in its commentary
6840836 when is a profit not a profit the answer would seem simple when its a loss
6840837 the biggest negative as far as the major retail new zealand banks are concerned is their exposure to the distressed housing market these exposures are anz national with 47 per cent of its total assets in residential mortgages asb bank with 61 per cent bank of new zealand with 40 per cent kiwibank with 73 per cent westpac with 62 per cent a further deterioration in the housing market will impact new zealand earnings but the more important consideration is the strength of their australian parents in this regard the news is much better across the tasman because the housing market is more buoyant and the four major banks have a total sharemarket value of nearly a 155 billion 189 5 billion even after their recent share price weaknesses another important point to note is that bank failures in the united states are more common and do not signal a similar development here because of the us governments deposit insurance scheme all deposits held by an individual with each bank are insured up to us 100 000 139 000 by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic is funded through levies from banks and savings institutions the deposit insurance scheme encourages the establishment of banks because individuals have a strong incentive to diversify their banking exposure once their deposit exceeds us 100 000 and they dont have to worry about the stability of a bank if they have us 100 000 or less on deposit

6840842 we need to dig deep to revive asian hockey and the need of the hour is to select players aged 15 18 years and give them coaching on modern lines
6840843 india had australian legend ric charlesworth as their adviser but they didnt even qualify i think a foreign coach is not an answer because he can take the players to a certain level and that is not enough
6840844 asian style is different but we need to adopt some modern technique and must have a young coach like tahir zaman qamar ibrahim khawaja junaid or kamran ashraf who know the basics of astro turf
6840845 the worst part is that we dont accept our downfall and i remember that officials were saying that we will finish on the victory stand which was an illusion we must admit we are at the lowest ebb of our hockey
6840846 why dont the asian nations unite and counter the european onslaught
6840847 asian teams can beat europeans because we have the skills but now after the beijing olympics we need to improve in all forms of the game
6840848 we felt good and were prepared for the race we were not afraid of germany going ahead at the beginning
6840849 we were physically fit in this final and now we have achieved our goal
6840850 its incredible absolutely incredible the race went 100 percent to plan i need to thank my coach and now i am an olympic champion
6840851 ive had a great season and to finish it up with the most enjoyable race ive ever had is fantastic when you realise youve crossed the line first you dont feel tired
6840852 london is definitely on the cards now dont be surprised to see me in london ready to represent great britain again
6840853 for the first 500m my aim was just to keep the pace with the others then my real race started i knew david cal couldnt keep up with me
6840854 i could have done better ive given my best but i am very sad i was fighting for the gold medal i am not satisfied
6840855 first they borrowed 540 000 from the bank to renovate their home
6840856 you went to borrow 10 000 but the bank said to borrow 50 000
6840857 second set at 1 0 i made some double faults maybe i lost a little bit of confidence and gave him some confidence
6840858 but i think i played really good the whole match and i am happy with how i feel and how im playing
6840859 you know its hard to say surprised because this is what you work for your whole career
6840860 no im not surprised actually ive been working hard and ive been playing well lately this is kind of a little payback for all the hard work
6840861 it was really really tough deuce all the time a lot of break points
6840862 it was tough conditions it was too hot in the beginning of the second set i felt a little dizzy but then i fought till the end
6840863 coaching in the final yesterday it was so good for my heart that so many people are engaged in womens soccer
6840864 if you looked at the quality of the game and the excitement it had everything extra time that game was not only good for the usa but it was good for womens soccer overall
6840865 womens football is improving all the time and its getting tighter and tighter so now you have a handful of teams that can win the olympics and the world cup and thats really good for womens soccer overall
6840866 things are going to happen we are going to get beat every once in a while by these guys they are just way too good but we knew that we couldnt get down on ourselves and i think that confidence throughout all our games got us to where we are now
6840867 over a period of time the haryana players have been making a special place for them selves at the national and international level despite the obstructions and anti sports polices of the state government
6840868 the massive form of twisting geometric shapes and colours attracts just about everyone who sees it it is visually interesting and it becomes the centrepiece for meeting and conversation but that is not at the expense of the function of bloqx because of this harmony between form and function bloqx has initially been one of the most popular products we have ever shown to architects
6840869 when you reach the top it is the place to see and be seen and meet new friends
6840870 kompan was founded thirty five years ago by an artist who was inspired by children playing on his oversized colorful sculptures in a park bloqx is a perfect example that this approach is still very much at the heart of all of kompan products

6840886 i sent out several r sum s and didnt hear anything back
6840887 what you have experienced is typical dont expect to hear back from organizations most companies dont respond when receiving r sum s
6840888 i would consider this as a rude practice from the candidates point of view but from a companys view its considered quite normal in general companies get hundreds of r sum s every day if they start responding to each and every candidate then they will be spending more time and might mislead from their current job in hand of short listing the right candidate it takes time and effort to respond to each and every candidate
6840889 as an independent consultant i have noticed how much goodness the gesture of a thank you note brings back
6840890 dont take a nonresponse too personally its just routine companies focus their attention on their short list of preferred candidates for those who do not hear back it is understood this means no next step in a perfect world well you know the rest we live in the real world where everyone needs to accept rejection as a frequent part of doing business but that just makes successes all the sweeter good luck
6840891 yes it is normal business practice for most roles and yes it can be considered rude companies are in the business of making money to send a message even just an email costs money its not just the direct cost of sending the message which for an email is so cheap its practically free for a single email but the cost of preparing the message someone has to write it and building the list of people and addresses to send it to bear in mind that not everyone will supply an email address unless its a requirement of the application process then theres a chance you may lay yourself open to complaints of indirect age discrimination so you cant rule out postage costs and that will push up the administrative costs unless the value generated from doing that is greater than the cost its not going to get done for most roles companies of any size will have hundreds if not thousands of applications for most roles its only the higher level roles that applications will be limited to a small number so even if the cost per message is low the total cost could be very high
6840892 another problem hr departments often face is the ever evolving demands of the hiring managers

6840899 when we arrived in denver more than a year ago we promised to make this convention more open and accessible and to bring down the walls of the pepsi center and today we delivered on that commitment in a big way
6840900 were inviting community members to be the first to see the transformation of the pepsi center from sports arena to convention hall and to see where the opening gavel will drop to kick off this historic convention taking steps to open both of our incredible convention venues is our way of saying thank you for all that denver has done to help make this convention special
6840901 many students only get to read about the political process in history books
6840902 but today colorado youth were able to see and experience a piece of history and they were among the first to see the convention hall where we will nominate the next president of the united states

6840905 all questions about the vp selection should be directed to the obama campaign
6840906 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president the second most important question from my perspective is can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally and the third criteria for me i think was independence i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6840907 she was not asked for a single piece of paper she and senator obama have never had a single conversation about it how would he know if shed take it
6840908 cannot imagine that many americans would not consider it a privilege

6840921 there were many tense expeditions when we were in close proximity to soviet submarines and ships
6840922 being on a sub it was constantly impressed upon us who the enemy was there would be little posters reminding us to be quiet if you accidentally closed a hatch or door too hard that sound could actually emit out into the water and give your position away
6840923 for about two weeks we were in the north atlantic in a covert area and it was necessary to remain at periscope depth which is 50 feet under water
6840924 it was hard to stay at that depth without breaking the surface and giving away our position it was extremely tense for those two weeks wed spend six hour watches in the control room just leaning over the steering mechanism with our eyes glued to the gauges as the sub bobbed up and down in the water another time we were discovered by the soviets and had to make a quick getaway
6840925 it was as close to the real thing as we could get
6840926 we had the missile launchers ready and we were all manned up we could go to war at a seconds notice not a minutes notice
6840927 while we were doing it we were using our radar to look into russia but of course we didnt tell them that
6840928 i said were not going out on deck we dont know if theyre shooting or what we checked every missile and it was the only time that ive ever seen the ready to load light steady on the monitor we sat there for a long time and eventually the captain came on and said what happened and to stand down
6840929 you lived under an air of suspicion and intrigue at the same time
6840930 being young soldiers you also had an air of cockiness about you and you felt invincible
6840931 but later i found out that this happened on a regular basis
6840932 you lived your normal life and did your job but you always looked over your shoulder wondering if you were being followed and you had to be careful what you said now as someone thats more stable in life i wonder how we lived through that but back then we loved what we were doing every soldier there was ready to do everything he could to preserve freedom
6840933 for the older georgians who remember the soviet domination i think theyre scared to death that its all going to come back
6840934 everything from communism to the social injustice and tyranny that marked that era it upsets me also because ive seen what its like for three years behind the wall and if you havent lived it you dont know what it is
6840935 regardless of who started the conflict between russia and georgia russia is taking their time to leave
6840936 if youve ever seen the dark shadow of old world communism before the wall fell its scary we had a saying when you went into east berlin you set your watch back 20 years they were that oppressed and a lot of them didnt even realize it
6840937 we had the opportunity to see how the other side lived and i actually enjoyed the experience i think it gives you a different outlook on life you dont take everything for granted and sometimes theres a price to be paid for things its a shame that we have to have it but when somebody threatens your lifestyle theres an opportunity to protect it
6840938 consider his facile observations about president kennedys first meeting with soviet premier nikita khrushchev in vienna in 1961
6840939 its not about our fear its about the people waiting in gaza you cant think about anything else
6840940 if israel chooses to forcibly stop and search our ships we will not forcibly resist
6840941 if we are arrested and brought to israel we will protest and prosecute our kidnapping in the appropriate forums it is our purpose to show the power that ordinary citizens of the world have when they organise together to stand against injustice
6840942 the car went quite deeply into the pub the gentleman driver had been taken ill and i believe it was an automatic vehicle it ricocheted off a couple of cars and then went into the pub
6840943 four other people in the pub were handed over to care of the ambulance service i think they were having a meal
6840944 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6840945 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6840946 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
6840947 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6840948 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6840949 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis

6840970 i think i will probably be someone from probably from the midwest or southeast i think its going to be real important for more to pick up those states
6840971 if the desired assimilation of muslims is to become successful then we have to enmancipate muslim women and that means confronting religious convictions tribal convictions and the way these values are still very much a part of the life of second and third generation immigrants thats what caused not only a conflict between me and the muslim immigrants but also among some of the dutch who had already been themselves well who had adopted the ideas of multiculturalism that it was possible to reconcile tribal islamic values with modern liberal secular values and that problem still goes on
6840972 so some say that the netherlands who have a reputation as being one of the most tolerant countries in the world is even prepared in some cases to tolerate intolerance is that a fair or an unfair characterization
6840973 is is changing but in the 1990s and still in government today the social democrats and a larger group of the christian democrats are devoted to the idea that time will take care of the problem of intolerance as long as that intolerance is perpetrated by minorities islam as a religion has been propagated over and over again to not only the dutch population but i think to all western populations that it is a religion of peace and that there is a small group of people who have perverted the religion and that that fringe group can only be isolated if we continue to spread in my opinion the myth that islam is peace and just give it time there would be intolerance but tolerating that intolerance will eventually kill it and i think that is a great mistake that not only the dutch are making but many european countries are making
6840974 seven years after the 11th of september i cant say whos winning but i hope i wish that we had the same conviction and confidence to fight back now if that happens we can win so easily because muslims millions of muslims want freedom

6841004 the town council has owned the 50 acres of land in trust for the burgess land trust since 1761
6841005 the trust is nowadays a registered charity and it is a requirement that the trust ee which is welshpool town council ensures its assets are used to the best advantage of the charity and the town
6841006 we have decided to sell this land because we want what is best for welshpool the land is worth millions but the government is proposing to introduce land tax which will affect its value substantially
6841007 the money will be invested into projects such as the refurbishment and repair programmes to buildings such as welshpool town hall

6841010 answers to these questions would take us a step closer to the ultimate goal of promoting the brown fat lineage as a potential way of counteracting obesity

6841012 brown fat is derived from muscle that was a huge surprise

6841014 these factors may enhance inflammatory processes and thereby alter upper airway anatomy early in life causing an increased susceptibility for adult snoring
6841015 people who snore run an increased risk of early death and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks or strokes
6841016 these new findings suggest that further knowledge about the early life environment may contribute to the primary prevention of snoring

6841019 our take home message today is that the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery
6841020 wtc 7 collapsed because of fires fueled by office furnishings it did not collapse from explosives or from diesel fuel fires
6841021 it is impossible for a building to fall the way it fell without explosives being involved
6841022 for the first time in history steel was melted by fire it is physically impossible
6841023 this is the first time that we are aware of that a building taller than about 15 stories has collapsed primarily due to fires
6841024 what we found was that uncontrolled building fires similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event the collapse of wtc7
6841025 even without the structural damage wtc 7 would have collapsed from fires
6841026 these uncontrolled fires had characteristics similar to those that have occurred previously in tall buildings
6841027 the fires in wtc 7 would have been controlled and the collapse prevented
6841028 connections that were designed to resist gravity loads but not thermally induced lateral loads
6841029 for the first time we have shown that fire can induce a progressive collapse
6841030 hypothetical blast events did not play a role in the collapse of wtc 7
6841031 found no evidence whose explanation required invocation of a blast event

6841056 if his own wife doesnt trust him with her money why should we trust him with ours teresa heinz kerry is not sure about her husbands character are you
6841057 hes always had a net underneath him throughout his political career in his case a net woven of homespun 24k gold

6841059 john kerry cant really speak to the middle class tax cuts inasmuch as he is a kept man he lives off the money made by other men and left to their daughters or wives
6841060 having a wife who provides you with a private jet and eight multimillion dollar vacation homes provides for a comfortable life but is this the right preparation for becoming president

6841070 like a lot of teachers there now i figured how bad could it be i was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005
6841071 i became very very sick my immune system shut down i collapsed and was bedridden for several months
6841072 i wouldnt have kids in the school if i didnt think it was safe i would close the school
6841073 i do think there are areas of that school that continue to be dangerous
6841074 you can go most anyplace and build a school on top of a superfund site
6841075 they can build a school anywhere they want really and thats the sad truth i think at schools very little has changed and thats unfortunate
6841076 the children would actually pick up these chemicals and handle them
6841077 so for example one of these things was phosphorous rocks phosphorous rocks were little pieces of chemical residue that would bubble up to the surface the children would pick up these phosphorous rocks and when you threw them at a hard surface they would explode like a firecracker
6841078 i have a high school education i dont have a science degree but you dont have to be a scientist to know that 20 000 tons of chemicals and kindergartners dont mix
6841079 the staff and the pupils are fantastic working in difficult conditions and really do deserve better accommodation
6841080 the new build programme will enable the local authority to provide purpose built accommodation meeting the needs of a very vulnerable group of pupils who require additional help and support to develop their skills as successful learners

6841088 statement of the leader of al qaeda in britain sheikh umar rabie al khalaila
6841089 a complete withdrawal of the british troops from afghanistan and iraq
6841090 if the british government fails to respond to our demands by the last day of march 2008 as they fail to answer to the truce of our sheikh osama bin laden then the martyrdom seekers of the organisation of al qaeda in britain will target all the political leaders especially tony blair and gordon brown and we will also target all embassies crusaders centres and their interests through out the country with the help of allah
6841091 finally all praise is to allah umar rabie al khalaila the leader of al qaeda in britain
6841092 british security officials had difficulty assessing the seriousness of the threat which appeared only briefly on al ekhlaas

6841116 once he perpetrated a fraud that goes into his credibility and integrity
6841117 people are upset with the war and stuff whats so bad about bigfoot nobody got hurt
6841118 it got into something much bigger than it was supposed to be
6841119 it started off as just some youtube videos and a web site were all about having fun
6841120 a defense attorney could put him on the stand and say you lied about this how do we know youre not lying now
6841121 i dont believe it does affect my credibility at all because this is bigfoot
6841122 it would be one thing if i came out and said i had something else that is tangible or real but right now as far as im concerned there is no real bigfoot
6841123 if this was a joke it was very methodical and thought out
6841124 not proof of bigfoot we have proof of everything and thats whats gonna come out in the next couple of days

6841131 theres no doubt that there was one thing that the two parties agreed on getting rid of musharraf
6841132 musharraf stepping down at some level closes a chapter for pakistan its the last gate on the way back to democracy but that doesnt mean that democracy will be easier than dictatorship
6841133 the army wants the government to lead and take the political responsibility for going after the extremists so that the armys present unpopularity does not get worse
6841134 but mr sharif has no intention to become the cats paw of the army while mr zardari so far cannot hammer out a common coalition position
6841135 wants no concessions to the army and offers no support to the war against taliban extremists aware of his right wing vote bank he has little time for american demands
6841136 we have to also be offering a long term partnership with pakistan pakistani leaders suspect that if we succeed with al qaeda we will pull away from pakistan
6841137 weve done little to assure them that we see something beyond this very focused effort on terrorism
6841138 there is no escape from the fact that pakistan will be better off with a civilian government than a military dictatorship by and large the administration has accepted this
6841139 pakistan will become completely a democracy when there is civilian ownership of the security apparatus and foreign policy
6841140 the real difficulty for the u s is to make sure that with your actions you dont make the fragile civilian government more fragile
6841141 as he invoked a faulty memory more than 50 times

6841152 we talked about me moving in with you guys they felt bad for me haha
6841153 i told you too much testosterone but i think they will come over more often now that they know there is another girl there to save them from all your macho manliness if thats what you want to call it
6841154 you have to be joking its like a bachelor pad in there you have a whole room devoted to your game systems and a years worth of dirty laundry in the hamper there is nothing girly about that place nothing

6841185 young women tend to express egalitarian values and dislike the traditionalism and hierarchies they imagine are integral to the church

6841252 ganar contra estados unidos no s lo nos permite estar en la final sino que tambi n dejamos claro que fuimos superiores
6841253 corea ha demostrado que es un buen equipo pero nosotros vamos a salir a hacer mejor que nunca las cosas en el partido que ser crucial para ambos
6841254 estuvimos en el partido pero nuestro pitcheo fue sorprendido con el mejor de su bateo oportuno en el momento decisivos y ah se rompi la igualdad
6841255 ahora hay que pensar en el partido de ma ana s bado por la medalla de bronce y olvidarse de este
6841256 todos sabemos que es lo que siempre hacen y que no es la primera vez pero que son cosas que en nuestro pa s no est n permitidas
6841257 ahora todo acab y hay que pensar en el partido de ma ana
6841258 son un gran grupo de j venes peloteros y estoy seguro de que lucharan al m ximo por conseguir la medalla de bronce
6841259 sasser is a leader because our people want to follow him
6841260 a person of character who is skilled in influencing and inspiring others to enthusiastically contribute their hearts minds and other resources toward goals identified as being for the common good
6841261 accept the fact that you are accepted despite the fact that you are unacceptable
6841262 every educator should constantly ask himself whether he is actually fulfilling his teachings in his own person and in his own life to the best of his knowledge and with a clear conscience psychotherapy has taught us that in the final reckoning it is not knowledge and not technical skill that has a curative effect but the personality of the doctor and it is the same with education it presupposes self education
6841263 the principle task of civilisation its actual raison detre is to defend us against nature
6841264 what is characteristic of illusions is that they are derived from human wishes in this sense they come close to psychiatric delusions
6841265 religion would thus be the universal obsessional neurosis of humanity
6841266 is an instinctive attitude peculiar to man and its manifestations can be followed all through human history
6841267 the term religion designates the attitude peculiar to a consciousness which has been changed by experience of the numinosum
6841268 the self is made manifest in the opposites and in conflict between them hence the way to self begins with conflict
6841269 i have frequently seen people become neurotic when they content themselves with inadequate or wrong answers to the questions of life
6841270 beauty is truth truth beauty that is all ye know on earth and all ye need to know
6841271 god is the name by which i designate all things which cross my wilful path violently and recklessly all things which upset my subjective views plans and intentions and change the course of my life for better or worse
6841272 the unrelated human being lacks wholeness for he can achieve wholes only through the soul and the soul cannot exist without its other side which is always found in a
6841273 i do not of course mean that the synthesis or identification of 2 individuals but the conscious union of the ego with everything that has been projected into the
6841274 if i accept the fact that god loves me unconditionally i dont need to look to others for affirmation
6841275 your life is in time but your immortality is in eternity
6841276 i will truly miss the girls but this has been a vision of mine for the last seven years and its finally going to the big screen it is the evolution of music theatre and performance
6841277 imagine a rock n roll version of cirque du soleil which is a musically driven theater show with specialty acts comprised of incredible talent
6841278 its all about what id like to ask him tell me how to set that up a meeting with bush and i would be there in a heartbeat
6841279 mr president are you aware our flesh and blood is dying over there when the coffins come back do you care when only the poor kids die is it fair dont get me wrong i respect the flag but it hurts to see a kid in a body bag he fought for his country with all he had now we have a family without a dad
6841280 creo que hay dos o tres zonas en las que es posible adelantar
6841281 unos han preparado mejor esta prueba que otros debido a que s lo ha sido posible hacerlo a trav s de simuladores creo que es una pista extraordinaria muy r pida pero con buenas escapatorias y me parece incre ble que se haya podido construir en s lo unos meses
6841282 hay rectas muy largas y frenadas exigentes es un trazado en el que me siento bien creo que incluso hay posibilidades de adelantar en dos o quiz tres zonas aunque lo m s importante ser no cometer errores
6841283 las reglas son claras no creo que sea una zona peligrosa aunque s delicada
6841284 no soy un gran aficionado a los nombres de las curvas ya que siempre es m s complicado memorizarlos y hablar con los ingenieros
6841285 hemos entendido completamente lo que sucedi en septiembre daremos informaci n relevante sobre este asunto al resto de equipos

6841292 it took me two years to put this album together
6841293 on my last couple of albums i was off i wasnt analyzing what i was doing exactly i was making movies and music but i couldnt play two sports at the same time i turned down eight movies this time around it was fulfilling for me especially since its my last album under contract i just couldnt jerk myself or my culture
6841294 its okay if you call it a comeback and let them know im ready for combat tell those dumb motherf ckers to fall back
6841295 my style cant be defined ill be relevant forever get it through your mind
6841296 if hes so hot why is the culture frozen its more than champagne im the foundation
6841297 el presidente mendoza no ha sabido valorarme como merec a y me marcho del club no s lo por no llegar a un acuerdo econ mico sino tambi n por otras cuestiones m s importantes
6841298 acabo un ciclo que hay que respetar y comienzo otro
6841299 las estrellas de la grandes ligas no jugar n como ol mpicos
6841300 hemos realizado un gran trabajo con los j venes valores en los torneos del campeonato del mundo y la fase de clasificaci n para los juegos ol mpicos
6841301 es muy diferente la competici n internacional del b isbol de las grandes ligas que se trata de un deporte pero tambi n un negocio muy importante
6841302 estoy convencido que aunque se pudiese seleccionar a los jugadores los equipos no los iban a dejar participar en unos juegos ol mpicos
6841303 me gustar a ver si las estrellas de la nba podr an formar parte del equipo nacional de baloncesto si los juegos ol mpicos se diesen durante la competici n regular de liga o en la fase final
6841304 me parecer a algo incre ble si los equipos le permitiesen la participaci n
6841305 its not my fault that she only has 20 000 to her name im a professional business manager i have a staff of more than a dozen i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
6841306 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market
6841307 50 and his attorneys met yesterday with suffolk county authorities regarding the fire that destroyed 50s house
6841308 the meeting had been arranged weeks ago 50 is eager to review the findings of the investigation when it is concluded
6841309 i fought back and this is what he is trying to do kill me and his own child
6841310 he threatened me he told me he would have someone come do something to me he said i will have someone come kill you and that is what he did
6841311 republishing repeating distributing and otherwise disseminating the defamatory statements and the accusations that plaintiff was involved in burning down the home or attempting to kill family members including his son
6841312 afortunadamente los otros resultados nos favorecieron conseguimos mantener nuestra ventaja y por eso quedamos con la obligaci n de vencer el partido ante el n utico
6841313 tambi n dije que bamos a conseguir muchas carreras y as fue a pesar del gran equipo que es estados unidos y su pitcheo
6841314 lo m s importante no era el margen de carreras que conseguimos sino que jugamos un buen partido y adem s conseguimos la victoria
6841315 lazo es un buen lanzador y jugar ma ana pero como es l gico tendremos que analizar con toda la historia pasada del pitcheo contra corea del sur para determinar quien puede ser el abridor y la estrategia a seguir
6841316 frente a jap n en la semifinal demostraron que est n bien preparados y lo mismo suceder ma ana
6841317 ambos estaremos listos pero si tienen un lanzador que mantenga el control ser complicado hacerles carreras y al final el mejor preparado ser el que se lleve la victoria
6841318 estos tres d as en una casa de la calle d mine
6841319 non un momento molto appropiato per questo fatto triste che successo ma sono contento di essere venuto in una grande societ come la roma e di essere stato accolto bene da questa societ e da questa tifoseria
6841320 sono arrivato in buone condizioni e ovvio che se lallenatore decider di farmi giocare io sar pronto personalmente sono tornato con la rabbia giusta per dimostrare il mio valore personale e professionale
6841321 penso che qui ci sono dei grandi giocatori io sar uno in pi per cercare di lottare per tutti i traguardi
6841322 non lo so spero che siano tanti la cosa pi importante stare attento a non infortunarsi
6841323 la champions league una competizione molto difficile nella quale non ci si pu permettere di sbagliare se facciamo un lavoro come stato fatto lo scorso anno potremmo arrivare in finale
6841324 si pnso che quando un calciatore decide di cambiare pensa di cambiare in meglio questa sarebbe stata la squadra che mi avrebbe aiutato e restare in nazionale e anche i molti nazionali brasiliani hanno contribuito
6841325 sono stato conosciuto fuori dal brasile giocando al siviglia come seconda punta e questa la mia posizione spero che alla roma venga riconosciuta dallallenatore questa posizione
6841326 nel real madrid giocando a centrocampo e dovendo difendere non riuscivo a sfruttare le mie qualit tecniche di sicuro qui potr esprimermi al meglio da attaccante
6841327 non c molto da parlare una finale sempre una finale la motivazione sempre diversa e al massimo
6841328 infatti sono uscito da due grandi stagioni dal siviglia cambiando ruolo non sono pi riuscito ad esprimermi ai miei livelli
6841329 in spagna anche in italia non c una connotazione di animale cattivo soprattutto il mio fisico stato determinante per questo nomignolo
6841330 in italia c grande competitivit ci sono 4 5 squadre che possono lottare per lo scudetto tra questa la roma la juve il milan e linter
6841331 sono una persona normale come tutti mi piace andare al cinema a cena fuori conoscere cose nuove che mi possono arricchire
6841332 e vero che tutte le partite vanno vinte indipendentemente da chi segna se segnassi io sarei felicissimo
6841333 quando stai in unaltra squadra nopresidente sensi che sensazione hai provato in quel momento
6841334 e una situazione complicata difficile parlare e una situazione triste spero che la squadra gli possa regalare tante soddisfazioni e che lui ci possa guidare da dove sta
6841335 haha your very funny no actually i was singing one of your songs smarty pants
6841336 ok ok lanie do you want to make some tea with me
6841337 alright mate why were you two holding hands tell me now i have been dieing to know since i saw you two
6841338 well when you were with him you were holding his hand and he couldnt take his eyes off you dont tell me your not dating
6841339 well we dated in l a but that was a really long time ago i dont know what we are right now do we look like we are dating
6841340 if i didnt know any better i would say you have been dating for years the way he was looking at you was incredible he was only focused on you his eyes only left you when the absolutely had to did you not notice
6841341 i honestly didnt so you think he still cares about me
6841342 duh its obvious well at least to danny and i
6841343 oh i was just curious you two seem like you have been together for a good bit of time
6841344 yep three years its weird because it doesnt fell that long
6841345 because silly you promised you would help me paint now lets go its eleven in the morning
6841346 uh you can paint the last wall the blue color
6841347 en estos momentos nuestra misi n es dar un coche competitivo a fernando alonso para este a o y el que viene
6841348 en primer lugar debemos saber con certeza si es segura ya que tenemos la responsabilidad sobre el piloto estoy de acuerdo en desarrollar cualquier tipo de tecnolog a pero la nica forma de controlar el coste es la colaboraci n entre todos
6841349 de todas formas mi filosof a es que a la gente no le interesan las cajas de cambios ni las suspensiones que monta cada veh culo sino el espect culo
6841350 nunca pens que estuviese finalizado a tiempo con este resultado no es s lo un circuito urbano sino mucho m s se respira una atm sfera excepcional
6841351 es complicado acomodar a todos los integrantes de los equipos en lugares como silverstone inglaterra o spa b lgica estamos en la direcci n correcta los circuitos de valencia y singapur suponen un espect culo fant stico
6841352 a lot of the men ive loved could be described as emotionally unavailable
6841353 there is a lot of game playing in relationships particularly with men you have two masculine dominant energies colliding
6841354 you can be the most intelligent well read human being but when it comes to matters of the heart or the loins we all become idiots
6841355 you make it sound as if boy george is perching on the edge of your desk this very minute
6841356 in many ways my life has been an open book
6841357 with this show however people will get to see and hear with their own eyes and ears what really goes on in my life and i think theyll come to understand me a little bit better with each episode
6841358 i want you to repeat my childhood wounding i will love you because you are so familiar
6841359 my soul my reality is in the hands of that other
6841360 strictly speaking projection is never made it happens it is simply there in the darkness of anything external to me i find without recognising it as such an interior or psychic life that is my own such projections repeat themselves whenever man tries to explore an empty darkness and involuntarily fills it with living form
6841361 what am i asking of this other that i ought to be doing for myself
6841362 a coward is incapable of exhibiting love it is the prerogative of the brave
6841363 not this person nor any other can ultimately give me what i want only i can
6841364 the projection i cast upon the other this hidden agenda needs to be withdrawn it can be replaced with something richer
6841365 i am not only what happened to me i am also what i choose to become
6841366 there are three basic experiences though which our egocentricity can be changed through suffering through the recognition of a power greater than our own will at work in our lives and by coming to care for someone other than oneself
6841367 where or when have i been here before what previous experience does this feel like what is the analogue
6841368 where in me does this come from what does it hit in my history what does it feel like what hidden source is creating repetitive patterns in my life
6841369 neurotic suffering is an unconscious fraud and has no moral merit as has real suffering
6841370 must be understood ultimately as the suffering of the soul which has not discovered its meaning
6841371 the goal of therapy is to help the patient go beyond intellectualisation and rationalisation and other resistive manoeuvers to the point where he can move into uncharted territory to seek and find the anguish and terror of total realisation and disover that he can survive to know that life can be truly absurd and capricious that one is not omnipotent that without magic as a defense there is pain at times which hurts more than words can describe and after grief and mourning not only for the lost objects of ones fantasies and illusions themselves to be able to live relatively without illusion to know time as a friend as well as an enemy to recognise that happiness is not a condition but an ephemeral and precious experience that if one lives without illusion one must impart meaning to ones life that hope must replace expectations and demands that ativity must replace passivity that realistic hope must be directed towards the expansion and growth of ones potentialities which implies experiencing more richly both sorrow and joy that the gates to that eden of infancy are closed barred by angles with fiery swords that mother is dead forever and ever and ever
6841372 everybodys watching whats going on in beijing right now with the olympics
6841373 los jugadores demostraron que tienen potencial de llegar hasta la selecci n principal pero antes han comprobado que hay que tener esp ritu luchador sobre el terreno de juego para llevar la camiseta brasile a
6841374 estuvieron siempre unidos tanto dentro como fuera del campo y demostraron mucha dignidad
6841375 fue gracias a la buena voluntad y la determinaci n de los jugadores de hacer este trabajo
6841376 la mayor dificultad fue que no tuvimos tiempo para entrenar apenas y corregir algunas cosas pero a n as en seis partidos hicimos 14 goles
6841377 a las tres de la ma ana de la noche anterior al partido no sab a si pod a contar con todos los jugadores o no
6841378 as que imaginen lo que pasamos aqu para llegar a este momento el bronce imaginen lo que vale este grupo
6841379 no ten a presi n ni responsabilidades como ahora s lo hab a que jugar
6841380 demuestra que en poco tiempo tuvimos un grupo maduro que sabe lo que desea
6841381 por todo eso esta medalla de bronce tiene mucho valor
6841382 despu s de cuatro meses sin jugar hizo una preparaci n en 15 d as
6841383 a veces un atleta no es tan importante en s sino por lo que representa para todo un grupo
6841384 y nuestra intenci n de traerlo no era s lo para los jjoo sino para hacerle un seguimiento en la selecci n brasile a y l respondi perfectamente
6841385 mi idea principal siempre es la de ayudar a los ni os ense arles a trav s de las partidas y transmitirles un mayor inter s por un deporte que est demostrado que es muy importante en la formaci n de los menores
6841386 esto nos anima a seguir con estos actos compagin ndolos con la competici n porque forman parte importante de la formaci n
6841387 illiteracy as the cultural artefact of those who would oppress
6841388 while all development is modernisation not all modernisation is development
6841389 more and more use of intellectual and less and less of emotional and instinctive functions
6841390 the individual capacity to grasp the order in change and the unity in variety
6841391 be brought about not only with the assent of the people but by their hand
6841392 in a society in which the main changes are to be brought about through collective deliberation and in which re evaluations should be based upon intellectual insight and consent a completely new system of education would be necessary one which would focus its main energies on the development of our intellectual powers and bring about a frame of mind which can bear the burden of scepticism and which does not panic when many of the thought habits are doomed to vanish
6841393 i tell you the truth anyone who has faith in me will do what i have been doing
6841394 during those days i was one of the few ones conducting miracle crusades now every sunday all over the world there are people coming to the lord people receiving healing
6841395 lord i pray that i will not be lukewarm but be part of your move
6841396 lo que me queda es el car cter de mis jugadores
6841397 lo intentamos todo y lo que me queda es el car cter de mis jugadores que juegan hasta las ltimas consecuencias y me siento muy orgulloso de ellos
6841398 si ya es dif cil jugar contra eeuu que tienen t cnica capacidad f sica solidaridad y mucha disciplina eso unido a los 19 puntos de desventaja nos llev a hacer un sobresfuerzo y pagamos las consecuencias en el ltimo cuarto
6841399 demostramos que queremos representar a nuestro pa s y dejar alta la imagen de argentina no nos llevamos el partido pero s obtuvimos una victoria moral
6841400 la rodilla est muy inflamada lo cual no es lo mejor para hacer una exploraci n pero se le ha hecho de todas formas y se puede confirmar que tiene roto el ligamento cruzado anterior y que los cuernos posteriores de los meniscos est n tocados quiz s s lo en una peque a proporci n aunque ser necesaria una nueva exploraci n mediante artroscopia para poder confirmarlo
6841401 tanto el ligamento colateral interno y como externo sufren un esguince de grado 1 2
6841402 aparentemente no hay ninguna otra estructura da ada aunque hay que esperar a que baje la inflamaci n para tener una valoraci n m s exacta de esta lesi n

6841405 ir m s r pido ma ana con pocos cambios
6841406 si se tiene en cuenta la suciedad de la pista creo que hemos realizado un buen inicio de competici n esta ma ana y creo que seremos capaces ma ana de ir m s r pido sin cambiar demasiadas cosas en la segunda sesi n nuestros ajustes fueron buenos pero hubo m s tr fico en la pista
6841407 um fil sofo um homem que experimenta v ouve suspeita espera e sonha constantemente coisas extraordin rias que atingido pelos pr prios pensamentos como se eles viessem de fora de cima e de baixo como por uma esp cie de acontecimentos e de fa scas de que s ele pode ser alvo que talvez ele pr prio uma trovoada prenhe de rel mpagos novos um homem fatal em torno do qual sempre ribomba e rola e rebenta e se passam coisas inquietantes

6841409 no queremos que nuestro pueblo nuestros adolescentes est n mal influenciado
6841410 est teniendo sensaciones nuevas y emocionantes diferentes a las de cualquier otro circuito
6841411 me gusta el ltimo sector hay varias frenadas con inercia lateral en las que te mueves del asiento dentro del habit culo son sensaciones que no se dan en ning n otro sitio
6841412 el coche cambia por completo con o sin gasolina factores decisivos como la adherencia o la estabilidad en las frenadas se modifican enormemente la confianza en los frenos ser fundamental ma ana en la clasificaci n es muy dif cil hacer una vuelta perfecta
6841413 cada vez que hemos entrado en pista hab a m s goma en el asfalto y m s grip adherencia que en la anterior
6841414 estos primeros d as de competici n en un circuito nuevo son complicados para todos la pista es buena aunque hay que encontrar los puntos clave cuanto antes hay sectores en los que hay que estar muy concentrado este no es un circuito urbano al uso sino que tiene algo m s
6841415 estamos evolucionando carrera tras carrera creo que actualmente estamos en disposici n de estar entre los seis primeros en la clasificaci n y mantenernos en los puntos en la carrera la victoria creo que es imposible pero espero que este fin de semana suponga un paso adelante para nosotros
6841416 no podemos olvidar que cuando empec a ganar carreras ninguna televisi n nacional daba en directo las carreras mientras que ahora incluso se retransmiten los test de invierno ha habido un gran cambio en todo el pa s yo estoy en medio de todo esto y estoy feliz
6841417 no creo que sea una zona conflictiva ni peligrosa porque si te mantienes a la derecha hay buen acceso al pit lane adem s los veh culos que vayan por delante de ti tienen espacio para frenar un poco m s tarde de modo que no molestan hoy he pisado la l nea y he cometido un error
6841418 no hay nada no he estado hablando con nadie ya que no es el momento para eso ahora mismo estoy concentrado al m ximo en la presente temporada
6841419 way back last month i made a post entitled blogger video uploading coming soon where i pointed out some scripts that hinted at blogger handling uploading of videos in the post editor to be coming well it hasnt happened yet but it must be getting clo

6841423 it doesnt happen too much anymore we still use it for blacks
6841424 if anyone is never at fault in what he says he is a perfect man able to keep his whole body in check
6841425 it isnt the size of the dog in the fight its the size of the fight in the dog
6841426 its aint about how hard you hit its about how hard you can get hit and keep moving foward
6841427 theres no shame in going into a fight and getting your ass kicked but theres no honor in not fighting at all who wants to fight
6841428 by day the lord directs his love at night his song is with me a prayer to the god of my life

6841430 theyre looking for help obviously and the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector
6841431 russian security officials threatened retaliation against georgia including eight different aerial drones
6841432 we asked israel not to sell offensive weapons to a hostile neighboring state but they said theyre a sovereign state
6841433 well israel shouldnt be surprised if we sell offensive weapons to israels neighbors
6841434 russia today tv reports syrian president will allow russia to place anti aircraft weaponry in syria in response to us planting of missiles in poland bashar assad has made an offer to his russian counterpart dmitry medvedev allowing the latter to counter the uss involvement in poland by planting russian missiles on syrian soil russia today tv reported thursday
6841435 transportation minister shaul mofaz kadima on friday mofaz accused syria and other regional states of
6841436 mofaz also responded to allegations that syria offered to place russian missile batteries on their soil saying
6841437 nevertheless israel fears assad is trying to drag russia and israel into a new diplomatic crisis by emphasizing israeli arms sales to georgia
6841438 syria raised the prospect yesterday of having russian missiles on its soil sparking fears of a new cold war in the middle east
6841439 we are ready to co operate with russia in any project that can strengthen this is very important because if israel desides to hit syria and takes out those russian missiles it could fufill isaiah 17 1 and cause the start of ezekiel 38
6841440 it is a mutual interest of russia of israel and of the pragmatic leaders and states in the region not to send long range missiles to syria
6841441 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
6841442 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6841443 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6841444 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis
6841445 the dollar got pounded yesterday and everybody rushed to buy commodities as a safe haven now the dollar is strengthening so everybodys dumping commodities again
6841446 obviously yesterdays rally was overcooked and were simply taking back some of that speculative risk premium we injected into the market
6841447 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6841448 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat

6841461 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6841462 and one of the most important realities of today is that the concept of two states is now confused by the people
6841463 the people want two states now and for this reason they do not support the solution

6841586 was the only candidate to immediately release a tough statement criticizing the fisa bills approval
6841587 ive opposed fisa for a long time and have said so even prior to written statements ive done it in speaking engagements ive done it repeatedly retroactive immunity is absolutely unacceptable im sorry if people have a hard time navigating my website but it was press released and thats just the way it goes
6841588 ive got the support of the humans right campaign ive got the support of planned parenthood and naral i have ten years in the state legislature in alaska eight as a democratic leader and every single social issue that came up i fought hard for and fought on the right side of and so ive got a track record that has been battle tested and proven and any insinuation to the contrary is just its just campaign tactics and its just inaccurate the one other thing that i think is important to note is ive been right out front talking about the need to develop renewable energy and address climate change i did it when i was in the state legislature and i did it in the private sector i set up my own renewable energy company so this is something that i know a lot about im passionate about and its been a centerpiece of the campaign
6841589 id say go look at my fcc reports if i have any lobbyists money its from alaskan lobbyists and thats it and what theyre trying to do is draw linkage to the fact that ive had support from members of congress and from their leadership pacs and those leadership pacs i dont go solicit funds from them but to me when you have members of congress support you its an indication that they think youre gonna be an effective voice in congress so i think theyre making a whole lot of something out of nothing and its more in the line of sour grapes than anything else
6841590 ive spent three seasons in the antarctic and that was a pretty important thing as far as giving me personally something to talk about ive commercial fished and ive lived a good alaska life and so i appreciate that diane benson has an interesting life story theres a lot of americans who do shes not the only one

6841593 so pretty much we had to get drunk for three months
6841594 a lot of the vineyards in napa and sonoma realized the significance sideways had for the santa barbara area
6841595 so people were like come see our vineyards and to get rights to a lot of real life characters i had to go drink wine with the vinters
6841596 there were a few occasions where you couldnt turn down someones pride and joy
6841597 they would drink it and spit it out and i wasnt sure if that was allowable or not
6841598 so it got a little rough a couple times at 2 oclock in the afternoon after a couple of bottles of wine
6841599 so we had to research what it was to drink good wine and be around vineyards and vinters and did i mention drinking a lot of really good wine
6841600 she was on set most of the time which was tough because it was harvest season
6841601 and shed say swirl it like this smell it like this down to how youd pick up the dirt and letting it fall through your fingers who would know
6841602 as much as we wanted to take in they were there to give it so it was a crash course in wine
6841603 youve got to remember that theres no real alcohol on set
6841604 i dont think the films insurers would have allowed it and youve got to get in bed in time to wake up early so sorry to disappoint you but i didnt drink
6841605 but that chateau montelena chardonnay is a sensational drop of wine and its the wine that changed the world its buttery and sensual and you can understand the artistry in it other than that a really sublime glass of wine would be a freycinet pinot noir from
6841606 i just finally discovered what the big deal was about
6841607 i always wondered but its not until you have the first glass of really good wine that it opens you up

6841611 the worst that can happen is you end up where you started off the best is you receive what you negotiated
6841612 if you have an offer in hand theres always some meat left on the bone
6841613 know where you are willing to accept something less than what you wanted and where you cannot its rare that you get everything you are negotiating so set your priorities both the employer and you will feel good once the process has ended
6841614 make sure you can justify your needs based on your experience skills and most importantly what you can bring to the table for their company
6841615 if the person is currently employed and generally ok in their role but merely looking for a better opportunity id suggest they aim high and negotiate heavily think of their dream offer and ask for it
6841616 if youre reasonable and present your case well and they dont meet your needs care or understand its an indicator of whats to come

6841618 the flooding experienced in dundee city centre yesterday was the result of an extreme rainstorm coinciding with a high tide this meant that the existing old victorian sewer system was totally unable to cope with the sheer volume of rainwater caused by this flash flood
6841619 the worst affected part of the city was in the dock street area but many other locations around dundee experienced unusual flooding events due to the drains and sewers backing up
6841620 responsibility for the sewage system in dundee lies with scottish water but dundee city council is very concerned about the impact of these ever more frequent flooding incidents on property and the road network
6841621 dundee city council is planning to install a completely new sewer system in dundee waterfront as part of the areas redevelopment the project is seeking to design this system in a way which has enough capacity to resolve the flooding problems being experienced in dock street
6841622 in order to achieve this the council needs the cooperation of scottish water to design and implement a drainage system in the waterfront which not only provides for its redevelopment but also assists the flood affected areas in the city centre to the north we have had dialogue with scottish water on this matter but we need greater commitment from them if we are to grasp this opportunity to tackle the flooding problems in the centre of dundee

6841691 if you think the fact that we have sold in excess of 2 million records and have never been paid a penny is pretty unbelievable well so do we and the fact that emi informed us that not only arent they going to pay us at all but that we are still 1 4 million dollars in debt to them is even crazier that the next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt just makes you start wondering what is going on shouldnt a record company be able to turn a profit from selling that many records or at the very least break even

6841697 but our preliminary analysis shows that the phenomenon can explain the multiple generations of stars seen in the w5 region
6841698 our first look at this region suggests we are looking at one or two generations of stars that were triggered by the massive stars
6841699 we plan to follow up with even more detailed measurements of the stars ages to see if there is a distinct time gap between the stars just inside and outside the rim

6841711 but the more you get away from that the lower down in quality the more youre going to have to pay up
6841712 anyone whos done a merger of one sort or another would like to term out their bank loans because banks are getting tighter in terms of their willingness to lend and terms theyre willing to grant
6841713 higher perceived risk the need to raise additional capital and hefty refunding needs in the near term have combined to push up the rate at which banks can borrow

6841739 we focused on raising awareness of the great firewall of china the state sponsored information filtering apparatus that monitors and controls e mails and web sites within china
6841740 the great firewall is a tool used by the chinese government to stifle grassroots dissent and prevent the freedoms of speech and press u s corporations play a roll in aiding and abetting the implementation of the great firewall of china though the issue is complex it requires substantially more public discussion on how u s information technology is being used to deny 1 3 billion people fundamental rights

6841764 we perform to music and if you have music you have art but today all my muscles ached were completely numb except for the ones in my brain so i dont know how they could kick us out of the olympics
6841765 at the last olympics when davydova was undergoing a doping test someone said but why would you need doping for synchro
6841766 i dont think people understand how hard it is to do what we do they should be put underwater to see how hard it is

6841790 there is no substitute for repetition for studying and practicing basics correctly over and over again period
6841791 at this late date i still find music to be an adventure there are things that i havent done yet i dont want to look at what happened i want to look at whats coming up when i wake up i intuitively ask myself what can i discover today that i didnt know about yesterday that makes it an adventure and jazz is all about improvisation nobody comes to hear the melody chorus after chorus after the melody they want to know what youve got on your mind what is your impression of this tune what feelings do you get from it
6841792 i was in high school and we had a job with one of the local big bands jimmy johnson and his ambassadors
6841793 we walked home and john says you were right ms
6841794 years later were playing at the newport jazz festival and john was in the tent warming up on his soprano he had just recorded my favorite things atlantic 1960 with his quartet and art farmer and i had formed the jazztet suddenly he took the horn out of his mouth and started laughing he said remember what your mother told us well those guys are still in philadelphia and were here
6841795 well cant you break the rules if that helps you accomplish what youre trying to achieve
6841796 the dominant didnt go back to the tonic i went from the sixth to the tonic now everybody knows that tune if the ear accepts it thats it you can iconoclastically set those rules to the side
6841797 but tadd was actually showing me things at the piano he did an arrangement for duke and he let me copy it because i wanted to see what he was doing
6841798 i ran into john on columbia avenue in philly and he told me miles dug it so much that he recorded it miles validated me that got me started as a jazz composer
6841799 so i went to the door and she came in but i really didnt pay attention because it was kind of dark
6841800 when i got off the bandstand i said ive never seen anyone before like you you think i could have your phone number she said well if you want my phone number you can look in the phone book i said to myself she thinks shes cute im not going to bother with her the next morning i was in the phone book then she invited me to her house and i met her mother and others she had friends who would say youre going to take up with a jazz musician most of those people are divorced separated and my wife bobbie and i are still together after 50 years
6841801 a hero out of other people and my name would never be up there i wrote the comedy things over at paramount wrote dramatic stuff mood stuff love themes with a big string section
6841802 but before then man my nest egg was going down like an elevator out of control at that point everything was in the pawnshop my horn cameras bobbies jewelry and furs it took me two years to get started see i had to pay rent i had this house up on a hill a pool the whole back of the house was glass upstairs and downstairs were beautiful i was scared to death but then i started to make the money when things started to roll it was okay

6841807 while my hair was styled for the ceremony i thought of ways to set fire to my wedding dress
6841808 when i protested my dad gagged me and tied me up after the wedding i tried to kill myself twice
6841809 early marriages are universal in yemen because of the cultural premium placed on shaping a young bride to meet the husbands needs
6841810 tribal leaders and imams have more influence than the state but its important to amend our marriage laws to create a benchmark we need a new place to start from
6841811 theres an avalanche of factors working against the girl child we should be on a war footing to save young girls from the inferno of child marriage
6841812 even powerful families arrange alliance marriages by bartering their daughters into the power structures at an early age but girls from the poorest families are most at risk
6841813 the cards are stacked against the girl child and those shuffling the cards dont even understand the risks to their sisters and daughters
6841814 we have to establish a trust to look after the girls interests over the next few years we need to find a model that will work for all victims of early marriage

6841824 strike activity picked up beginning in 1933 peaking in 1937 with a record number of strikes and a number of striking workers second only to the post world war i strike wave of 1919 the success rate of these strikes increased rather dramatically as well from an all time low of 24 percent in 1930 to 37 percent in 1933 and nearly 50 percent in 1935 1936 and 1937 the fruits of these organizing campaigns began to be realized in increased union membership and union density beginning in 1934 by 1937 a record 5 8 million u s workers had joined labor unions and union density 22 had reached unprecedented levels

6841826 when i started polling nevada that was a pretty solidly conservative county the fact that it is tied now means it is a true swing county
6841827 i certainly will endorse barack obama havent done it yet officially but ive always said we have to unite behind the nominee i certainly expect to do an event in the next few weeks

6841833 obamas born alive problem ultimately could prove fatal to the man who thought too hard and lost his sense
6841834 when i started polling nevada that was a pretty solidly conservative county the fact that it is tied now means it is a true swing county
6841835 john mccains been living like this for the last 25 and obviously doesnt have a very clear sense of what ordinary americans are going through
6841836 i suppose if youve got seven maybe eight houses the economy looks fundamentally sound to you
6841837 but if youre having trouble making the mortgage payment then the economy looks awful different
6841838 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6841839 one of his biggest fundraisers helped him buy his million dollar mansion purchasing part of the property he couldnt afford
6841840 i was exhausted to keep plugging away and not fall off it was tough
6841841 cuba are a great team with some great players they hit our pitching mistakes they hit them over the fence
6841842 we could win the gold medal in every single track and field event but if we dont win a single thing in the sprints and relays the public will view our performance as a disaster
6841843 when we drop the baton in back to back relay races the public views our performance as a disaster
6841844 we can be a much better team and we will be
6841845 we will conduct a comprehensive review of all our programs it will include assessments from inside and outside the usatf family
6841846 included in the assessment will be the way in which we select train and coach our relays
6841847 they all say more or less the same thing the dropped batons were reflective of a lack of preparation lack of professionalism and of leadership i agree
6841848 dropping a baton isnt bad luck its bad execution responsibility for the relay debacle lies with many people and many groups from administration to coaches to athletes
6841849 ultimately the athletes on the track are the only ones who can successfully pass the stick around the track but they need proper leadership and preparation
6841850 theres no denying we have had more than our share of bad luck
6841851 the public sometimes sees these things and sees only failure rather than the nature of the games
6841852 when the mens marathon concludes on sunday well still be the worlds number one team in terms of medal count
6841853 in the mens and womens 200 im not sure there was any stopping the jamaican juggernaut at least not when it comes to gold medals
6841854 nobody from any country was going to beat 9 69 and 19 30
6841855 we wont have nearly as many gold medals as weve won the last two world championships and gold is what gets it done
6841856 the perception is that weve managed to muck up several key events some people have taken that key event letdown and applied it somewhat unfairly to the entire team
6841857 if needed we reserve the right to boost these forces
6841858 i do not believe that these actions can seriously contribute to the stabilisation of the situation in the region
6841859 mmm that smells good and it doesnt sting like the other kind

6841868 just the conservative 1 1 billion cost estimate is equivalent to the total funding that oregons public universities will receive from the state in the current biennium or to cutting the salaries of all oregon k 12 public school teachers by 70
6841869 its a scheme slanted heavily in favor of the states wealthiest households most oregonians get nothing but significant cuts to important public services

6841875 basically the labeling of these devices falsely states or implies they will treat impotence prolong erection and increase the dimensions of the penis
6841876 employ weights or lines tied to other parts of the body such as the knee to affect tension on the penis
6841877 those employing a sealing principle in the area of the base of the penis and an evacuation mechanism to drop the atmospheric pressure around the penis thereby affecting increased blood flow
6841878 constrict the base of the penis after erection has been achieved and cause the erection to be maintained by blocking the normal circulation of blood from the penis

6841897 why are drivers now expected to be doctors most people wouldnt know what to do with a first aid kit let alone how to deal with someone whos been hurt in an accident
6841898 it seems that the purpose of the new traffic law is not to dispel the traffic chaos but rather to introduce new fines to swell the resources of the ministry of interior
6841899 i have no idea what to do its not like i can find a new career

6842145 data fiasco firm pa consulting is at heart of 20bn id card scheme fresh questions have been raised over the governments id card project as it emerged that the firm at the centre of the criminal data fiasco is at the heart of the 20bn project
6842146 this was data that was being held in a secure form but was downloaded onto a memory stick by an external contractor
6842147 it runs against the rules set down both for the holding of government data and set down by the external contractor and certainly set down in the contract that we had with the external contractor
6842148 the public will be alarmed that the government is happy to entrust their 20bn id card project to the firm involved in this fiasco at a cost of millions of pounds to the uk taxpayer
6842149 this will destroy any grain of confidence the public still have in this white elephant and reinforce why it could endanger rather than strengthen our security
6842150 jacqui smith cannot continue to abdicate responsibility for this shambles she must at a bare minimum explain how this failure could happen when she first knew about it and what she now intends to do about it why did she sit on this information until it was dragged out by the media when was she intending to tell the public
6842151 if this government cannot keep the data of thousands of guilty people safe why on earth should we give them the data of millions of innocent people in an id card database
6842152 frankly the keystone kops would do a better job running the home office and keeping our data safe than this government
6842153 this represents a gross breach of the privacy of each prisoner whose data is on the stick
6842154 if any of those whose details are on it can show that they came to harm because of their information being in the public domain they could sue the british government for misfeasance of office and for a breach of the data protection act both of which could carry damages
6842155 this shows privatisation of these things hasnt helped we didnt have all these losses of information before the security of data kept by the government needs to be urgently reviewed
6842156 personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly
6842157 this information could provide valuable information to those who may misuse it had the data on the memory stick been encrypted its loss would have posed no risk
6842158 if you hand out memory sticks almost like confetti to companies that are meant to do research for you then you need to be absolutely certain that when you give such information away the company concerned have put into practice procedures that are just as robust as the procedures that i hope the government has followed since the loss of the child benefit discs
6842159 we are collaborating with the home office very closely on this matter and we have no further comment to make
6842160 i should have been established in my faith and ready to fight the battles that life would bring
6842161 but i wasnt i just took life as it happened and never really thought deeply about things my prayer life was a one way street and whenever i tried to read the bible through i would get halfway into genesis and become preoccupied with other things i had learned to trust in myself in my abilities and my family to make life as comfortable as possible
6842162 i really didnt think about hockey or a glamorous lifestyle
6842163 i still believed that i could manage life on my own
6842164 that i could control circumstances and keep everything together id been a christian for years but had never moved beyond my salvation experience into a close personal walk with jesus i had faith in the lord to save me from sin but didnt know him well enough to believe that he could care for all the details of my life
6842165 i started at matthew and as i read somehow my merciful heavenly father gave me a piece of hope to cling to in my darkness
6842166 the lord began to show me what complete surrender was all about galatians 2 20 became a reality i have been crucified with christ and i no longer live but christ lives in me the life i live in the body i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me the lord was growing me up embracing me with his love as i ran into his arms
6842167 i believe there are times when god wants us to walk alone with him and stop looking to everyone else to meet our needs i wanted a doctor or my husband or my parents to give me the answers but the answers were in the word of god the cure was trusting in jesus to carry my burdens and make my load light
6842168 the hardest part of being traded was saying goodbye to those dear friends so abruptly but
6842169 consider it pure joy my brothers whenever you face troubles of many kinds because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete not lacking anything
6842170 i feel like a toddler who has just grown enough to peek up over the edge of the counter god has given me a glimpse of his goodness and power and shown me that he never intended for his children to live as helpless victims of the enemy kevin and i believe god has placed us in the world of professional hockey to share his love and i am eager to see what he will accomplish as we learn to lean on him
6842171 taking every thought captive to the obedience of christ requires moment by moment laying down my agenda in exchange for intimate relationship with my lord
6842172 the challenge is in giving this relationship its rightful place in our full overflowing schedules
6842173 it has been one leap of faith after another as i am continually reminded of my inadequacies and weaknesses but it is an absolute joy and gift to be about my fathers business
6842174 so we are embracing the journey itself passing through the seasons of life where change is required and often difficult
6842175 ill always trust in you so take me lord wherever
6842176 the counselor the holy spirit whom the father will send in my name will teach you all things and will remind you of everything i have said to you peace i leave with you my peace i give you i do not give to you as the world gives do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid

6842178 with the project of finding a voice with language as an instrument of injury and salvation of selfhood and empowerment
6842179 focus on how the characters dialect is empowering and also speech in general is empowering we always trace the motif of speech in the book the ones who can speak and speak freely have the power in the book
6842180 point of view though the novel is narrated in the third person by a narrator who reveals the characters thoughts and motives most of the story is framed as janie telling a story to pheoby the result is a narrator who is not exactly janie but who is abstracted from her janies character resonates in the folksy language and metaphors that the narrator sometimes uses also much of the text relishes in the immediacy of dialogue

6842183 i was really cross with chris after the incident in the first race
6842184 he came up to me to apologise afterwards and you could say it is one of those things that happens but there was no room there for him to try and make a pass
6842185 i focused on getting a finish in the second race as it was important to get to the chequered flag and i enjoyed the final race
6842186 prices are dropping significantly to the point where they will become options in midrange storage systems
6842187 ssd adoption will be measured and deliberate focusing first on market segments that can tolerate the additional premium associated with ssds
6842188 one of its big advantages is that it gives increased performance
6842189 it also offers high reliability due to its physical nature and is more energy efficient as it requires less power
6842190 companies have been using hard disks for decades and ssd is relatively new so enterprises will have to learn about where they best fit in
6842191 at this point ssd products are largely aimed at enterprises looking to maximize performance of large databases and other it assets that benefit from enhanced response times
6842192 it is a specialized solution to specific kinds of problems
6842193 the technology is already going beyond the commerce and trade transaction worlds
6842194 its a certain technology that can do certain things and is proliferating behind where its been the past few years
6842195 consider that our flash based ssd line just came online in early 2007 and oems are already pulling it in
6842196 emc had invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into ssd and has called it a new permanent tier of storage that is not going away
6842197 it has to be an application centric approach and organizations have to ask what problem can they solve using this drive
6842198 the biggest issue is how to help customers understand when and where ssd solutions are ideally applied

6842205 the hypersonic boundary layer data that they were trying to acquire
6842206 we flew a trajectory that anybody else stays away from the dynamic pressures were six fold of what space vehicles normally see
6842207 but we were quite interested in the data that was going to be obtained for future developments
6842208 we dont know exactly what data if any was actually acquired that will be of use for us
6842209 on the basis of the results of analyzing that data we will make a determination as to if this needs to be tried again or not
6842210 his blend of off the charts athleticism and long range shooting ability is rare especially for someone his age we believe his best basketball is still to come
6842211 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
6842212 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6842213 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6842214 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6842215 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6842216 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6842217 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6842218 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6842219 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6842220 if you trust every web site but not a government
6842221 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official is it possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6842222 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6842223 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6842224 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6842225 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6842226 jesus this guy is a fucking idiot i can put anything over on this fool

6842229 unknown political risk and constant negative headlines are not likely to induce investors to buy
6842230 we were concerned that the declining oil price and the mechel case would put pressure on the margins of companies and hence their earnings
6842231 foreigners are selling out bonds which is seen from bigger spreads and stocks which is clear from declining benchmarks
6842232 while many investors were plainly shocked by the escalation of the conflict with georgia we think that those bold enough to increase their russia exposure at this time of perceived elevated political risk may be rewarded
6842233 although volatility can be unwelcome in the short term it is precisely at times such as this that active managers can take advantage of market inefficiencies
6842234 we believe the long term investment case for russia is compelling
6842235 theyre looking for help obviously and the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector
6842236 this is a man proud happy and satisfied with his life
6842237 the increasing availability of single serve and multi packs may not serve consumers in the long run but because they are considered to be innocent pleasures may turn out to be sneaky small sins
6842238 maybe the answer lies in consumers taking responsibility for their consumption and monitoring internal cues of sufficiency rather than letting package size take control
6842239 oh yeah we got that box did you make those
6842240 hhhhhhh mom i suppose my big butt is going to appear now on your blog
6842241 what do you mean you want more space for the library
6842242 the storm is here it wasnt as hot as we wanted but who knows theres a storm going through florida you have to practice against every atmosphere
6842243 im real concerned about farmer going down hes very valuable to our team and im anxious to see what his situation is with his knee hes valuable on all special teams and hes a great fullback
6842244 you can never be satisfied with where youre at you just try to get better than you were the day before im never satisfied i just have to keep working hard and keep pushing myself
6842245 jake heun who was projected to serve as a power back has not practiced since the first day of training camp when he suffered a herniated disc
6842246 what happened to dave farmer is very unfortunate its very disappointing
6842247 in yesterdays 53 play scrimmage the defense dominated intercepting three passes cornerback ryan mouton and outside linebacker r j kiesel kauhane each parlayed an interception into a return for a touchdown
6842248 i saw the ball caught it and made a play
6842249 mcmackin praised the defense and was forgiving of the offenses collective struggles of the nine possessions only one ended in an offensive touchdown a 4 yard pass from backup greg alexander to slotback michael washington no 1 quarterback brent rausch directed a 57 yard drive that ended with dan kellys 35 yard field goal
6842250 i thought the defense played well they made some big plays the offense got some plays but we werent as consistent as we want to be well have to keep improving we have to continue to get reps and continue to improve
6842251 the good thing again is we really worked the 40 second clock the operation is good we got the kicking game into it too
6842252 it simulated a fourth of what the game in florida will be like i think the sound helped our quarterbacks a little bit
6842253 every step we take as long as its forward is a good step i think we had some good steps forward anything forward is a positive for us
6842254 kia has more experience and hes healthier pepa is still banged up but hes getting better he still has to clean up some technique to get that spot but hell still compete theyre both going to play
6842255 the warriors yesterday unveiled their new haa at the end of practice two of safety keao monteilhs friends aka and keala offered late night lessons to the players
6842256 they went to hawaiian immersion schools since they were small
6842257 this haa is more dramatic than the one the warriors performed last year
6842258 the reason he would always win was because he would psych up his warriors they taught it to us because were the warriors
6842259 i thought there were some real big plays on defense and we scored a couple of times but we just cant give up turnovers we gave up four a game last year six against georgia in the sugar bowl and you cant win when you turn the ball over
6842260 the defense tried to set the tempo and we had a good day especially being here at the stadium we wanted to make it like a game day were going to play like a game day we dont want anybody to move the ball on us
6842261 it adds a little but itll be three or four times louder than what it was today but it gave the offense a little taste of what its going to be like
6842262 it was a rough day for the warriors quarterbacks as sophomore brent rausch went 7 for 16 with two interceptions greg alexander went 10 for 19 for 91 yards with a pick working against the second team defense he led the offense to its lone touchdown of the scrimmage period a 4 yard dart to mike washington inoke funaki ran two series going 3 for 5
6842263 the defense did well we just kind of struggled its good because this is game type stuff
6842264 we need to run eight nine 10 plays without making mistakes thats the key we had several opportunities where we moved the ball but we had breakdowns we made mistakes on the routes we broke down on the protection it wasnt as consistent as we need to be but we had something going and we just didnt finish it was a combination of stuff weve got a lot of new people and we just have to keep getting better and be smart

6842300 some of that strength in grain prices earlier this year was for real
6842301 as we go into the fall we know for example that the price of natural gas is going to go up an average of 20 per cent
6842302 for a family that means about a 260 a year increase which when looked at in grocery terms that s two or three weeks of groceries
6842303 it s going to be quite difficult in the coming months in terms of their ability to put food on the table and to have a standard of living that is necessary
6842304 the rising price of gasoline energy food as well as tough economic times they re coming together in a gathering storm
6842305 puts a few more steps into shopping looking around seeing what is the best bargain out there that s all you can do
6842306 hopefully the gas prices will level out a bit for the coming winter because that s always a problem too you can t get around as well
6842307 i ve definitely rearranged what i buy where i buy and how i buy and i can t afford to drive the way i used to
6842308 public transit can be a blessing sometimes not as convenient but you do what you have to do
6842309 we re starting to see the leading edge of the storm
6842310 we do some work in first nations community sandy lake located about 700 kilometres northwest of thunder bay
6842311 gas prices are even higher there 1 70 a litre it just absolutely and ultimately reduces your mobility
6842312 given there s already high rates of poverty we re extremely worried about conditions in communities in northwestern ontario
6842313 the north and rural regions certainly are finding it difficult
6842314 the people coming in that can t pay their hydro bills and their gas bills and so they re being shut off is increasing if you can t pay that you can t get food

6842323 the chinese government has become more confident because of a successful olympics that helps the liberal wing of the leaders they will argue that we should not be so scared of the international media and international integration and also to a certain extent openness or transparency
6842324 after the olympics the reform effort that has been stalled by the pressures of hosting a major international event could be restarted
6842325 if those freedoms can be extended to chinese journalists that could be one of the positive results of the games
6842326 im disappointed but not surprised by the not very substantial measures that the chinese took to remain in line with their commitments for the olympic games
6842327 china was trying to send a message to the outside world that it was willing to take measures to open up but internally the main concern was preserving stability and i dont think that after the games that will change so much
6842328 theyll keep most of the things in place certainly the harassment of the dissidents and we wont see any kind of greater move towards liberalization or opening up or anything like that
6842329 did this change chinas view in the world is this a turning point no it will just reinforce your sense of a party thats completely insecure and lacking a great deal of confidence
6842330 im sorry your blue im sorry about all the things i said to you

6842337 i think that you are going to see some exciting players
6842338 you are going to see some exciting futures youre going to know that there is a lot of potential and yet you will see that we are not perfect you will see some areas that still need work it helps us put them in front of fans get out some of that nervous energy so when we get to oklahoma it will feel like we will have been in a match
6842339 we lost four really good seniors but we have a really good recruiting class coming in this year
6842340 we have been working hard in two a days and it is interesting in the preseason because we started to pull things together earlier like playing six on six right away so we are really excited to see whats going to happen this season
6842341 unknown political risk and constant negative headlines are not likely to induce investors to buy
6842342 we were concerned that the declining oil price and the mechel case would put pressure on the margins of companies and hence their earnings
6842343 foreigners are selling out bonds which is seen from bigger spreads and stocks which is clear from declining benchmarks
6842344 while many investors were plainly shocked by the escalation of the conflict with georgia we think that those bold enough to increase their russia exposure at this time of perceived elevated political risk may be rewarded
6842345 although volatility can be unwelcome in the short term it is precisely at times such as this that active managers can take advantage of market inefficiencies
6842346 we believe the long term investment case for russia is compelling

6842351 for the fourth time we got a medal for brazil in the olympics and we are very happy about it

6842353 we didnt get to the final but in the end we won the bronze which is also important
6842354 ronaldinho is very important player to the team he didnt prepare for the tournament for the entire four months he only trained with the team for 15 days

6842393 there will be future talks i have appealed to the opposition to have peaceful demonstrations
6842394 we would have to make a move despite whatever investments had been already made in the project
6842395 this tatas withdrawing will create problems for the state not only in the present but also for future in attracting investment
6842396 committed to bring investment into a state which had attracted little investor attention
6842397 small car is a world story it is an issue of the countrys image
6842398 irreversibly hamper the future industrialisation of the state and could take it back to an age of industrial vacuum
6842399 back to the 1970s when the state witnessed large exodus of industry
6842400 we are deeply concerned at the violence and disruption and at the safety of our employees equipment and investments at the project site at singur
6842401 it is for the people of west bengal and kolkata to decide whether we are unwanted or accept us as a good corporate citizen
6842402 following which we would have to make a move despite whatever investments had been already made in the project
6842403 there is a sense of tension violence and disruption at singur obviously it is not a conducive atmosphere the compound wall is broken down materials stolen
6842404 whatever be the cost we will move out if the situation demands so
6842405 we are extremely sensitive to the needs of the rural community we have not come to exploit anyone we have got the land on lease and not bought it
6842406 despite much flak which we have drawn for locating the dream project at singur we have decided to locate the project here
6842407 we are also gifting a hospital to the state which would be commissioned in march 2009
6842408 it is necessary to incorporate the ancillary units in the same location to keep the logistics cost low
6842409 let the company take whatever land it wants for its 600 acre factory and only after that will the farmers who have not accepted compensation take back their land i am not insisting on return of the exact land
6842410 we plan to channelise about 50 lakh tonnes lt of wheat under the scheme between september and march next another 10 lt will be allocated to states uts as additional above poverty line apl quota
6842411 the unified access licence are authorised to provide triple play voice data and video without any limit on speed of data 3g service providers are not new category of licensees and they shall be offering 3g services under terms amp conditions of the uasl licence therefore the provision of the trai act 1997 is not applicable in this situation
6842412 while a aaa rated corporate can get loans at plr or even 1 1 5 per cent lower than plr lending to sme is usually never lower than plr
6842413 ancillary businesses such as letter of credits and guarantee from sme clients give banks an opportunity to earn fee based income
6842414 gems and jewellery auto components engineering and textiles are the sectors our bank will be focusing in a big way this year
6842415 for smes there is no other capital available they have to go in only for loan capital
6842416 sme is a segment of high growth so our focus on this segment will remain but because of the overall slowdown new investments could be lesser this year
6842417 there has been no trial and unless this is done no one can be seen as guilty of abetment of suicide this is clearly an emotional judgment
6842418 industrialists should have a human face and show concern for the people
6842419 the trinamul congress chairperson had cited a letter at the meeting with industrialists since we were not aware of anything i enquired about it with mr kant he gave us details of the land use which includes the land for ancillary units
6842420 we have already given the documents to them but again if they want we can always provide them with the relevant documents
6842421 the intention is quite clear the state government would be responsible for any eventuality
6842422 you seem to be in a mental state of the 1960s as you frequently call bandhs when the economy takes a beating and people are forced to remain indoors what did you gain by yesterdays bandh
6842423 no wonder investors move away from west bengal to gujarat because the economic climate there is more congenial than here
6842424 how can it be that the people of the three left ruled states have a perception about bandhs that is not shared by the rest of the country which carries on normally on such days
6842425 but a last resort of the people when their pent up feelings go unresponded
6842426 if you want a serious debate dont be led by prejudices against the left
6842427 if investors shy away from bengal its not because of bandhs but for other reasons
6842428 actually he is quite worried about the developments in singur he did not anticipate this kind of thing to happen for such a project
6842429 he has made a lot of investment and it is not his intention to pull out until and unless he is forced to do so by circumstances
6842430 tata thought that the small car project will be beneficial to the people of bengal and that it will be welcomed by all
6842431 we have told tata that as far as discussions with the trinamul congress are concerned they have assured us that there would be no lawlessness there will be peaceful demonstration
6842432 i hope all parties even those who are opposing us will think before any kind of action so that the project can go through peacefully
6842433 i cant say whether the second meeting will be held tomorrow or the day after but it may take place the official said
6842434 it the government wants to take the rest of the property
6842435 going by the land ceiling rules an organisation cannot hold over 7 5 acres in urban areas and 24 20 acres in other areas
6842436 so the church in jalpaiguri will have to hand over the excess land
6842437 we give free education boarding food and vocational training to poor children a christian missionary had donated the land and our main source of income is from cultivation of paddy dairy farming and pisciulture on this land
6842438 it will be impossible for us to run the institution if the land is taken away
6842439 i am only aware about the problem with a church in jalpaiguri i am looking into the complaints of the other churches
6842440 if the state government turns a blind eye we will organise law violation programmes and march to the assembly
6842441 congress supporters had planned to disrupt construction work for which they were not allowed to enter the project site only a scuffle between police and a section of agitators took place in front of the main gate of the project area today the allegation of congress leaders being humiliated by policemen is false we didnt resort to lathicharge

6842572 if its out there and you can get it you know go ahead im certainly not going to get into mode about this
6842573 its well documented i dont even have a computer and i dont get involved in that type of gear
6842574 if people are willing to have faceless cds like that in their collection good for them it would be absolutely ludicrous for a rock star to demand that people pay money for albums because the kids havent got that much money to pay for an album so if they can find it for free go ahead but dont do it on oasis records though because thats against the law

6842663 man betalar bara en avkastningsskatt varje r p sitt v rde men man handlar skattefritt i portf ljen
6842664 men andra sidan r pengarna l sta under ett r s man kan inte plocka ut pengarna under hela f rsta ret
6842665 det kan lika g rna vara s att man har bytt fr n en produkt till en annan
6842666 f r att skattereglerna har ndrats och kapitalpension finns inte l ngre som produkt men det r en m ngd olika produkter som har den gemensamma beteckningen kapitalf rs kringar s det r v ldigt sv rt att s ga n got generellt om kapitalf rs kringar
6842667 men eftersom f rs kringssparande r ett l ngsiktigt sparande ska totalavkastningen ses i ett l ngre perspektiv
6842668 det terst r att se livf rs kring r en l ngsiktig produkt det finns en samverkan mellan hur man f rdelar verskott och hur verskott uppst r

6842672 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
6842673 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
6842674 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
6842675 theyve continued their own place naming tradition by naming their son after zuma beach in malibu
6842676 he drove up the coast slept in his car and started making the moves that would launch his career
6842677 this name obviously links to big brother kingstons and is another nod to jamaica and reggae
6842678 the reason why the statistics are so alarming is men dont go in for check ups even though oral cancer is more prevalent in the african american community
6842679 by the time we as black men have oral cancer it is advanced
6842680 many of them have insurance and they just dont go either because of fear or preconceived notions or complete ignorance about what goes on in a dentists office
6842681 see how things work and how much better it is they realize their fears were unwarranted
6842682 it is a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for a long time the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of war
6842683 theres a touch of macabre ridiculousness to it i think weve seen a lot of attempts to make serious movies about serious things and it strikes me that we might be a little more artful about how we make a point these days
6842684 mark wahlberg we had a hell of a time on max payne i think hes an actor of unlimited potential and id just love to go around with him again but were not in control of these things lots of big people with big checkbooks get to do that if its going to happen then the karma makes it happen
6842685 west africas annual floods bring with them not only the threat of vector borne and communicable diseases but it further endangers the lives of people already malnourished by the food price crisis
6842686 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
6842687 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
6842688 we found that the odor profile coming from the skin of skin cancer patients was markedly different than that coming from healthy skin
6842689 so we think that this kind of biomarker could be used in a rapid and noninvasive way to detect skin cancer
6842690 and this would be novel because now the only way to do so is with a visual exam and a biopsy which is of course invasive
6842691 this work is preliminary but i think within a few years its reasonable to say that this could end up being a diagnostic tool that would be a routine thing one could do in a doctors office its a real possibility
6842692 in terms of this replacing the standard method we have of diagnosing skin cancer which is basically to look at a specimen under the microscope its hard to imagine this would do it completely because when youre dealing with cancer the margin for error is really small you dont want to miss something that may be a cancer that then doesnt get treated and you dont want to treat someone for cancer if they actually have something else so its really a very novel and interesting idea but one which i think really needs to be further researched and carefully confirmed
6842693 its amazing lord amp awesome how prosperous migara rohaneyya is how great his treasures how great his resources

6842703 foreigners are selling out bonds which is seen from bigger spreads and stocks which is clear from declining benchmarks
6842704 while many investors were plainly shocked by the escalation of the conflict with georgia we think that those bold enough to increase their russia exposure at this time of perceived elevated may be rewarded
6842705 although volatility can be unwelcome in the short term it is precisely at times such as this that active managers can take advantage of market inefficiencies
6842706 we believe the long term investment case for russia is compelling
6842707 the team is definitely on a high right now believing we were going to make a statement in the whole tournament

6842710 he is the guest of the iranian government who will control him until such time they have comfortably wrested control of the mahdi army away from him

6842714 we are a separate people we were never part of india
6842715 the indian army has unleashed a reign of terror in kashmir
6842716 the peace process between india and pakistan failed to change the ground situation in kashmir
6842717 now this festering wound is manifesting itself on the streets this is a mass uprising and in many ways more serious and comprehensive than the early 1990s
6842718 we will make sure that this provocation is not taking place
6842719 its not about our fear its about the people waiting in gaza you cant think about anything else
6842720 he said he was unable to gain altitude and was going down
6842721 in that statement she was requesting that he come out and give himself up
6842722 a set of causes probably came together to cause the accident
6842723 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it

6842725 in athens when we were getting drug testing an athlete walked by and saw us he asked why do you need to do that you dont even break a sweat
6842726 you have to stay calm and tell yourself its going to be ok it just hurts

6842740 they shall go to confession and to communion with the intention of giving themselves to jesus christ in the quality of slaves of love by the hands of mary
6842741 it would be well also that on that day they should pay some tribute to jesus christ and our blessed lady either as a penance for their past unfaithfulness to the vows of their baptism or as testimony of their dependence on the dominion of jesus and mary
6842742 once a year at least on the same day they should renew the same consecration observing the same practices during the three weeks they might also once a month or even once a day renew all they have done in these few words
6842743 i am all thine and all that i have belongs to thee o my sweet jesus through mary thy holy mother
6842744 i retired from one day cricket for cricketing reasons and im coming back for cricketing reasons
6842745 id been told by so many people to try to get steve harmison so i though id give it a final go

6842755 i think the main fact is that the median household income in the united states is 48 201 per year meaning that mccain spent over five times as much on servants as the typical household earns in an entire year on the other hand mccains relatively lavish household staff expenditures probably explains why he sees tax cuts for high income individuals as a sound job creation strategy
6842756 i am not worried about that i know nothing about it only that klaas feels very good at ajax we want to finish the coming season with klaas
6842757 we have already said earlier that we dont want to see a repeat of what happened last season when a player left ajax at a very late stage
6842758 if you see him go after all you cant do anything with the money that the transfer brings in
6842759 he is part of my plans but you have to understand that when he played at milan he was with players with different characteristics
6842760 champions there are different than in england we need to think about this balance
6842761 maybe he needs more confidence maybe more confidence with me maybe he needs more of the normal training he is having now maybe he needs more time
6842762 now i have anelka in a good situation sheva needs time and i need time
6842763 an assembly of short stories on race struggle and achievement
6842764 almost all of the african american women writers that i know were very much uninterested in one area of the world white men that frees up a lot from the establishment the reviewers the people who are in control one you erase that from your canvas you can really play
6842765 journalists would ask me about negative stereotypes do i think im confirming for white people their negative images about black people
6842766 i had a black conservative tell me on a talk show once i didnt make it because of civil rights civil rights didnt write my resume i said yeah but civil rights made somebody

6843011 you see a nanny at the park seemingly mistreating her charge
6843012 presume that if i am an adult in the sort of park where i can safely assume such a woman is a nanny than i too am a nanny and thus inclined to believe any nanny with the audacity to mistreat her charge in public is probably acting in self defense

6843014 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

6843016 since 1982 we have added 25 million plus jobs in this country we will have a larger pie
6843017 people will be fighting over the pie but thats a wonderful thing even if we grow at 1 percent per year we double the gdp per capita in 75 years the pie will grow enough that everyone will get more of the pie
6843018 total sales by the big three carriers will amount to 3 5 million iphones within the next two years
6843019 this number 3 5 million could turn out to be inflated the operators could lose money because they took all risks upon themselves having failed to dictate terms to retail chains through which they will sell the iphones

6843069 august is a busy month in the seattle clubs i continue to listen to the djs and producers im going to see soon this week its max graham
6843070 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6843071 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6843072 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6843073 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6843074 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6843075 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6843076 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6843077 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6843078 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6843079 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6843080 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6843081 if you trust every web site but not a government
6843082 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6843083 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6843084 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6843085 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6843086 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6843087 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6843088 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6843089 all of the well done studies show that for someone who is healthy has normal joints no underlying injuries or disease and isnt bowlegged running will not cause osteoarthritis
6843090 i think there is evidence that patients who run do get osteoarthritis
6843091 walking and ambulatory activities dont cause arthritis pounding on the pavement does

6843095 this article introduces the participatory action research paradigm which is based upon the goal of helping people and employs methodologies that are different from traditional consumer research
6843096 consumer researchers interested in building a transformative research agenda can use these exemplars to better define their relationship with the people whose life they hope to change explicate a theory of social change to guide their research efforts and inspire creative methods of data collection
6843097 for those of us who are fortunate enough to possess these considerable resources it is time to move away from the comfort of the sidelines step onto the field and charge into the important work of solving our pressing social problems
6843098 we think that the distribution builder can function like a flight simulator allowing investors to explore the outcomes of their decisions with only virtual outcomes
6843099 beyond financial services the basic db framework could be used to study other consumer choices in which there is a risk reward tradeoff including waiting times at health clinics or on customer support lines delivery times of packages and overage charges for mobile phone plans

6843135 we leerden toen dat we onze eigen vijand zijn als we niet goed zorgen voor onze infrastructuur
6843136 we willen van new york de groenste stad in het land maken
6843137 als je de keus hebt tussen nietsdoen en iets stoms doen is het beter om niets te doen
6843138 saakasjvili had moeten weten dat een militair optreden tegen zuid osseti een zelfmoordactie is hij had moeten weten dat hij met het russische leger te maken zou krijgen het is onduidelijk hoe het militaire offensief tegen georgi tot stand kwam maar als die was gepland dan vraag ik me af hoe men ooit zon aanval kon beginnen
6843139 als hij daarop heeft gerekend moet men echt aan zijn verstand twijfelen vanuit het westen is hem telkens weer duidelijk gemaakt wij ondersteunen de territoriale integriteit van georgi maar we zijn tegen een militaire oplossing van het conflict zelfs de vs hielden hem voor wees voorzichtig
6843140 foutieve gedachte dat hij saakasjvili dt vrienden heeft aan het hof
6843141 daarna zijn de provocaties van de osseten begonnen de plunderingen van georgische dorpen saakasjvili kon niet niet reageren
6843142 hij had geen keus in ieder geval zouden de russen vroeg of laat zijn binnengevallen net zoals dat is gebeurd in augustus 1999 in tsjetsjeni
6843143 het ging erom definitief te voorkomen dat georgi lid wordt van de navo de russische autoriteiten wilden het georgische leger vernietigen en het huidige regime met zijn president voor wie vladimir poetin dezelfde hardnekkige haat voelt als voor de oligarch michail chodorkovski de oud topman van het oliebedrijf yukos die tot acht jaar strafkamp is veroordeeld dt wat de russen leken te beogen is een federale staat met zeer beperkte macht waarvan de veiligheid zou worden gegarandeerd door het russische leger
6843144 ik heb tegen god gezegd ik ben het niet waard deze weg te gaan maar als het uw wil is zal ik die volgen
6843145 ik wist dat vele christenen voor me baden zelfs als ik terugkwam na slaag en mishandeling voelde ik geen wrok tegen die mensen maar liefde dat kon alleen maar omdat ik de kracht van god kreeg
6843146 het kan de prijs zijn die we voor het geloof moeten betalen daar is de bijbel duidelijk over ik weet echter dat mij uiteindelijk de overwinning wacht
6843147 ik ben bereid tot de dood te gaan wegens uw liefde
6843148 ik voelde al jong diep in mijn hart een drang om andere mensen met het evangelie bekend te maken
6843149 ik heb nooit verlangd naar optredens tijdens de overdenking van de bijbel kwamen de liederen in me op toen ik veertien jaar was heb ik voor het eerst gezongen tijdens een kerkdienst
6843150 zij probeerde mij te wurgen een maand lang heb ik nauwelijks kunnen slapen omdat ik alert moest blijven of omdat mijn containergenote begon te schreeuwen de vrouw kreeg geen medicijnen en wist daardoor absoluut niet wat ze allemaal deed
6843151 ik overdacht vaak de weg van christus hij deed geen kwaad hij genas de zieken maar werd toch vervolgd als hij als onze meester zo behandeld werd moeten we er niet vreemd van opkijken dat het ons ook zo vergaat
6843152 hij gehoorzaamde drie dagen lang moest hij reizen tot hij bij de berg was lang genoeg om in vertwijfeling te raken en te besluiten terug te keren na die drie dagen werd hem echter gods liefde geopenbaard zo heb ik ook in mijn hart gezegd dat ik tot het einde toe door zal gaan en ook in moeilijke tijden god niet los zal laten je kunt niet voor een bepaalde tijd met hem wandelen en dan ineens het geloof opgeven
6843153 mensen vinden dat vaak verbazingwekkend maar alleen zo hield ik het vol soms bad ik alleen maar vaak ook met andere christenen we baden ook altijd voor onze medegevangenen het was ons veel waard hen te bereiken met het evangelie sommigen kwamen tot geloof
6843154 we probeerden ons als christenen niet egocentrisch op te stellen we verzorgden de zieken brachten de emmers met ontlasting weg daardoor verraadden ze ons ook niet wanneer we met elkaar de bijbel overdachten
6843155 ja ik begrijp dat want om staande te kunnen blijven heb je genade nodig ik heb geprobeerd haar te bemoedigen wees sterk zei ik verwacht het van god ze kon het echter niet volhouden en is na haar vrijlating in een psychiatrische inrichting beland
6843156 wanneer je in de container zit met plannen voor de toekomst en met alle macht wilt leven loop je grote kans gek te worden ik had geen plan meer ik dacht het enige wat jullie met me kunnen doen is me doden iemand kan in zon situatie pas overlevenwanneer hij zichzelf heeft overgegeven om te sterven ik heb een dochter eva het zou zwaar geweest zijn haar los te laten maar het gaf me kracht dat ik ervan overtuigd was dat zij ook na mijn dood de weg van het geloof zou gaan
6843157 gelovigen die dienst doen in het leger zijn betrouwbare mensen ze doen hun plicht ze zijn nuttig voor de maatschappij en verzetten zich niet tegen de autoriteiten vanuit geestelijk standpunt bezien is de vervolging echter niet verwonderlijk de bijbel leert ons dat we verdrukking zullen lijden
6843158 ik denk dagelijks aan de voorgangers die nog vastzitten ik voel grote bezorgdheid over hun toestand soms worden er opeens christenen vrijgelaten maar daar zit geen structurele lijn in ik kan moeilijk hoopvol zijn op dit moment
6843159 ze worden continu gevolgd ik zou willen dat ze hiernaartoe komen zeker omdat ik hen graag weer zou ontmoeten
6843160 ik ben blij dat ik vanuit denemarken een boodschapper kan zijn voor hen die in eritrea in de problemen zitten ik leef nu in vrijheid om anderen een stem te geven

6843175 there is a personnel action that has been taken but because its a personnel action i cannot really comment any further until that personnel action is completed
6843176 in athens when we were getting drug testing an athlete walked by and saw us he asked why do you need to do that you dont even break a sweat

6843189 para impulsar la creaci n de empresas que produzcan tubos sin costuras para petr leo y gas
6843190 honestly i think the springs are too hard i think you could soften them loosen up the damping a bit and make the car more rewarding to drive on ordinary roads without giving up a lot of handling capability i also noticed a few hiccups in the throttle response which sometimes continues to roll on when you lift off for an upshift and sometimes hits a dead spot when youre trying to blip the gas for a heel and toe downshift
6843191 i agree with you completely i think what weve got here is a car thats great for someone who wants performance optimized for the slalom course but i wouldnt mind softening the suspension a bit without raising the ride height much you dont need a race car on the street a softer setup would be more like what a guy at my well seasoned age would enjoy
6843192 its the idle return has to do with meeting emissions i think we may be able to iron that out eventually

6843403 tieni a me parla interamente di adolescenti in modo diverso come aveva gi riconosciuto roberto de laurentiis il grande produttore che mi ha incoraggiata per primo ad andare avanti lui sosteneva che questopera racchiude un microcosmo molto reale e vero i problemi dei ragazzi non sono affrontati in modo mieloso ho cercato di distaccarmi dallo stile degli autori di botteghino e di parlare realmente dei giovani e della loro solitudine mi piace anche ricordare che c anche un altro tema insolito per il cinema italiano che quello dei bambini contesi tra due genitori separati lispettore vardo e la moglie sviluppata in una sotto trama di grande impatto emotivo che rispecchia lo stile di kramer contro kramer

6843409 il film che abbiamo scelto come guest star ha fatto parlare anche per la presenza di fabrizio corona una scelta spregiudicata quella di metterlo nel cast ma coraggiosa secondo me il cinema deve raccontare la realt io andavo dietro a pietrangeli come aiuto regista quando la sandrelli impersonava una velina dellepoca corona racconta i nostri tempi certo la produzione ha fatto bene a licenziarlo per non far risucchiare il suo lavoro nel vortice del gossip ma un film su corona senza corona racconterebbe davvero i nostri tempi

6843411 the united states has 2 trillion barrels of oil shale
6843412 this is more than seven times the amount of crude oil reserves found in saudi arabia and is enough to meet current u s demand for over 250 years
6843413 the u s could completely end its dependence on opec by 2020
6843414 even a moderate estimate of 800 billion barrels of recoverable oil from oil shale in the green river formation is three times greater than the proven oil reserves of saudi arabia

6843446 the market is of this mind set that were going to continue to be flattish to down
6843447 this is almost the same team that got to the quarterfinals four years ago and now we are in an olympic final its incredible for us and for our people people that had suffered can now be happy
6843448 i dont think i realize how important it is what we just achieved we are in the olympic gold medal final there are a lot of emotions right now i am very happy we weon even though we had some bad moments
6843449 i missed my shots its basketball it was the small details we missed easy shots
6843450 we will look forward to the gold this is an olympic final we know we have very few chances but we have chances
6843451 we gave away the first quarter and we paid a very expensive price for that after that it was an uphill battle especially after emanuel ginobilis injury
6843452 we didnt do what we planned and you cannot afford that against a team like the usa

6843469 this article introduces the participatory action research paradigm which is based upon the goal of helping people and employs methodologies that are different from traditional consumer research

6843473 on the one hand consumers perceive the mini packs to be a generous portion of food numerous small food morsels in each pack and multiple mini packs in each box on the other hand consumers perceive the mini packs to be diet food for chronic dieters this perceptual dilemma causes a tendency to overeat due to their emotion laden relationship with food

6843476 the increasing availability of single serve and multi packs may not serve consumers in the long run but because they are considered to be innocent pleasures may turn out to be sneaky small sins
6843477 our basic premise is that consumer purchases are altered by the portfolio of drink sizes made available
6843478 consumers who purchased a 16 ounce drink when a 12 ounce drink was available later chose a 21 ounce drink when the 12 ounce drink option was removed since now the 16 ounce soda is the smallest option
6843479 this effect also occurred at the large end of the spectrum people who purchased a 21 ounce drink when the 32 ounce drink was the largest size available moved up to the 32 ounce drink when a 44 ounce drink was added to the range of drink sizes available

6843500 became the first female to play in pop warner football tournament
6843501 in meeuwen maakte ik een geslaagd debuut met een voorlaatste plaats in de b finale 15e plaats op 24 deelnemers
6843502 de druk om in lommel beter te doen was dus groot en na de training zag het er niet zo rooskleurig uit toen ik mijn tijd vergeleek met de tijden van de andere deelnemers
6843503 al snel zag ik dat ik onder de grens van 30 seconden ging en in de laatste ronde reed ik mijn snelste ronde waardoor tevens het doel werd gehaald om in de 29 7 te rijden ik wist dat ik hiermee makkelijk in de b finale kon vertrekken maar op een vierde plek had ik nooit durven hopen
6843504 de start was gewoon perfect het was op het randje van een valse start dus beter had gewoon niet gekund door de opstelling op de grid was het ofwel een plaats winnen ofwel verliezen dus er moesten risicos genomen worden en ik slaagde in mijn opzet
6843505 na de eerste bocht kon ik me achter bram zetten in de hoop hem bij te kunnen houden maar doordat er ook druk van achter me kwam verloor ik toch wat tijd op de twee jongens voor me
6843506 mijn kart voor de race was duidelijk minder goed voor mijn rijstijl en dus verloor ik alsmaar meer tijd in de middelste sector een sector die me tot dan toe redelijk goed lag en na een tiental ronden lag yves ineens achter me ik kon hem enkele bochten achter me houden maar ineens verraste hij me en moest ik hem laten gaan niet veel later deed jo hetzelfde ik kon met deze kart in die ene bocht niet meer de juiste lijn vinden en dat werd onmiddellijk afgestraft
6843507 een onverhoopt goed resultaat en het is altijd leuk elke race beter te doen nog nooit lag mijn gemiddelde tijd zo kort bij mijn snelste dus ik kijk nu enorm uit naar maasmechelen een circuit dat me normaal nog iets beter zou moeten liggen

6843582 the forces of inflation and deflation are now fighting each other for the first time since 2001 and ultimately inflation will win
6843583 for the fed and other central banks the strategy is to rescue the global financial system from the economic abyss or deflation that means print credit like theres no tomorrow
6843584 the fed the ecb the bank of japan and their international buddies are going to accelerate the expansion of credit to avoid a devastating deflation thus im betting on inflation im also betting on gold my gold stocks
6843585 meanwhile anglogold has been a major disappointment over the last three years at a time when gold stocks have averaged a 15 annualized return based on the xau gold amp silver index anglos stock price is down 22 in 2008
6843586 but after a huge decline over the last several years anglogolds stock price is just too low to ignore at this price its a strong speculation in our portfolio
6843587 anglogold has one of the biggest forward hedged sales among its peers steadily rising bullion prices has turned gold producers away from hedging since 2005 in favor of direct exposure to spot prices
6843588 companies that have hedged their production over the last few years have been poor performers because spot prices have surged that trend is finally changing at anglogold the worlds third largest gold producer
6843589 anglogolds ceo mark cutifani was quoted recently claiming hell reduce the companys forward sales by 0 8 million ounces down to 6 1 million ounces by december anglos ceo also believes gold prices will end the year at 1 000 an ounce
6843590 anglogold has also opened the door to a suitor for a possible merger i cant think of a more undervalued gold mining company right now at this depressed price than anglogold we are adding the stock to our gold bugs model portfolio
6843591 i bet they sneak away for a few minutes to watch the united states versus argentina 2008 olympics semi final basketball game today i would seriously on the one hand central bankers face the prospect of another round of housing related write offs and the need to intervene to keep markets liquid on the other hand we still have oil fed inflation in the system so my sense is they will issue a statement indicating that the major central banks stand at the ready to provide additional liquidity and take other measures to keep markets functioning
6843592 i would really like to see some european central bank comments from president jean claude trichet that hes ready to cut rates and that the greater risk in europe like the u s is toward recession demand in europe is slowing and if e u u s trade flows continue to decline that will prolong the recession hence ecb monetary policy is intrinsic to the recovery story
6843593 probably the most important item on their agenda after maintaining liquid functioning markets concerns long term interest rates they havent fallen due to banks reluctance to lend in order to repair their balance sheets housing faces a 2 3 year recovery period but well need long term mortgage rates for 30 year fixed loans to drift back toward 6 00 or 5 75 to speed housings transition back to health if monetary officials dont find a way to get long term rates to trend lower that delays the recovery
6843594 the first thing they need to do is get off the inflation obsession the ecb is the worst in this regard but the bank of england is close behind its as if some central bankers have operated in a vacuum and havent seen the economic slowdown around them the slowdown has been abrupt and if were not careful the recession is going to be longer and deeper than most expect three or four percent inflation is a concern but its mostly oil driven and its not the biggest concern when growth is at a standstill
6843595 i would put financial stability at the top of the list and by that i mean the bond and credit markets the markets will face two more adjustments ahead probably more mortgage write offs and some type of infusion for a cash strapped fre credit markets remain in distressed condition so central bankers will need to build up and ready hundreds of billions of dollars more in emergency credit to prevent markets from freezing again like they did at the start of the housing slump

6843671 historically modern societies double their wealth about every twenty five years this kind of growth projected across the next half century would dwarf the extra pension and other costs to society of more elderly dependents moreover it is far from certain that extra years of life mean extra years of ill health and dependency serious disease tends to be concentrated towards the end of life so living longer may simply postpone the point of onset without increasing the costs

6843680 suicide bombing is not just a religious phenomenon it is employed by many secular organisations including the kurdish pkk and the marxist tamil tigers
6843681 ariel merari a tel aviv university psychologist has profiled 50 suicide bombers and found that there were hardly any common factors none were deranged or schizophrenic few had problems like depression merari concluded that the only factor linking all forms of suicide terrorism was the way bombers were recruited and trained it is the psychology of the group not the individual that is key
6843682 there are serious flaws in the nss and the approach it embodies but it is a document which offers all things to all readers while being strangely unable to provide much in the way of vision leadership and motivation or strategy in other words the nss refers to the uks core values human rights the rule of law legitimate and accountable government justice freedom tolerance and opportunity for all but these values are mentioned in a strangely passive and defensive way almost as if the most that should be done with these immense ideas is to protect them from marauding terrorists and criminals and of course to stop them being ruined by flood water saddest of all these values appear to constitute little more than the normality to which we are told the governments security strategy will enable us to return as soon as possible after some harm occurs

6843689 the milieu of terrorists is invariably morally squalid when it is not merely criminal
6843690 the data show that there is little connection between suicide terrorism and islamic fundamentalism or any religion for that matter in fact the leading instigator of suicide attacks is the tamil tigers in sri lanka a marxist leninist group whose members are from hindu families but who are adamantly opposed to religion they have have committed 75 of the 188 incidents
6843691 liberal democracies may be able to resist muslim terrorism but the greatest long running threat to secularism democracy and science could come from within from the emerging coalition of the religious right and the romantic left brought together by a loathing for open society that they share with each other and with osama bin laden
6843692 bombs threaten life and property as would more harmful devices not yet found in the possession of terrorists but that they might conceivably obtain
6843693 we have discovered that state attempts to guarantee fairness through monopoly provision by monolithic public services turns out to be as unfair as previous ideas of 98 tax rates and forced equality of outcome so if monopoly state provision is not the answer what is evidence from around the world shows that just as a broad consensus now exists that we should be free to make our own choices and to innovate in the private sphere so we must trust choice competition in provision and local decision making in public services

6843785 the design had to be like no other because 9 11 was a day like no other
6843786 we wanted it to capture the magnitude of the events that played out that day
6843787 now that the place is almost open we can begin to digest everything
6843788 its been an intensely positive experience but a lot of hard work all the way around were not sure well ever be able to top this experience or describe how honored we feel about being a part of this

6843891 los refugiados sigue relatando monse or pasotto entre 80 000 y 90 000 est n diseminados en doscientos puntos de acogida de la ciudad los primeros d as permanec an completamente en silencio no pod an pronunciar palabra ayer los j venes de la parroquia se acercaron a un centro para ofrecer actividades a los ni os y han constatado que las mujeres est n reaccionando pero los hombres permanecen a n en silencio
6843892 a n hay tensi n no se entiende por qu a pesar de lo acordado est todo bloqueado y uno no puede andar por donde quiere
6843893 tanto el gobierno georgiano como el patriarcado ortodoxo explica el prelado han pedido ayuda a la iglesia cat lica y estamos haciendo todo lo posible con un gran esp ritu de colaboraci n
6843894 ha habido momentos de encuentro muy hermosos afirma monse or pasotto es importante en situaciones como sta sentirse unidos m s all de las diferencias de la fe
6843895 ahora afirma monse or pasotto no faltan las ayudas internacionales pero la situaci n de precariedad amenaza con durar mucho ya se dice que las escuelas no abrir n porque est n todas ocupadas por los refugiados
6843896 quiz s algunos de ellos puedan volver a gori pero no a tsjinvali ser necesario reconstruir las casas y vigilar para que todos reciban ayuda y no se olvide a nadie que est necesitado despu s de siete u ocho meses se recordar a n a georgia
6843897 es necesario que no se limiten a buscar el sensacionalismo sino que obren el bien para ayudar a los que sufren y que den una informaci n lo m s correcta posible
6843898 de la dificultad de trabajar juntos en el campo internacional
6843899 el sistema multilateral se encuentra en una especie de crisis y esto va en detrimento de los pa ses m s d biles y pobres
6843900 ha habido una reticencia a la hora de afrontar de forma decisiva la cuesti n fundamental del desarme at mico
6843901 procede de la ineficacia y la falta de resultados en las discusiones mantenidas en los ltimos a os respecto a estos temas
6843902 se pagar un precio si se contin a por este camino la falta de comunicaci n de intercambio si esta globalizaci n que lo penetra todo es limitada por el nacionalismo y el proteccionismo existe el riesgo de nuevos problemas para la familia humana
6843903 nuestra inspiraci n cristiana nos lleva a ver a la familia humana como unida como una no nos refugiamos en una abstracci n intelectual sino que tenemos que afrontar las situaciones concretas llevando este mensaje de unidad de solidaridad con responsabilidad
6843904 en la historia los muros no han servido y no servir n tampoco en este momento se construyen muros entre palestinos e israel es entre estadounidenses y mexicanos esto es contrario a la perspectiva de solidaridad y de comuni n de participaci n que nace del hecho de que todos somos hijos de dios
6843905 favorecer e incrementar adecuadas iniciativas encaminadas a superar situaciones de pobreza
6843906 un decidido empe o en fomentar la laboriosidad la honestidad el esp ritu de participaci n el respeto de la justicia y de los derechos humanos como exigencia y testimonio de los valores evang licos que hagan posible una sociedad m s justa pac fica y solidaria

6843908 a robustecer los lazos de solidaridad entre todos los argentinos
6843909 viva gratitud a las personas e instituciones que generosamente contribuyen al buen resultado de la colecta imparti ndoles con afecto la implorada bendici n apost lica
6843910 valiosa contribuci n a la promoci n de la m sica sacra
6843911 desde el inicio de mi vida mi hermano siempre ha sido para m no s lo un compa ero sino tambi n un gu a digno de confianza ha sido para m un punto de orientaci n y de referencia con la claridad la determinaci n de sus decisiones
6843912 siempre me ha mostrado el camino que hay que tomar tambi n en situaciones dif ciles
6843913 donde realmente la buena m sica de la catedral domingo tras domingo fue para m un apoyo un consuelo un gozo ntimo reflejo de la belleza de dios
6843914 mi hermano ha mencionado el hecho de que hemos llegado a la ltima etapa de nuestra vida la vejez los d as de vida se reducen progresivamente
6843915 pero tambi n en esta etapa mi hermano me ayuda a aceptar con serenidad con humildad y con valent a el peso de cada d a le doy las gracias
6843916 en cincuenta a os el templo se convirti en una especie de rica multinacional al servicio de la cruzada
6843917 los templarios practicaban en secreto ritos paganos y hab an abandonado la fe cristiana
6843918 gracias a afortunados descubrimientos de las actas conservadas en el archivo secreto vaticano hoy sabemos que la disciplina primitiva del templo y su esp ritu aut ntico se hab an corrompido con el paso del tiempo cayendo en la decadencia y dejando abierta la difusi n de las malas costumbres
6843919 pero de ning n modo se hab an convertido en herejes y el proceso fue en definitiva un medio para apropiarse de su patrimonio
6843920 era un acto totalmente ilegal pues s lo el papa ten a facultad para investigar sobre una orden religiosa de la iglesia de roma como era precisamente el templo
6843921 el pont fice suprimi la orden sin pronunciar una sentencia
6843922 y en el concilio de vienne de 1312 pidi que se declarara en las actas que el proceso no hab a aportado pruebas contrarias de herej a contra ellos
6843923 sobre la historia de los templarios todav a hay verdaderamente mucho que investigar y el estudio de la espiritualidad de esta antigua orden religiosa dar a la cultura contempor nea otros nuevos motivos de discusi n
6843924 no cre is que vuestros seres queridos han muerto viven para dios
6843925 da las razones para esperar vivir y creer que la muerte como dijo el se or no es el t rmino de la vida sino un paso
6843926 nos cuenta mucho aceptar la desaparici n de un ser querido pero es un tr nsito de pasar al padre
6843927 no s lo de madrid sino tambi n de otras di cesis
6843928 ofrecemos la presencia de la iglesia y aquellos que se sienten miembros de la comunidad eclesial espont neamente nos ped an consuelo apoyo palabras estamos all y aqu l que quiera hablar con nosotros lo hace con toda libertad
6843929 la gente se acerca con toda libertad porque tienen necesidad de hablar o porque quieren que hablemos con otras personas que no se acercan directamente
6843930 me siento fortalecido en mi fe cuando veo que pese al dolor sufrido por el terremoto os acercasteis m s a dios
6843931 durante la misa nuestros tres visitantes fueron testigos de la fe de la gente que lo perdi todo
6843932 me cuesta creer lo que veo ante mis ojos la intervenci n de c ritas significa para todos nosotros un sue o hecho realidad
6843933 en su nimo informa a zenit la universidad t cnica particular de loja s lo lat a el deseo de poder compartir con ellos aunque s lo fueran pocos d as toda la riqueza que ten an en s a cambio de algo tan grande como la gratitud de la sonrisa de un ni o o las l grimas de un adulto que develan el dolor de la vida y que puede ser confortada con la cercan a de alguien para quien su vida es importante o la esperanza de un joven que puede encontrar un nuevo sentido a su vida y descubrir que su horizonte es mucho m s amplio de lo que jam s hab a so ado
6843934 toda una cultura de trabajo ha quedado destruida porque en los campos de refugiados recib an a diario sus raciones de comida ahora ya no saben c mo ganarse el sustento
6843935 ayudar a estas personas a reorganizar sus vidas tambi n desde el punto de vista espiritual y cultural
6843936 han presenciado el secuestro de sus hijos la violaci n de sus hermanas madres hijas y otras mujeres y c mo asesinaban a personas delante de sus ojos
6843937 los futuros sacerdotes hayan compartido las experiencias de la poblaci n
6843938 dios ha tra do la paz al lograr que las personas se hartaran de la guerra
6843939 tenemos la ntima convicci n de que la guerra ha terminado
6843940 qui n dice la gente que es el hijo del hombre
6843941 algunos que juan el bautista otros que el as otros que jerem as o alguno de los profetas
6843942 t eres pedro y sobre esta piedra edificar mi iglesia

6843945 vosotros que veis qu uso hab is hecho de la luz
6843946 no es posible seguir creyendo en la existencia de los demonios
6843947 por medio de la presente dec a la ltima parte de la retractaci n del padre lvarez vald s quiero retractarme de estas afirmaciones y reconocer que eran err neas y contrarias a las ense anzas de la iglesia cat lica a la que amo y deseo servir fielmente desde mi ministerio asimismo quiero dejar en claro que me someto a todo lo que la santa madre iglesia cree y ense a y que deseo permanecer siempre unido a ella

6843976 consular officials are in contact with her and her family in the uk we continue to underline to the chinese government the need to respect its commitment to freedom of expression at the same time we encourage all uk visitors to china to respect local laws
6843977 it is just outrageous that people can be held without trial she was just filming the protest she was not touching a tibetan flag or anything
6843978 it makes a mockery of the assurances about human rights that china has given to the olympic committee
6843979 we want to make sure gordon brown is fully briefed about this ahead of the closing ceremony
6843980 i am appalled than anyone should be arrested and sentenced to imprisonment without trial simply for speaking out about tibet
6843981 this just shows the other face of china which their authorities dont want us to see there is clearly no democracy no freedom of speech and no rule of law in china and its about time we spoke out and made our views known
6843982 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6843983 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6843984 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6843985 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6843986 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6843987 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6843988 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6843989 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6843990 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6843991 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6843992 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6843993 who do people say that the son of man is
6843994 some say john the baptist others say elijah and others jeremiah or one of the prophets
6843995 you are the christ the son of the living god
6843996 we should begin at home we too often flog the church when the whip should be laid on our own shoulders we drag the church like a colossal culprit to the alter we bind her and try and execute her at once we bind her hands fast and tear off thongfull after thongfull of her quivering flesh finding fault with her where there is none and magnifying her little errors while we too often forget ourselves

6844000 giant killer for the stunning upsets by his horses said the decision to enter tizbig was made based on observation and instinct
6844001 he looked strong on tuesday when he was galloping said jerkens who saddled onion when he upset secretariat in saratogas whitney handicap 35 years ago this month
6844002 itll either make him run better or worse one or the other maybe hell run real big sometimes that happens and thats why were running him

6844005 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6844006 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6844007 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6844008 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6844009 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6844010 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6844011 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6844012 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6844013 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6844014 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6844015 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6844016 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6844017 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6844018 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6844019 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6844020 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6844021 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6844022 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6844023 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6844024 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6844025 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6844026 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6844027 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6844028 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6844029 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6844030 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6844031 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6844032 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6844033 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6844034 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6844035 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6844036 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6844037 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6844038 complacency is enemy number one when it comes to preparing for another influenza pandemic
6844039 these stories told so eloquently by survivors family members and friends from past pandemics serve as a sobering reminder of the devastating impact that influenza can have and reading them is a must for anyone involved in public health preparedness
6844040 it s an excellent resource not only for public health professionals but for people of all ages
6844041 its probably the closest to experiencing the real thing that many of us can imagine
6844042 ik zeg overal maar ja en amen op want die hormonenbom in mijn huis ontploft me iets te vaak
6844043 het is uiterst belangrijk dat jouw vrouw iemand heeft die haar bijstaat tijdens de opvoeding
6844044 de eerste week komt er een verpleegster die ons komt helpen maar daarna willen het samen gaan doen
6844045 het is wel makkelijk natuurlijk maar het is redelijk normaal als je een kind als stel zijnde opvoedt zonder een groep personeel om je heen
6844046 heute sind es nur noch 12 wenn man wirklich alle dazu z hlt
6844047 wir k nnen ein bauansuchen nicht ablehnen wenn ein heurigenbetrieb aufgelassen wird weil das gebiet als wohngebiet gewidmet ist
6844048 und wenn der weinbottich umgebaut wird ist das die n chste katastrophe f r grinzing
6844049 sie ist immer wieder im gespr ch dass sie wegen sch lermangels zugesperrt wird
6844050 in grinzing entstehen bauten wo ich sage das darf nicht sein
6844051 auch in der schutzzone gibt es einen fl chenwidmungsplan und der magistrat kann einem bauwerber nichts verbieten worauf er laut fl chenwidmungsplan einen anspruch hat
6844052 wie repariert man das denn wirklich alles zu verbieten w re der tod der schutzzone
6844053 das wollte die vp in der zeit der koalitionsregierung als vereinfachung
6844054 seit 13 august ist die baurechtsnovelle in kraft die deutlich strenge strafen bei verst en vorsieht
6844055 den heurigen in der sandgasse 4 wollte der nachfolger bernehmen aber der magistrat hat solche auflagen gemacht dass der junge gesagt hat da m ssen wir zusperren
6844056 after overcoming so much adversity in his life eric lamaze deserves gold
6844057 there are a bunch of country kids with olympic hopes in their hearts as they watched eric rise above it all and win big for canada
6844058 this is one of many excellent performances by canadians at the beijing olympics
6844059 take and eat it and it will make your stomach bitter but it will be as sweet as honey in your mouth
6844060 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6844061 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6844062 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6844063 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6844064 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6844065 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6844066 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6844067 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6844068 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6844069 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6844070 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6844071 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6844072 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6844073 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6844074 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6844075 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6844076 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6844077 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6844078 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6844079 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6844080 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6844081 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6844082 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6844083 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6844084 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6844085 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6844086 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6844087 just because someone else achieved your dream doesnt mean that you cant

6844441 i should have been established in my faith and ready to fight the battles that life would bring
6844442 but i wasnt i just took life as it happened and never really thought deeply about things my prayer life was a one way street and whenever i tried to read the bible through i would get halfway into genesis and become preoccupied with other things i had learned to trust in myself in my abilities and my family to make life as comfortable as possible
6844443 i really didnt think about hockey or a glamorous lifestyle
6844444 i still believed that i could manage life on my own
6844445 that i could control circumstances and keep everything together id been a christian for years but had never moved beyond my salvation experience into a close personal walk with jesus i had faith in the lord to save me from sin but didnt know him well enough to believe that he could care for all the details of my life

6844447 the lord began to show me what complete surrender was all about galatians 2 20 became a reality i have been crucified with christ and i no longer live but christ lives in me the life i live in the body i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me the lord was growing me up embracing me with his love as i ran into his arms
6844448 i believe there are times when god wants us to walk alone with him and stop looking to everyone else to meet our needs i wanted a doctor or my husband or my parents to give me the answers but the answers were in the word of god the cure was trusting in jesus to carry my burdens and make my load light

6844451 i feel like a toddler who has just grown enough to peek up over the edge of the counter god has given me a glimpse of his goodness and power and shown me that he never intended for his children to live as helpless victims of the enemy kevin and i believe god has placed us in the world of professional hockey to share his love and i am eager to see what he will accomplish as we learn to lean on him
6844452 taking every thought captive to the obedience of christ requires moment by moment laying down my agenda in exchange for intimate relationship with my lord
6844453 the challenge is in giving this relationship its rightful place in our full overflowing schedules
6844454 it has been one leap of faith after another as i am continually reminded of my inadequacies and weaknesses but it is an absolute joy and gift to be about my fathers business
6844455 so we are embracing the journey itself passing through the seasons of life where change is required and often difficult

6844519 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6844520 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6844521 se equivoca manuitt si cree que nos va a amedrentar con la fuerza policial
6844522 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas
6844523 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
6844524 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6844525 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6844526 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6844527 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6844528 es el pilar fundamental sobre el cual se sustentan las actividades que desarrolla el consejo nacional electoral cuyo paso inicial es la inscripci n y actualizaci n de datos ante el registro electoral
6844529 quienes visitaron recientemente miraflores interesados en que llegue una flota rusa a territorio venezolano les vamos a dar el apoyo para que lleguen a puerto venezolano
6844530 nosotros estamos a la vanguardia de los cambios que se dan en nuestra am rica
6844531 de eso se trata una revoluci n nunca se puede estar conforme yo soy el primero en criticar uno debe ser autocr tico siempre
6844532 es incre ble la cantidad de cosas que aqu est n pasando el horizonte se pierde de vista
6844533 esto es una evidencia de la madurez del pueblo y una muestra de la importancia que le otorgan los ciudadanos y ciudadanas a la participaci n pol tica por la v a del voto para los efectos de las tomas de decisiones
6844534 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6844535 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6844536 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6844537 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6844538 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6844539 the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war
6844540 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6844541 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6844542 seventy six civilians most of them women and children were martyred today in a coalition forces operation in herat province
6844543 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6844544 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6844545 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6844546 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6844547 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6844548 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6844549 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6844550 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6844551 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6844552 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6844553 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6844554 everyone says they would accept a face transplant if they were disfigured
6844555 the real question is would you be a donor or would you allow your family member to donate their face that is the answer we need to change
6844556 o pre o que estabelecido em itaipu determinado pelo anexo c do tratado o pre o praticado no brasil um pre o justo

6844558 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
6844559 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6844560 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6844561 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6844562 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6844563 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6844564 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6844565 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6844566 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6844567 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6844568 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6844569 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6844570 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6844571 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6844572 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6844573 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6844574 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6844575 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6844576 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6844577 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
6844578 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
6844579 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6844580 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6844581 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6844582 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6844583 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6844584 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6844585 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6844586 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6844587 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6844588 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6844589 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6844590 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6844591 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6844592 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6844593 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6844594 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6844595 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6844596 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6844597 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6844598 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6844599 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6844600 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6844601 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6844602 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6844603 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6844604 h sinais que a prefeitura cuiabana vem realizando propaganda institucional em per odo vedado bem como na realiza o da mesma se utiliza de s mbolos que remetem ao atual gestor
6844605 you had people here who didnt want to leave but after a few days of being stranded they were saying ok its time to go
6844606 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6844607 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6844608 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6844609 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6844610 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6844611 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6844612 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6844613 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6844614 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6844615 we wouldnt have come in this terrible weather if wed had an indication that they might close
6844616 the airlines should have broadcast the latest typhoon news in the airport and made arrangements for us to stay somewhere its the first time ive come to hong kong and now i have no idea what to do here
6844617 we are fortunate that the competition finished before typhoon nuri hit hong kong
6844618 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6844619 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6844620 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6844621 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6844622 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6844623 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6844624 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6844625 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6844626 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6844627 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6844628 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6844629 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6844630 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6844631 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6844632 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6844633 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6844634 y todas las personas que estuvieron involucrados en un caso que dej unos muertos por el camino presos y exilados fuera del pa s y es por eso que repito esta es una gran oportunidad para que la fiscal a saque adelante este caso as tenga que meter preso a un ex fiscal de la rep blica y se gane su medalla de oro
6844635 los importante es que el ministerio p blico nos diga si en realidad la experticia que realizaron demuestra que estaban forjadas y si lo estaban contaminan el caso de los autores intelectuales de los materiales contaminan todo el expediente del caso anderson y pareciera que hay alguien que quiere enredar este caso
6844636 el que escribi el libreto el que escribi el libro el que organiz todo sabr c mo fue esto yo creo que en alg n momento tendr que darle la cara a la justicia aqu se ve que hubo libreto fiscales que se contradicen jueces que escrib an la sentencia en otro sitio en este caso hay de todo puede salir cualquier cosa afortunadamente veo que aqu la fiscal a cit a isa as rodr guez y a landaeta y lo nico que le critico es que van un poquito lento
6844637 regresar cuantas veces me llamen encantado de la vida a tratar de ayudar en lo que sea
6844638 habr a que preguntarle a la se ora lina ron c mo recibi ella las actas que sac en un programa de televisi n

6844640 sco group has been ordered to pay a 10 000 7 900 fine in germany for making claims that linux includes intellectual property from unix
6844641 were in the business of growing the linux platform and making sure the development process of linux is maintained in a way that is productive and safe
6844642 one of the things that make linux work as a development project is the fact that linus torvalds who is the final decision maker on the release of the kernel works at a place that is not one of the competitors that collaborates on the project

6844650 necesitamos a azp rua y a todos los privados s pero ya se demostr no son los privados ni es la actividad privada la que va a solucionar m s nunca ni en 100 siglos problemas como ese es el estado y es el poder de las comunidades el socialismo
6844651 en 26 a os nosotros ya hemos pagado la vivienda con la mensualidad que aportamos pero el sistema de alquiler que existe actualmente la considera un negocio y no un derecho
6844652 la sensibilidad de nuestra instituci n hacia la uni n c vico militar es tiempo de que el pueblo entienda que los militares no somos una casta nuestra raz n se ser es el servicio a los civiles

6844658 los jueces de la corte primera de lo contencioso administrativo fueron destituidos por razones estrictamente pol ticas a fin de dar paso a otros jueces cercanos al oficialismo y al ideario pol tico del actual gobierno

6844660 some colleges may be taking environmental issues more seriously than society and some colleges are taking it more seriously than others theres a population of students that care about going to a school that is more environmentally friendly and thats only going to increase
6844661 the problem is coming up with metrics and a way to measure and compare how green a school is wed need time to produce something credible
6844662 wed have to educate ourselves on the different aspects of how to evaluate an institution by how green it is and there are a lot of different factors
6844663 if we had a partner it could start quickly they could help us develop a systematic approach and data points
6844664 our aggressive military activities in afghanistan are foolish and wrong
6844665 the pashtun people have extremely different values than ours values we may not agree with in any case but its not our business to try and teach them lessons with weapons
6844666 because in fact theyll be the ones teaching us lessons
6844667 were going to have to leave the place or therell be nothing left of us or of whatever weve done except the blood weve lost there after we leave so its better we leave now
6844668 its not done until its done and the discussions are really ongoing and ongoing and ongoing but hopefully drawing to a conclusion

6844672 ayala has been a nice shot in the arm for us hes got some big outs for us hes throwing the ball extremely well
6844673 right now i just want to concentrate on the present and what i can do for this team
6844674 i will miss toronto and the teams amazing supporters and fans toronto fc will always have special meaning for me because its the club that gave me my professional start
6844675 maurice is a talented young player and this move is a wonderful opportunity for him
6844676 no sean gannon will not be the opponent on oct 4
6844677 their game plan was to get in our heads tonight and rattle us and we did a helluva job keeping our composure
6844678 we knew that was their game plan from the get go i think we beat them at their own game
6844679 theyve got kobe said argentinas luis scola who kept his team in the game with 28 points and also delivered a few fouls the most notable to the face of u
6844680 theyve got dwight howard lebron james jason kidd you want me to keep going
6844681 they are so deep said argentinian guard carlos delfino who scored 17
6844682 you have to put aside your ego for something of this magnitude howard said
6844683 were playing for our country were playing for the usa not dwight howard or kobe bryant were playing for all of the people back home who watch us every day and support us
6844684 theres no egos we all want to win we all want to show that we can play together this is bigger than us as individuals
6844685 we knew what we had to do we just werent playing well
6844686 we got it together and went back to playing our game
6844687 he was telling us we were being too unselfish anthony said
6844688 we could win the gold medal in every single track and field event but if we dont win a single thing in the sprints and relays the public will view our performance as a disaster
6844689 when we drop the baton in back to back relay races the public views our performance as a disaster
6844690 we can be a much better team and we will be
6844691 we will conduct a comprehensive review of all our programs it will include assessments from inside and outside the usatf family
6844692 included in the assessment will be the way in which we select train and coach our relays
6844693 they all say more or less the same thing the dropped batons were reflective of a lack of preparation lack of professionalism and of leadership i agree
6844694 dropping a baton isnt bad luck its bad execution responsibility for the relay debacle lies with many people and many groups from administration to coaches to athletes
6844695 ultimately the athletes on the track are the only ones who can successfully pass the stick around the track but they need proper leadership and preparation
6844696 theres no denying we have had more than our share of bad luck
6844697 the public sometimes sees these things and sees only failure rather than the nature of the games
6844698 when the mens marathon concludes on sunday well still be the worlds number one team in terms of medal count
6844699 in the mens and womens 200 im not sure there was any stopping the jamaican juggernaut at least not when it comes to gold medals
6844700 nobody from any country was going to beat 9 69 and 19 30
6844701 we wont have nearly as many gold medals as weve won the last two world championships and gold is what gets it done
6844702 up to now the slightest criticism of radical islam on campus has been slammed as islamophobia while muslim groups and their radical fellow travelers have been allowed to say the most hateful things imaginable about christians and jews without any reaction from university administrators whatsoever
6844703 provost nikias has called the hadith on the msa website for what it is despicable given the atmosphere that prevails on most campuses today it was an act of integrity on his part to make this call and to demand that the msa live up to basic standards of civility that should govern the university
6844704 abu huraira reported allahs messenger may peace be upon him as saying the last hour would not come unless the muslims will fight against the jews and the muslims would kill them until the jews would hide themselves behind a stone or a tree and a stone or a tree would say muslim or the servant of allah there is a jew behind me come and kill him
6844705 the passage you cited is truly despicable and i share your concerns about its being on the usc server we did some investigations and i have ordered the passage removed
6844706 the passage in the hadith that you brought to our attention violates the usc principles of community and it has no place on a usc server
6844707 no one has the right to denigrate another human being on the basis of race sex sexual orientation national origin etc we will not tolerate verbal or written abuse threats harassment intimidation or violence against person or property
6844708 we commend usc for having the moral courage to stand up against those who hijack speech and religious freedoms and the goodwill of the campus community in order to spread hate and extremist violence
6844709 it also shows what kind of an organization the muslim students association is which is why the freedom center has launched a nationwide campaign
6844710 in confronting the danish cartoons and the dutch film fitna
6844711 we sent a clear message to the west regarding the red lines that should not be crossed as we speak the official west and its public opinion are all now well aware of the sensitivities of these issues they have also started to look seriously into the question of freedom of expression from the perspective of its inherent responsibility which should not be overlooked
6844712 from credible and unrelated sources cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
6844713 to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
6844714 to mention anything concerning a person that he would dislike
6844715 needs to sincerely repent because of the incident he caused
6844716 obviously someone wishes to join the ranks of those who produced the cartoons in denmark several years ago and it is an insult to all muslims of the world especially for us here in serbia
6844717 he is a young man but he should show more respect for his rivals that would be more in the spirit of the olympic ideal
6844718 he should shake hands with them after the finish line however he is only 21 and he will learn

6844753 these experiments are aimed at better understanding the factors that motivate consumers to engage in actions for the benefit of the environment this important topic along with pro social behavior in general is a severely understudied area of consumer research
6844754 join your fellow guests in helping to save the environment
6844755 our basic premise is that consumer purchases are altered by the portfolio of drink sizes made available
6844756 consumers who purchased a 16 ounce drink when a 12 ounce drink was available later chose a 21 ounce drink when the 12 ounce drink option was removed since now the 16 ounce soda is the smallest option
6844757 this effect also occurred at the large end of the spectrum people who purchased a 21 ounce drink when the 32 ounce drink was the largest size available moved up to the 32 ounce drink when a 44 ounce drink was added to the range of drink sizes available

6844766 the sympathy inherent to a close relationship with a victim extends to other victims leading benefactors to prefer charities that help those suffering from the misfortunes that have affected their friends and loved ones
6844767 so friendship with a victim does not simply make people more sympathetic rather it directs their sympathy to others with the same misfortune as their friend or loved one
6844768 arguably as the bigger more cost efficient stores move out the poor increasingly are likely to find themselves choosing between traveling farther to purchase nutritious competitively priced groceries or paying inflated prices for low quality processed foods at corner stores
6844769 stores pricing and location decisions in most instances are guided by competitive factors rather than any bias against the poor or their neighborhoods
6844770 one suggestion would be to explore the possibility of encouraging co operative stores which spreads the ownership among a relatively large group of stake holders within the poor community while at the same time increasing its operational economies of scale another possibility might be to consider joint ownership or management of franchises of selective stores in the poorest neighborhoods by the corporate owners of big grocery chains and poor residents

6846234 president bush has called on all americans to be more energy efficient private industry is joining the federal government in taking a leading role in this effort
6846235 does energy saving teams will play a key role in assessing and recommending energy efficiency strategies for some of the largest industrial facilities across the nation
6846236 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6846237 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6846238 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6846239 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6846240 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6846241 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6846242 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6846243 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6846244 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6846245 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6846246 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6846247 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6846248 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6846249 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6846250 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6846251 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6846252 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6846253 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6846254 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6846255 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6846256 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6846257 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6846258 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6846259 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6846260 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6846261 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6846262 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6846263 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6846264 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6846265 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6846266 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6846267 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6846268 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6846269 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6846270 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6846271 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6846272 this is a planning took where all things are going
6846273 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6846274 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6846275 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6846276 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6846277 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6846278 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6846279 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6846280 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6846281 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6846282 with these loan guarantees we hope to encourage creativity and ingenuity that will help us strengthen our nations energy security
6846283 projects eligible to receive loan guarantees are vast and varied we hope to spur investment in new renewable energy projects like solar and wind as well as clean coal technologies and efforts that can convert cellulosic biomass into ethanol

6846315 providing federal risk insurance is an important step in speeding the nuclear renaissance in this country
6846316 companies that take risks and enter the market first after a 30 year hiatus should not be penalized by hold ups that are not their fault this risk insurance protects them against bureaucratic and legal issues that delay their start up
6846317 nuclear power is safe it is safe because of advances in science and engineering and plant design it is safe because the workers and managers of our nuclear power plants are incredibly skilled people who know what theyre doing for the sake of economic security and national security the united states of america must aggressively move forward with the construction of nuclear power plants
6846318 the energy policy act has set the country on a path forward to increasing clean energy sources that will power our robust economy for future generations
6846319 through this important legislation we are expanding the role of nuclear energy and modernizing our energy infrastructure particularly our electric power transmission system to meet the demands of our growing economy and population
6846320 this statement is a clear sign of our mutual commitment to keeping dangerous nuclear material out of the hands of terrorists we look forward to working together with the russians to ensure that this important nonproliferation project moves forward in both russia and the united states
6846321 by signing this statement the russian federation is showing that it remains committed to the 2000 agreement to dispose of excess weapon grade plutonium
6846322 we have put in place a procedure for addressing remaining technical issues in the russian program we will continue to work with the russians to ensure that this important nonproliferation project moves forward in both countries

6846334 through this contracting process doe seeks the best possible management of this laboratory to sustain our cutting edge scientific resources in this highly competitive field of research
6846335 although no regulatory exposure limits were exceeded the consequences had the potential to be more significant
6846336 its important that these problems be corrected before a more serious event occurs
6846337 we want our contractors to identify and address safety issues before they become more serious problems
6846338 our goal is to have work conducted in a manner that protects workers the public and the environment
6846339 later today president bush will announce his plan to double our nations strategic petroleum reserve to 1
6846340 originally established in 1975 in the aftermath of the arab oil embargo the strategic petroleum reserve is a national asset that can be used in the case of severe supply disruption
6846341 the current strategic petroleum reserves holds about 691 million barrels of crude oil which is the approximate equivalent of 55 days of net imports by expanding our reserve to 1 5 billion barrels we will have an approximately 97 day supply of net import protection
6846342 adding to the current reserve will happen in stages over the next two decades to coincide with the construction and expansion of our facilities our goal is to have the expansion completed by 2027
6846343 while filling the reserve is critically important to our nations energy security i want to assure the american public that we will acquire crude oil in a manner that does not adversely affect the market or raise gasoline prices
6846344 today we honor the rich past of these sites that played a critical role in the cold war and celebrate the efforts to restore their environmental health
6846345 the department of energy has cleaned up over 1 100 acres in ohio and due to the many lessons learned at these sites we are on track to safely clean up five additional sites across the nation in the next two years
6846346 the fernald facility cleanup embodies the bush administrations commitment to turning problem properties back into local resources
6846347 together with our state and community partners we have transformed a cold war relic into an environmental asset
6846348 dedicated to the communities of fernald columbus and ashtabula ohio in commemoration of the cleanup of department of energy activities at these sites and of the critical contributions made to americas national and environmental security
6846349 it is our practice to review the performance of contractor radiation safety programs routinely we must protect the health and safety of our workers as sites progress towards closure and accelerate environmental remediation activities
6846350 president bush is committed to developing alternative fuels and energy saving innovations in vehicle technology not just for concept cars but for cars that can be publicly available
6846351 by improving battery technology and engine efficiency we can take bold steps towards reducing our reliance on foreign sources of oil
6846352 we want our contractors to identify and address safety issues before they cause a serious problem
6846353 these issues have been identified before and attempts at correction have not been effective it is important that senior management get involved to be sure that these problems are corrected now
6846354 scarlett y ryan lo est n tomando con calma pues hunter est centrado en la campa a de obama scarlett quien tambi n apoya al candidato dem crata quiere esperar a que pasen las elecciones

6846368 todays efforts to counter the spread of nuclear materials face serious challenges from those seeking such materials for potentially evil purposes
6846369 illicit efforts to acquire nuclear and radiological weapons technologies and materials continue to be reported at alarming rates there are real reasons for concern
6846370 the nonproliferation regimes weaknesses become woefully apparent when a state joins the nonproliferation treaty professes peaceful intentions and then abuses the treaty by using it as a cover to build up a nuclear weapons capability which it then publicly declares through abrogation of or withdrawal from the treaty
6846371 yet there has been no concrete progress over the last decade toward remedying that violation to the contrary we know that north korea was able to continue to make progress on its nuclear weapons program during this period
6846372 north koreas activities send a worrisome message to other would be proliferators but the responsible nations of the international community must send an even stronger message
6846373 we must learn from this chain of events and not allow it to happen again
6846374 and because of this commitment we desire to strengthen the nuclear nonproliferation treaty to ensure that those aims and goals can be achieved
6846375 so we want to buttress the npts underlying obligations while making them relevant to todays security environment and we sincerely hope the international community will focus its attention on this important problem in the months ahead

6846589 the commitment by gm and meijer is a big leap forward on the demand side and were hopeful others will follow suit
6846590 the basic framework and objectives for the two procurements remain unchanged and the material presented at the pre bid conference is still valid
6846591 the department is absolutely committed to accelerate risk reduction and cleanup at idaho while making it the center piece of a nuclear power revival
6846592 as the department moves forward with defining the scope and new mission of the idaho site it is vital that our nuclear energy goals and environmental management goals are clearly defined in the requests for proposals that we will ask companies to bid on
6846593 to that end and as we develop the departments fiscal year 2005 budget we believe it is prudent to take the time to make certain that the scope of work for these two critical missions is clearly defined and that the missions are working hand in hand thereby ensuring that neither takes precedence over the other we take contractual obligations entered into on behalf of the taxpayer seriously and we must ensure that the management of our environmental clean up activities and nuclear energy research activities is appropriate and well defined
6846594 on the nuclear energy side the office of nuclear energy is completing a 10 year site plan that addresses the infrastructure and investment needs for the future nuclear energy mission of the idaho lab
6846595 this long range plan is important to ensure that our focus is on the critical needs to accomplish our goal of making the idaho lab a world class nuclear technology laboratory we believe having this plan in place will allow companies to clearly focus their offers and match them up with our vision for the lab
6846596 it has become clear that there are advantages to clarifying both the role of other doe programs in the laboratory procurement and the work involved in our environmental management program
6846597 releasing the rfp in february also allows more time for the department to fulfill its commitment to work with the affected states and congress to resolve the significant uncertainties created by the idaho district court decision with respect to our accelerated cleanup plans
6846598 these technologies will improve productivity save energy and reduce environmental impacts in many energy intensive industries in the nation today
6846599 the department of energy is working closely with industry to help improve energy efficiency leading to americas energy independence
6846600 since his arrival 3 1 2 years ago i have witnessed first hand secretary snows dedication and devotion to his job and country and it was an honor to serve as deputy secretary of the treasury during his tenure

6846602 research development and deployment of hydrogen is central to president bushs advanced energy initiative
6846603 receiving candid advice from this committee is one of the many ways we are working to meet the presidents goal of moving toward a hydrogen economy and reducing our dependence on foreign sources of oil
6846604 the presidential awards for leadership in federal energy management established by executive order 13123 support president bushs national energy policy which calls for america to modernize conservation efforts increase energy supplies accelerate the protection and improvement of the environment and increase our nations energy security
6846605 this policy specifically directs executive branch departments and agencies to use energy more wisely todays award winners are leading by example and improving energy management practices in federal agencies
6846606 these winners contributed significantly to the energy and dollar savings achieved by the federal government and to meeting federal energy reduction goals most importantly the winners set great examples for the rest of the federal government about what is possible and achievable with proper attention and focus
6846607 as a nation we can do a better job of finding ways to conserve energy and these grants will help people and businesses do just that
6846608 every little bit helps and if new mexico as a state and the u s as a nation can make incremental steps towards more energy efficiency we can go a long way towards strengthening our energy security while saving money
6846609 investment in the development and deployment of energy technologies will help diversify our nations energy mix and sustain our economic stronghold while providing consumers and businesses with clean and affordable renewable fuels
6846610 the commitment of our automotive partners like gm through their leadership and investment in the research and develop of advanced technologies will help keep america on the road of advancement toward a hydrogen economy
6846611 solid state lighting is a key part of president bushs energy policy and the department of energys overall strategy to increase energy efficiency
6846612 not only does this technology have the potential to greatly reduce lighting energy consumption in u s buildings but it will also enhance our energy security
6846613 the level of interest expressed in this first competition was tremendous
6846614 that is a clear indication of the potential to develop and apply technology to improve our energy security through the use of coal our most abundant natural resource
6846615 electricity and fuel are necessary to sustain the publics health and grow the nations economy after a disaster that shuts down energy supplies the federal government state and local leaders and the industry need to work together to eliminate barriers and restore power our work in strengthening communications improving our modeling systems and coordinating overall response will help bring power back online as quickly as possible after a hurricane
6846616 we need a more robust energy sector and one way to do that is to strengthen and expand our domestic oil refining capacity were hopeful that motiva will continue to work to expand their capacity to 600 000 barrels per day
6846617 in addition we need to make sure that our lines of communications are up and running and that our emergency response systems are fully in place as we move into hurricane season im proud of how the department and the nations energy sector responded last year but we need to build on our success and i believe were doing that
6846618 one of the biggest sources of energy we have in this country is the energy that we currently waste by investing in energy efficient technologies government businesses and homeowners can conserve energy and save money
6846619 we have the strongest economy on earth and the energy sector provides the fuel for it to expand
6846620 under the presidents leadership we are working to strengthen our energy mix and expand our scientific might to remain the worlds economic leader
6846621 grants announced today can help homeowners businesses and government save money while maximizing energy efficiency
6846622 through research and entrepreneurship american businesses large and small can significantly contribute to our nations energy and economic security through the development and use alternative sources of energy
6846623 does goal to support small business is consistent with the selection of a small business contractor for the student diversity partnership program
6846624 does personnel continue to bring to the forefront technologies and solutions to improve the way we power our automobiles while safeguarding the environment
6846625 this new patent can enable lower in use emissions enhance new vehicle emission control system performance and improve vehicle operating characteristics
6846626 a year ago president bush challenged american businesses to develop new voluntary initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
6846627 the climate vision website supports efforts by 12 major industrial sectors and the membership of the business roundtable to respond with ambitious commitments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decade
6846628 we believe that the hydrogen economy is our future the questions we face are how fast this effort should proceed and whether it will be led by america or by others

6847216 twenty years from now when the principles outlined two years ago in the presidents national energy policy have transformed the energy world the energy security and environmental questions that preoccupy us today will be fading as prominent national concerns
6847217 native american tribal lands offer promising opportunities for renewable energy growth in this country
6847218 and reliable affordable energy supplies are critical to tribal self sufficiency with these awards the department of energy is helping accomplish two very important goals supporting economic development among native americans while helping our nation enhance its energy security
6847219 there are few greater challenges a college student can undertake than to design a state of the art solar car build it from scratch and race it 2 300 miles
6847220 these are some of our brightest young people and those who have made it this far have already proven they have the talent the fortitude and the determination to be a successful scientist or engineer i wish all the teams the best in this very demanding competition
6847221 i have reviewed your report of april 26 2003 on the future relationship between the university of california and the los alamos national laboratory i agree with your conclusions and approve your recommendations
6847222 in particular i agree that the vigorous action the university is taking to correct the problems uncovered at los alamos the significant value the university brings in the area of science and the significant disruption to the mission of the laboratory and the morale of the employees from early termination all make retaining the university through the end of the current contract in september 2005 the most appropriate course
6847223 at the same time the university bears responsibility for the systemic management failures that came to light in 2002
6847224 in implementing your recommendations i direct that any future competition include provisions to retain the existing los alamos workforce and to preserve the culture of scientific skepticism and peer review
6847225 the management of the nuclear weapons complex is my most important responsibility as secretary of energy
6847226 bring the coworker to your desk and explain your code by talking at them while they nod
6847227 these astronomers say i m distant cold dark and frozen and that i don t have sufficient mass they are calling me a dwarf planet and worse plutoid that s a lot of methane in my book i ve been a consistent franchise player since 1930 and now all i hear is what have you done for us lately they say the big planets in the outer solar system are gaseous and i m mostly ice and rock so what i m different diversity makes for an interesting team they say i don t have legs anymore yeah i been around the galaxy a long time but nobody has had to run the routes i ve had to run it takes me 248 earth years just to get around the sun you try it plus all the other planets are orbiting on the flat plane of ecliptic me i m 17 1 degrees off of that always have been if you can t respect that i ll clean out my locker right now
6847228 jupiter has 10 000 trojan asteroids orbiting in lockstep with the planet
6847229 pluto has a tremendous sentimental historical and emotional kind of attachment it retains an emotional hold on planethood people love pluto children identify with its smallness adults relate to its inadequacy its marginal existence as a misfit
6847230 futuregen will be one of the boldest steps our nation has taken toward a pollution free energy future
6847231 knowledge from futuregen will help turn coal from an environmentally challenging energy resource into an environmentally benign one the prototype power plant will serve as the test bed for demonstrating the best technologies the world has to offer
6847232 international cooperation is an important component of president bushs climate change policy and these initiatives offer a way to mobilize the global community including governments and the private sector
6847233 the forum is designed to build upon the leadership this administration has demonstrated in climate change science and technology our vision is based on the belief that scientific and technological advances will help enhance our ability to meet our energy needs while reducing the environmental impact
6847234 because sequestration may ultimately prove to be an essential element in limiting global carbon emissions we must have a global effort devoted to marshalling the talents and resources from around the world
6847235 every nation here today including both energy producing and energy consuming nations must ensure that our energy future is capable of meeting the demands presented by growing economies expanding populations vital energy security issues and environmental requirements the research and development as well as the discussions that will be held by carbon sequestration leadership forum will go a long way to satisfying those needs and do so in an integrated multilateral fashion our shared goal is to ensure that every member nation can reap the benefits of our efforts
6847236 i believe that president bushs leadership in this and other energy initiatives will strengthen global economic growth expand trade and investment and ensure our generation lives up to its environmental responsibilities we must leave our children with a strong notion of energy security and an environment that is as clean as we can make it
6847237 from his first days in office president bush has focused on the significant challenges posed by our national energy and environmental needs
6847238 like many of the nations represented here the united states has made hydrogen research and development a top priority
6847239 today we confront the challenge of providing stable supplies of fuel to satisfy the demands of citizens seeking the mobility and freedom that an automobile provides
6847240 we are so committed that over the next five years the department of energy will invest 1 7 billion in research and development of hydrogen vehicles and hydrogen infrastructure technologies
6847241 hydrogen can be produced using renewable fossil and nuclear energy
6847242 we are looking at all of these options but we intend that all our hydrogen will eventually be produced using emissions free technologies in our most recent budget we propose spending roughly 50 percent on hydrogen production from renewable resources
6847243 we believe our work on hydrogen and the work being done elsewhere around the world is perhaps the most significant game changing endeavor the energy sector will see in our lifetimes and working together with international partners we can leverage scarce resources and advance the schedule for research development and deployment of hydrogen production storage transport and end use technologies
6847244 such a partnership would provide the best mechanism to efficiently organize evaluate and coordinate multinational research and development programs that advance the transition to a global hydrogen economy
6847245 i am convinced the partnership will speed the day when consumers everywhere can purchase a competitively priced hydrogen powered car
6847246 will we move forward each of us alone in a manner that guarantees frustration and needless duplication or will we band together to significantly increase our chances of realizing the full potential of hydrogen i have every confidence we can commit ourselves to a multinational approach
6847247 we look forward to working closely with american industry and other sectors in fulfilling commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from a growing and productive us economy together the participants in climate vision will bring forward their best efforts best ideas technologies and industrial processes to reduce avoid and sequester greenhouse gas emissions
6847248 the industry leaders of america are answering the presidents call to work with the federal government and take voluntary actions to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and for that each of you should be commended for your initiative and leadership on this issue
6847249 the presidents plan recognizes the important role that forestry and agricultural lands can play in addressing climate change the results of the partnerships announced today will help offset greenhouse gas emissions
6847250 the commitments exemplified by the automotive and rail industries and the other private sector industries represented here today are exactly the sort of voluntary efforts that americans are known for and exactly the sort needed to meet president bushs ambitious vision to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
6847251 these weatherization assistance grants will save energy lower energy costs and increase the health and comfort of the homes of thousands of families
6847252 as temperatures are falling to sub zero levels the funds for weatherization assistance are rising to help low income families across the country
6847253 the president is keeping his commitment made when he took office to increase the weatherization assistance program and provide energy saving home improvements to hundreds of thousands of low income families this year
6847254 at current production rates weatherization decreases national energy consumption by the equivalent of 15 million barrels of oil every year
6847255 as we strive to reduce our nations dependence on foreign oil the importance of such efforts cannot be overstated
6847256 the true hypocrite is the one who ceases to perceive his deception the one who lies with sincerity
6847257 the true hypocrite is the one who ceases to perceive his deception the one who lies with sincerity
6847258 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing
6847259 john mccains campaign has asked a hollywood agent to sprinkle some glitter over his anointment as the republican nominee while barack obama frets about celebrities stampeding towards the democratic convention in denver next week even arnold schwarzenegger californias republican governor and former action movie star has stalled on accepting a prime time speaking slot at mccains convention in st paul next month he may even skip the event all together because of his states budget crisis
6847260 i ll start when the kids grow up or when i attain a certain amount of money
6847261 i m too old or i will wait 2 5 10 years from now
6847262 it was only by the grace of god that nobody was hurt
6847263 todays sentence recognizes the significant threat that gorbey posed to the public at large and to those government officials he believed had offended him
6847264 as the court noted today but for the professionalism and patience of the uniformed members of the u s capitol police this could easily have developed into a deadly confrontation this case serves as an important reminder of the risks that law enforcement officers take each day to protect the citizens employees and institutions of the nations capitol
6847265 i am very proud of the u s capitol police officers who successfully prevented a dangerous felon from inflicting harm to our community
6847266 we also want to thank the assistant u s attorneys for their outstanding work and prosecution of gorbey these outstanding efforts and the combined teamwork have resulted in getting a felon off the streets we are an online magazine for national international state and local news
6847267 but this is not just about low reserves or supply and demand imbalances
6847268 this is about real people and the real problems they confront when gas prices soar its about senior citizens living on fixed incomes being forced to choose between skyrocketing heating bills or some other of lifes necessities
6847269 this natural gas summit comes at a critical time because along with our discussions on things we can do in the short term we must also focus on the smart uses of energy
6847270 natural gas demand is projected to grow 50 percent over the next 25 years increasing our production and storage capacities is important but we must also focus on using our natural gas resources wisely and to our own best benefit that is another aspect of the discussion that ive asked the npc to focus on
6847271 our goal coming out of this summit is to take quick and decisive action where possible to diminish the immediate impact of lower than expected supplies of gas
6847272 i am pleased to announce today that the department of energy will soon undertake an ambitious natural gas data collection initiative that will fundamentally improve the way eia and our office of fossil energy gather and disseminate information about the use and origin of natural gas supplies in the u s
6847273 these regional conferences to be held in key locations around the country will be brainstorming sessions much like the natural gas summit
6847274 but they will also provide us with an opportunity to discuss expand upon and draw attention to the ideas and suggestions offered today these are small steps but necessary ones every one of which will make some difference
6847275 i am grateful that you have gathered here to offer solutions to a vexing problem and i look forward to hearing your ideas and suggestions thank you for coming i appreciate your service and so does president bush and the american people who will no doubt profit from your wisdom and counsel appreciate it even more because better information means more efficient markets and that means stability for consumers
6847276 jill has been an effective advocate for president bush and for the department of energy in promoting commonsense policies that will help secure our energy future
6847277 as a valued member of my senior leadership staff jill led the departments congressional affairs team that helped secure passage of the energy bill her knowledge of energy issues expertise and commitment to public service make her a relied upon and valuable member of our team

6847279 some happy news well i can now announce that partner tom starr and i are expecting a baby and we are very happy
6847280 as im sure youll understand we needed time to wait for results and tell our families
6847281 i will be taking it easy but am also excited to start writing for the fifth album i will need to take some time off to be a mum but before you know it well be back
6847282 everybody asks whether im going to be next or whether im trying i hate to disappoint people but the answer is no
6847283 secretary bodman feels a deep commitment to the former workers who led america to victory in the cold war
6847284 these screenings are the first step in improving the quality of life for our former workers
6847285 due in large part to the hurricanes that hit the gulf its going to cost us more to heat our homes winter but we can all do things now to prepare before the cold weather hits
6847286 even easy inexpensive steps like sealing our doors and windows can make a big difference in the long run
6847287 president bush has called on all americans to be more energy efficient as the largest user of energy in the united states the federal government should take a leading role in this effort
6847288 these teams will play a key role in increasing the energy efficiency of some of our largest federal facilities
6847289 frappuccinos gone i still do drink coffee but just with equal
6847290 my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape i have no sugar i dont eat fruit or even fruit juice because of the sugar i eat chicken and salmon and rice i eat avocados ill have egg whites for breakfast and sometimes turkey burgers for lunch i try to do just 1 200 calories a day it may sound like its not much but its actually a lot of food if you eat the right things
6847291 a woman who knows something about the link between sex and sport
6847292 the only difference between a whore and a toilet is that you don t have to flush the whore she flushes herself
6847293 germany had many adult entertainment centres during the world cup in 2006 which were very popular with visitors city officials say there are already young girls and women working as prostitutes on the streets of durban
6847294 it is one of the things that would make it the world cup a success
6847295 already in south africa anti trafficking activists say there are reports of street children being gathered up in readiness for the world cup
6847296 an estimated 90 of prostitutes are forced into the sex trade
6847297 open to meeting the sexual needs of the tourists attending the games
6847298 the vancouver rape relief and womens shelter objects to the idea of a co op brothel as it views prostitution as a means of perpetuating violence against women
6847299 it has been documented that many sex workers do not start out as ad dicts but become addicts to deal with the abuse they suffer because of prostitu tion opponents of the brothel say it would only perpetuate the idea that prostitution is acceptable and not solve the abuse heaped on women in an industry most of them dont want to be in
6847300 it entrenches prostitution as legitimate and therefore legitimizes pimps and traffickers said daisy kler
6847301 i do not believe the public would agree that this is a good idea to have some disposable women available for the olympics
6847302 calgary based the future group warning that vancouvers olympics will be a target of human traffickers wanting to exploit prosti tution the report titled faster higher stronger preventing human trafficking at the 2010 olympics said the federal and provincial governments need to deter traffickers from using the games to profit from human misery
6847303 studies show more than 90 per cent of women in the sex trade are not there by choice but rather because of trafficking drug addiction and societal problems such as incest
6847304 the majority of vancouvers prostitutes are native women and many of them suffer from deep psychological trauma
6847305 current discourse on prostitution would have the pub lic believe that it is normal work that simply needs to be better regulated
6847306 it matters very little to us whether we were prostituted on the streets or in the tolerated indoor venues and escort agencies of vancouver our memories are not of the locations but of the men who consistently acted as though we were not quite human we oppose any measure that would put more power in the hands of the men who abused us by telling them that they are legally entitled to do so as hosts of the 2010 games we want our city our home to refuse to take part in the global flesh market that is sex tourism and send a message to the world that women will not be sold in vancouver
6847307 said a brothel cant legitimize an industry that completely victimizes women these women are not in it by choice says fanning
6847308 fundamentally its not the laws that kill beat and rape women its men
6847309 says the reality is that the 2010 winter games will be no different than other olympics
6847310 legalization is no answer to prostitution it does nothing to restore dignity to the work of performing sex acts on strangers if it did then the majority of women in legal brothels in germany the netherlands and australia would not be women from the poorest countries in easter europe asia and africa
6847311 to combat gangs that imprison women and force them into the sex trade
6847312 hampshire women s institute a branch of the uk s largest women s organization
6847313 legalization has worked in other countries where women can work in safety
6847314 but anti trafficking campaigners have warned repeatedly that legalizing prostitution has exactly the opposite of the desired ef fect
6847315 statistics have shown that in jurisdictions where prostitution has been legalized such as the netherlands governments are reconsidering after rates of child prostitution sex trafficking and organised crime increased dramatically
6847316 in addition to the netherlands bulgaria finland and norway have changed their laws to reflect recent research showing that women in brothels suffer routine violence from cus tomers and pimps
6847317 the government has signed a european convention giving human trafficking victims 30 days to stay and re cover from their ordeal before deciding whether to help police
6847318 atrocities 18 000 women and girls trafficked into the uk sex trade
6847319 up to 18 000 females including girls as young as 14 are working in brothels across britain after being smuggled into the country to meet the booming demand for prostitutes operation pentameter 2 a six month campaign by police forces across the country resulted in the release of 154 women and 13 girls put to work as part of a lucrative trade dominated by organized crime gangs which increasingly co operate via the internet to maximize earnings from their victims
6847320 women is a frail thing for all of her strength
6847321 improving americas energy efficiency has always been a key goal of this administrations energy policy
6847322 these new standards will play an important role in helping to improve americas overall energy savings
6847323 while weve largely seen the best of american generosity and unity throughout the recovery effort we recognize that there are some bad actors that may try to take advantage of the situation
6847324 over the past week we have seen a sharp increase in the number of consumer complaints registered through our gas gouging web site by expanding the system to include a toll free phone line we hope to make it easier for americans without ready access to the internet to take action
6847325 as our nation grows so do our energy needs so we must be forward looking as we map out energy transmission corridors in order to get energy to places that need it
6847326 we want to make sure that the public is involved early on in this process and we look forward to this dialogue
6847327 as temperatures are falling to sub zero levels the funds for weatherization assistance are rising to help low income families across the country
6847328 the president is keeping his commitment made when he took office to increase the weatherization assistance program and provide energy saving home improvements to hundreds of thousands of low income families this year
6847329 at current production rates weatherization decreases national energy consumption by the equivalent of 15 million barrels of oil every year
6847330 as we strive to reduce our nations dependence on foreign oil the importance of such efforts cannot be overstated
6847331 we applaud clark atlanta and georgia tech for their commitment to educating and preparing the next generation of scientists and engineers
6847332 this is the seventh partnership that the department has sponsored between minority serving institutions and other university nuclear engineering programs these initiatives are important to empowering our nations youth to succeed in life
6847333 our new path forward will provide clear direction to improve safety and reliability as well as reduce programmatic risk
6847334 while this change requires coordination with utilities and the nuclear regulatory commission nrc we are confident that the simpler we make the design the more reliable the project will be
6847335 the old plan is complex and adds a dimension of uncertainty to obtaining an nrc license nothing like this has even been licensed
6847336 the program needs to make a solid fully defensible technical case to the nuclear regulatory commission and this change takes a degree of complexity out of the licensing process the bottom line is that this new path gives us simplification in design licensing and construction while increasing worker and public safety
6847337 i applaud the house passage of the gasoline for americas security gas act chairman barton and his colleagues are to be commended for taking steps to address the high gasoline prices we face by seeking to expand our nations refining capacity and fuel supply
6847338 the president has identified new refining capacity as a critical need for our growing economy and this bill includes measures to simplify the refinery permitting process and limit the proliferation of boutique fuels while maintaining high environmental standards the bill also takes concrete steps to act on the presidents call for new refineries to be sited on former military sites
6847339 the impact of higher energy costs on american families this winter is of great concern especially in new hampshire where temperatures are amongst some of the coldest in the country
6847340 i encourage all americans to take some simple inexpensive weatherization measures even small steps can lead to big savings
6847341 this strategic plan is the first of its kind and will provide a comprehensive long term look at the role for advanced technology in addressing this important global concern
6847342 this forward looking document will allow us and our partners to drive and capitalize on technological innovation far into the future the asia pacific partnership coupled with the technologies that we will develop will have a significant impact in addressing this long term challenge
6847343 our administration is very concerned about the impact of winter energy costs on american families
6847344 taking a few simple steps to prepare for the cold winter months and conserving as much as possible could have a tremendous positive impact
6847345 and this motion is expected to continue during the next 24 to 36 hours
6847346 over the next 36 hours fay is expected to produce rainfall accumulations of four to six inches 10 to 15 centimeters across northern florida and the surrounding region which includes southern georgia and southeastern alabama
6847347 i was unable to log in to salesforce from my home office last night it said i was not authorized to log in from that location see system administrator are we only able to log in from our office computer
6847348 the national energy technology lab is one of our most important means to advance research and technology in several professional arenas including president bushs clean coal initiative and carbon sequestration
6847349 carl has more than 30 years experience in both the public and private sector and has demonstrated his ability to continue the fossil energy mission of netl and to assume the directorship of one of the departments most important national labs i look forward to netls continued success under carls leadership
6847350 as a longtime boston resident i know how tough new england winters can be
6847351 because of tight oil and natural gas markets and the damage to our energy infrastructure caused by hurricanes katrina and rita consumers can expect to see higher energy bills this winter there are however simple inexpensive yet extremely effective measures consumers can take to reduce their energy bills
6847352 as a state massachusetts and its people have led the way in pursuing energy efficient programs for our homes and businesses
6847353 this year its especially important for consumers to know that winter doesnt have to burn a hole in their wallet families can save hundreds of dollars by following some common sense tips
6847354 every single one of us is a consumer in the energy market and are affected by any price increase but we can all be part of the solution by increasing energy efficiency
6847355 the greatest source of energy at our disposal is the energy that we currently waste so we want to empower all americans with helpful and easy money saving tips that will allow them to stretch their dollar as far as possible while keeping their homes warm in the winter and cool in the summer
6847356 winter nights in minnesota can be among of the coldest in the country so we want to provide minnesotans with the tools and information necessary to ensure that their homes are as snug as possible
6847357 the hurricanes in the gulf will affect all americans energy costs but by taking a few simple steps folks can improve their homes energy efficiency and stretch their dollars further
6847358 were all going to be affected by the higher price tag for heating our homes this winter so its important that we all take a few easy inexpensive measures to get in front of the problem through simple steps like sealing our windows and doors well not only be protecting our homes from the winter cold well also be protecting our pocketbooks
6847359 i like driving this track it is different to other street circuits we have had and yesterday when i walked it i thought it would be fun today just confirmed that impression for me
6847360 there are some very quick parts and almost everywhere there is a lot of room it is maybe similar to some of the north american circuits used in the past
6847361 they have done a really good job we have got off to a good start but it is too early to say where we are in relation to the opposition i think overtaking will be difficult as always
6847362 i hope i dont need to worry about it so i am concentrating on getting the best position for qualifying
6847363 considering the dustiness of the track we made a very promising start on the set up this morning we were able to go faster on each run without changing too much and had a good baseline for the afternoon session
6847364 in p2 this afternoon our adjustments were again spot on but the sheer volume of traffic meant that it was difficult to confirm immediately our final set up changes i think we are in pretty good shape and i am looking forward to saturday
6847365 the track was very green this morning which meant there was little point in making big changes to the car
6847366 but we made some in the afternoon and they seemed to pay off i felt the car was working well by the end of the session and the balance was good
6847367 this is a good start to the weekend for us all and i must say that it is a great circuit
6847368 this administration continues to seek out and develop new energy options to support our growing economy
6847369 the projects we are funding today are an investment in our nations energy security and economic security and will help us obtain the maximum benefit of our domestic energy resources in an environmentally sensitive way
6847370 depending on the circumstances breakfasts are limited to bagels rolls and croissants while proteins like eggs are prohibited
6847371 adding to the complexity state ethics rules also come into play if a corporation or trade association has an event where state office holders are invited the ethics rules of each of their states must be followed
6847372 millions of unregulated dollars are being funneled to the national party conventions through so called nonpartisan host committees these committees claim to be helping denver and the twin cities but they are really just using the sizable donations for political purposes
6847373 these are all the same people who have a big lobbying presence in d c and they all have major issues before congress and the executive branch
6847374 were trying to comply with the law and still make sure people get enough to eat
6847375 i am pleased that the national academy of sciences agrees that we are on the right path with our research and development we agree that this effort could lead to enormous benefits for the nation and the world i also am pleased that the report notes the promise of our governments partnership with the energy and automotive industries to develop advanced energy efficient passenger vehicles and the infrastructure to support them
6847376 i am proud of the work we are doing with our partners to eventually attain a clean and sustainable energy future through advances in combustion and hybrid vehicle technology and ultimately with hydrogen fuel cell vehicles this research promotes president bushs vision to strengthen our nations energy security through new technologies increased conservation and improved electrical delivery infrastructure president bush will soon sign historic comprehensive energy legislation that meets his priorities and puts our nation on a path to more energy independence
6847377 the members of the conference committee know that a clean affordable reliable source of energy is essential to continued economic growth and job creation in america
6847378 at the end of the day im confident that a bill will be delivered to the president that diversifies our portfolio of fuels and encouraging the use of renewable energy promotes greater efficiency and conservation improves the reliability of electricity delivery and providing for additional production of domestic energy resources our recent history of rising energy prices clearly demonstrates that there would be no better time to get the energy bill done and to the president for signature
6847379 todays announcement is a major step in the right direction as americas energy needs continue to grow with our economy further building our nuclear infrastructure will ensure that we can generate large amounts of reliable affordable emissions free power the companies of the nustart consortium are to be congratulated for their efforts they are truly the trailblazers for 21 st century power generation in america
6847380 in the aftermath of any disaster its critically important that we work together to restore life saving and life sustaining electricity to those people affected by the storm by issuing this order we make it possible for thousands of texas residents and scores of businesses and emergency services to receive electricity as quickly as possible
6847381 we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to ensure that the individuals affected by these hurricanes have the energy they need to power their lives as quickly as possible
6847382 in the aftermath of these two hurricanes the administration remains committed to using the tools at our disposal to ensure our nations fuel markets remain well supplied today i commend secretary chertoff on his decision to again temporarily waive the jones act to allow more ships to move between our ports supplying refineries with crude oil and towns and cities with gasoline
6847383 i am not thinking of next year now and will not until the end of the season
6847384 i am not talking to anyone now at all i am fully focussed on this years championship and i am not worried about next year
6847385 i think the team is definitely talking to fernando but thats the question mark
6847386 i have never been so enthusiastic about my whole situation with the team
6847387 i left ferrari because i didnt have the freedom to do what i wanted to do i have that at honda but i still have not had the car to perform and i am waiting for that chance
6847388 what can i say but honestly the day that i feel that i am slower than my first race is the day i will call it off and stop the conversations are there and i am talking to the team i am talking to all the teams i want to be racing
6847389 im not worried in a way its good the team are talking to someone like alonso who has a lot of experience and with good teams
6847390 they are going to talk to other drivers thats only natural
6847391 clay brings a tremendous amount of knowledge and experience to the department which will be critical as we seek to ensure an affordable reliable energy supply for s future
6847392 as deputy secretary clay will play a critical role in the management of our nuclear stockpile and the effort to continue s leadership in science and basic research
6847393 i am honored to be sworn in as deputy secretary of energy
6847394 i have great regard for the significant work and outstanding employees of the department of energy i look forward to working hand in glove with secretary bodman to help ensure continued excellence in our national and economic security as well as scientific missions
6847395 we are pleased to announce this selection to ensure a seamless transition and continued excellence in our cleanup effort
6847396 the idaho cleanup project is a very complex and technically challenging project requiring significant skill and expertise by awarding this contract we are one step closer to achieving the vision laid out by idahos 2012 plan
6847397 during the document review process associated with the licensing support network preparation for the

6847788 first of all on behalf of myself and the entire department of energy family i wish to extend our thoughts and prayers to those people affected by this terrible storm as with any natural disaster the first priority is human health and safety restoring electricity and fuel and doing so safely is a priority we began working with the federal energy management agency the federal energy regulatory commission and other sister agencies on contingency planning before the storm came ashore and we will work with state and local authorities to assist with the restoration of normal energy services looking at the broader impacts on the nation we are mindful that the affected region contributes a significant amount of our oil gas and refined product supply as we assess damage we will take the appropriate response the administration has been clear that the strategic petroleum reserve is a national security asset that can be used to protect american consumers and our economy in the event of a major supply disruption including natural disasters beginning last week we have been in close contact with our federal partners site managers at various locations of the strategic petroleum reserve and companies that operate oil refineries to prepare for any disruption in oil production as we experienced with hurricane ivan in 2004 the strategic petroleum reserve can be used to lend petroleum to refineries if they experience shortages and are therefore unable to maintain their production should circumstances warrant the president also can direct that petroleum be withdrawn from the spr and sold over the next few days we will continue to gain more information on the specific needs and then be able to make a better determination on how we can help
6847789 we continue to work hard to aggressively address the oil and gasoline supply interruption caused by hurricane katrina over the past several days we have seen the capacity to ship gasoline by pipeline slowly return so it is critical that our refineries remain supplied with crude oil
6847790 last night president bush took the historic step of directing me to draw down and offer for sale petroleum from the strategic petroleum reserve the initial offer will be for about 30 million barrels of oil however the presidents finding does not limit the drawdown and sale to only 30 million barrels or limit the drawdown to any particular time period the public sale process will begin on tuesday september 6 while we are taking steps in the right direction americans should continue to be prudent in their energy usage during the course of the next few weeks

6847792 two years ago american families and businesses throughout the northeast were plunged into darkness because of multiple factors leading to the failure of the power grid since that time weve made significant improvements but more work remains to be done
6847793 as we continue to improve our electricity grid the energy bill signed by president bush will greatly assist our efforts by increasing investment in infrastructure improving power generation and requiring a high standard of reliability
6847794 this years grants continue an upward trend in support of education that has been a hallmark of this administration
6847795 the investment we make today in the education of a new generation of nuclear engineers and scientists will pay tremendous dividends in the future of this country

6847843 it is with grateful praise and in recognition of her outstanding talents that i regretfully announce that jessie roberson has decided to leave her position as assistant secretary of environmental management at the department of energy effective july 15
6847844 jessie roberson has provided smart solutions to tough problems in cleaning up doe sites by implementing our accelerated cleanup program she has fundamentally changed the culture of the departments environmental management program thereby ensuring that this very difficult program has a roadmap for success at every cleanup site in the doe complex we have witnessed progress based on jessies commitment to success and commitment to improving the environmental management program
6847845 when jessie approached me more than year ago now saying she wished to spend more time with her family we were grateful that she committed to stay on for another year her considerable talents and can do attitude will be sorely missed at the department president bush and i thank her for her dedicated service to this administration and for her outstanding record of achievement
6847846 although i was planning to serve the full term personal family matters have required a change to my plans but i can assure you that i leave behind a strong and capable program in good hands much has been accomplished in your first term in office i am honored to have the opportunity to serve the american public through your leadership and vision
6847847 we are excited about our partnership with opensymmetry because they provide strong industry experience and focus in the sales performance management space
6847848 as a newer player to the spm space we feel that ngen compensation will make a significant impact in providing a robust option for companies looking to take their variable pay program to the next level
6847849 this years grants continue an upward trend in support of education that has been a hallmark of this administration
6847850 the investment we make today in the education of a new generation of nuclear engineers and scientists will pay tremendous dividends in the future of this country
6847851 this advance in oil field technology supports president bushs national energy policy by making maximum use of u s energy resources
6847852 this new oil pump allows us to recover maximum oil in an environmentally friendly manner while reducing costs its an excellent example of the energy departments focus on making the maximum use of our own natural resources while decreasing our dependence on foreign oil
6847853 you can compare it to conducting a medical experiment in a fully equipped hospital as opposed to a remote emergency medical unit
6847854 the innocent people of fiji continue to suffer at the hands of the military junta through reduced working hours loss of employment and lack of job opportunities because of the depressed economic conditions and the level of poverty in fiji were rising by the day because of the problems caused by the interim prime minister and his administration
6847855 to decide on a course of action that denies a number of our citizens an opportunity to work in australia and new zealand and be able to send back funds to assist their needy families back home is unhelpful
6847856 i feel our people who have nothing to do with the coup have been badly let down by our neighbours at a time when their help could have brought relief to so many
6847857 we have been following for a few years now and we are happy to continue with it
6847858 this is a strong message and to the people of fiji that we are targeting the interim government and its behavior
6847859 to slam the door at the forum and walk away is a message the eu will hear and fiji is looking for restoration this will also reach the commonwealth
6847860 the process brings to mind what happened in zimbabwe and we hope the ig engages and recognizes governments in the forum wanted to help fiji return to democratic elections
6847861 fiji has undermined its economy and the people by not returning to constitutional governance
6847862 his inability to keep to his promised march 2009 elections is more about the failure of the people he has engaged to manage the elections than it is about holding the elections
6847863 therefore he must accept responsibility for this and step aside and allow a civilian administration or national unity government to take over
6847864 it is absolutely unacceptable when the person doing this does not enjoy the mandate of the people whose lives he is affecting with every thoughtless decision he makes
6847865 for now he has the upper hand with his troops and weapons but ultimately it will be the power of the people that will finally prevail
6847866 just as the military leader in pakistan has come to realise after nine years of rule the people will ultimately decide their future not the guns
6847867 now that the fiji labour party has moved out from the interim government the time is right to explore the formation of a government of national unity gnu comprising of well meaning politicians and experts who could steer the country until we have an elected government
6847868 we request interim prime minister commodore voreqe bainimarama to listen to the people of fiji
6847869 we ask that the interim government should not be militarised if there is a need for more interim ministers then they should consider the concept of gnu which has been mooted earlier as well by civil society organisations
6847870 we are just hoping that at least we collect 20 more pints of blood tomorrow today
6847871 we are pleased the commonwealth has recognised fijis potential as a regional hub for the international office we will do everything possible to facilitate the establishment of this headquarters
6847872 fiji is suspended from the councils of the commonwealth and the commonwealth is not in the business of leaning on member states
6847873 for instance whatever collaboration programs there are that are going on for instance regional ones there is a regional environmental program of governance which will shortly be inaugurated there and it will be headquartered in suva

6847875 this is an important position and the decision comes at a time when the region faces important serious challenges
6847876 we will work closely with china and many problems in the region have come because of global challenges for example trade and climate change
6847877 the absence of a leader like greg would have consequences of some instability
6847878 in the past we have been having problems when pregnant women inginto prison
6847879 when the times come for the mother to be taken to hospital to give birth the child will later be handed over to the social welfare department
6847880 in the correction act the mothers has to come with the child so we have facilities for that now
6847881 children can stay with their mothers up to six years
6847882 the new born babies need to be breastfed by their mothers and it is important that the child grows up with his or her mother
6847883 and the social welfare department would decide whether to take the child to the inmates family or dilkusha home
6847884 that has been the normal situation in waiyevo and they have managed to control the situation there and look after the patients well
6847885 we depend on the public works department for electricity supply and the supply to the waiyevo hospital has improved compared to past years
6847886 we were surprised to see that the hospital still experienced limited power supply because we have approved of a 24 hour supply
6847887 an investment in our future that will benefit the nation for years to come
6847888 president bushs national energy policy calls attention to the continuing need to strengthen our energy security modernize energy infrastructure and accelerate the protection and improvement of the environment
6847889 it also calls for promoting enhanced oil and gas recovery and improving oil and gas exploration technology to increase domestic energy supplies the new projects meet all of these important national goals
6847890 dan is well known around the department of energy as someone who understands energy technology not just renewable energy but nuclear and fossil energy as well
6847891 dan shares our view about the importance of getting our technology out of the lab and into the marketplace and he is an excellent choice to lead nrel under dans leadership we expect nrel to achieve new heights of technical excellence and market relevance
6847892 dr pete nanos has led los alamos national lab during a challenging time he instituted a number of sound business practices that have helped los alamos remain one of the premier labs in the world while serving as director dr nanos demonstrated vigor and resourcefulness learned during his many years in the u s navy i thank him for his service to our department and our nation and i wish him the best of luck in his new responsibilities at the defense threat reduction agency bob kuckuck brings an enormous wealth of experience to this task having served at does lawrence livermore national laboratory and in washington at the national nuclear security administration i look forward to working with him in his role as interim director

6847915 the department of energys 116 000 employees and contractors have transformed the department from an organization generally thought to be one of the governments worst managed agencies to one of the very best and were continuing that mission
6847916 these bold reforms demonstrate that the president is serious about transforming the federal government into a responsive effective entity that can meet the service expectations of american taxpayers
6847917 the improvements weve made here at the department of energy are just an example of the changes that are taking place as a result of the presidents leadership and genuine desire to improve the efficiency of the federal government its important to keep in mind that we ultimately work for the taxpayers

6847924 grog sales are number one and food is number two
6847925 i put a food stall there but it wasnt selling so now it is a grog stall
6847926 we are selling the grog at 35 per kg and weve sold about 100 to 150kg
6847927 we are also selling cigarettes lollies and chinese lollies we cant sell juice because it is too cold
6847928 there is a couple who sells sock panadol and band aid and they make about 300 per day
6847929 i know this because they count their money in my shop
6847930 some of the residents are selling barbecue and sweets ive even seen beggars here selling roti parcels and bean
6847931 sometimes when the weather is good we can sell 50kg of grog
6847932 it creates employment increases our foreign reserves and contributes to revenue collection
6847933 one cannot overlook the impact of travel advisories the meteoric rise in fuel prices the stranglehold by a few on dissemination of information or more appropriately misinformation and significant demographic changes in the tourism market
6847934 these facts these realities pose new challenges they demand both the government and the tourism sector to manage change and make adjustments
6847935 our ability to deal with and manage change will be undermined if our strategies our policies and indeed our investments are premised on going back to the way things were
6847936 many people would die sooner than think in fact they do
6847937 the energy information administrations announcement today of a decrease in average gas prices is good news for consumers as we head into the summer driving season this marks the second week in a row of falling prices and reduces the impact of high gasoline prices on the economy
6847938 opecs announcement last week promising new supplies to the oil market along with recent inventory and import data are all positive developments in the oil markets
6847939 the recent actions taken by producers to increase production along with higher inventory data are positive factors that should be viewed favorably by the oil markets however we cannot afford to be complacent this nation will continue to face significant energy security challenges until congress passes comprehensive energy legislation that increases our access to domestic energy resources such as anwr supports the presidents increased investment in future technologies such as hydrogen and promotes conservation and energy efficiency
6847940 opecs announcement today is welcome news and when implemented will result in new supplies to the market this action demonstrates that producers are taking concrete and immediate actions to address global oil supply needs we look to producers to fulfill their commitment to increase supplies
6847941 supplies of energy consistent with the needs of a growing world economy are critical to continued and lasting global economic prosperity particularly for the developing world oil producing and consuming countries have shared interests and mutual responsibilities in fostering economic growth
6847942 opecs announcement today coupled with recent inventory and import data should be viewed as positive developments for the oil markets
6847943 president bush identified problems of tight supply and demand conditions three years ago in his national energy policy and called on congress to enact a comprehensive energy plan that would reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy expand conservation increase energy efficiency and diversify our sources of energy here at home
6847944 congress has still not done its job and we now face the third major energy challenge in as many years
6847945 the greenbrier plant is a prime example of president bushs commitment to coal
6847946 greenbrier will clean an existing environmental waste site reduce emissions deliver needed electric power at affordable rates and produce new economic activity it marks another step toward achieving a zero emissions power plant and will help us meet a primary goal of the national energy policy to make maximum use of our domestic energy resources while elevating environmental and economic security
6847947 president bush recognizes that a hydrogen economy has the long term potential to deliver greater energy independence by reducing s dependence on foreign sources of energy
6847948 it offers immense environmental benefits that current energy technologies cannot meet this multi million dollar commitment to research is a down payment on a more energy and environmentally secure future
6847949 the financial commitment of the private sector dramatically increases the probability of success that we will overcome the technology challenges in this important endeavor and achieve the presidents vision
6847950 the hydrogen economy opportunities costs barriers and r amp d needs
6847951 we are very pleased that the senate approved does scientifically sound plans to empty clean stabilize and dispose of nuclear waste currently stored in tanks at its savannah river site in south carolina
6847952 in short it will allow us to do our job better more efficiently and at greater savings to the taxpayers
6847953 this project also inspires program action to support rehabilitation and reintegration of ex offenders into the society
6847954 its the first of its kind for fiji but there are other vocational programs in prisons of small scale training at nasinu and naboro
6847955 currently there are eight prisoners in the art program and also took part in the methodist conference choir competition
6847956 we have inmates here who are quite talented and their talents are utilised in other fields such as manufacturing handicraft we have female prisoners who sew clothes and crochets
6847957 the issues that contributed to the water problems vary some were mechanical and there are parts to the plants that we have to replace
6847958 some of the parts we needed were not immediately available to us and we had to look for those which we have managed to obtain
6847959 if not the end of the year or next year we will be able to experience the fruition of those changes
6847960 with the increasing number of population the demand for water has increased but over the years the funds allocated to us to replace these pipes have been quite slow
6847961 our interests are no longer confined only to the traditional issues of salaries and conditions of work but have virtually broadened to other issues that also impact our work and that of the education of our children
6847962 our success in defending the social political and economic right of our people demands solidarity and unity from us
6847963 we are the voice in some countries that speaks not only for ourselves but also for the disadvantaged non unionized and many others in the plight towards principles of democracy the rule of law and respect for human rights
6847964 here in fiji the democratically elected government has been removed by a military coup and the country continues to be run by a military junta
6847965 fijian teachers association and fiji teachers union country reports may highlight this in greater details
6847966 i hope this conference will issue a resolution on the state of affairs in fiji other countries in the region such as tonga and the solomons have been experiencing difficult political climates lately which have no doubt impacted on the work of teachers and education as whole
6847967 my job was made rewarding due to the secretarys commitment that safety was his top priority
6847968 i am very proud of the safety gains as a result of his support we have strengthened our safety institutions processes and line executive oversight which has resulted in a 50 percent reduction in osha injury rates since the beginning of the administration
6847969 my family needs me now and this is where i need to be
6847970 bev cook is a talented and dedicated individual and devoted her civil service career to the department of energy she did a fine job and her exemplary service is a testament to the dedication of career federal employees who choose to serve their country
6847971 do not send presents to a judge or a magistrate and be careful of cultivating any special friendships with the court
6847972 of course the judges and magistrates themselves need to be on their guard not to accept and not to form such and to demonstrate such attitude to their staff and to the general public
6847973 theirs is a lonely office upon becoming judges judges have to loosen the ties of friendship they had maintained at the bat in order to keep a professional distance from counsel and in order to perform their independent and neutral duties

6847975 we have issued a strong statement to commodore voreqe bainimarama and he must understand the leaders feel very strongly about what he is doing
6847976 we are not talking about immediate suspension but we certainly want fiji to maintain contact and return to democratic elections
6847977 i think the forum is a fine sound body of a group of dedicated leaders who see a good future in the pacific
6847978 from my own meeting with the fiji interim pm commodore voreqe bainimarama i found he is a man that accepts very plain language
6847979 i only hope he accepts the message and helps to resolve the difficulties that are preventing us from dispersing our aid to fiji
6847980 we have an agreement that we will disperse our sugar money for this year when there is a clear path leading towards elections
6847981 at the moment there is no clear and credible path but with the plain speaking i hope a clear path will be defined and there are ways to go ahead
6847982 as a result of the review there has been an increase in penalties
6847983 this promulgation also links it close to the environment manage ment act
6847984 there is more involvement of authorities where they are empowered to enforce it now the different authorities are sure of their areas of work
6847985 the first of which is continued assistance to small states in addressing challenges by helping to determine persistent vulnerabilities by diagnosing creative and effective responses and in building coalitions of collective strength of small states in the global arena
6847986 we have made significant progress with our accelerated cleanup programs and we look forward to significant improvements in cleanup operations at
6847987 david garman brings an outstanding public policy and government service track record to his current position as assistant secretary and now in serving as the acting under secretary
6847988 david will continue to carry his duties as assistant secretary of energy efficiency and renewable energy while serving as the acting under secretary of the department
6847989 developing the advanced technologies that reduce our countrys dependence on imported oil is critical to the future prosperity of our country
6847990 our outstanding collaboration with ford has shown what industry and government can do when working together to develop energy efficient technologies for future vehicles
6847991 futuretruck 2004 is about partnering with government academia and industry to explore advanced energy efficient vehicle technologies and alternative fuels that maintain utility futuretruck has recaptured excitement among university students interested in developing automotive vehicle technologies
6847992 i am especially proud of the skills these students developed in making the energy efficient suvs a reality
6847993 more than just technology needs the engineers trained in bringing that technology into production
6847994 at this point all parties have had their day in court
6847995 doe will enforce the 13 seer standard in the interest of giving consumers and industry the regulatory certainty they need it is time for the government and for private parties to stop litigating and start working towards complying with the 13 seer standard
6847996 we continue to make significant progress in cleaning up the cold war legacy sites and we need the infrastructure to support this ongoing priority
6847997 we are also pleased that we were able to select a highly qualified small business for this project
6847998 i mean it has never happened before so where do you base the forum if fiji is suspended this will have a lot of implications
6847999 this is a huge crisis for the forum and we must understand the decision to suspend fiji is just a consideration by the leaders at this stage
6848000 i have not got my head around it to think beyond the decision
6848001 the eu has been following the forums lead as mentioned by new zealand prime minister helen clark
6848002 that is an issue fiji should be worried about rather than the forums proposed suspension
6848003 the countries are worried about the signal that is sent if the forum does nothing about the coup in fiji
6848004 i cannot see in my wildest dreams australia or new zealand doing anything on the ground in fiji
6848005 i have deeply appreciated the opportunity to serve the american public through the presidents and secretary abrahams outstanding leadership
6848006 enormous improvements have been achieved at the department in management environmental protection worker safety cost savings energy security and science
6848007 many new initiatives such as the hydrogen program and zero emissions coal have been successfully launched which will benefit the nation for generations to come having had the benefit of being closely associated with doe for many years prior to my service i could not have imagined these achievements becoming a reality our achievements have been made possible by the work of the thousands of dedicated employees of the department i am honored to have been part of the exceptional team that delivered these accomplishments

6848248 the first commercial energy summit in houston was successful because it brought together the major gas and oil companies from both russia and the u s for the first time to identify new opportunities for investment in russia and for improvement in its energy infrastructure
6848249 the summits provide opportunities for energy market growth in both nations which will improve each nations energy security this is international cooperation at its best with benefits for all participants
6848250 presidents bush and putin agreed that there were certain common imperatives in our energy relationship investment market access small and medium enterprise development and commercial partnerships
6848251 the summits have enabled us to move forward in each of those areas and assist russia as her role in the global energy market increases
6848252 the presidents hydrogen and climate initiatives envision fuel cells playing a prominent role in the economy and everyday life
6848253 for that to occur we have to reduce the costs of fuel cell acquisition and use these projects address the most important priorities identified by industry and researchers and were chosen for their technological impact and high potential for overall success
6848254 under this agreement both countries will cooperate on development of these advanced technologies that enhance our energy security and are safer less waste intensive and more proliferation resistant
6848255 this agreement is important to both of our countries and builds on key recommendations of president bushs national energy policy
6848256 these understandings open the way for greater participation by s growing nuclear power program
6848257 effectively and efficiently and with all necessary resources of our respective organizations
6848258 the united states is neither ashamed of its position on kyoto nor indifferent to the challenges of climate change
6848259 the united states is investing billions of dollars to address these challenges
6848260 either dramatic greenhouse gas reductions will come at the expense of economic growth and improved living standards or breakthrough energy technologies that change the game entirely will allow us to reduce emissions while at the same time we maintain economic growth and improve the worlds standards of living
6848261 over the next five years the united states has pledged 1 7 billion to fund the ambitious freedom car and hydrogen fuel initiative to develop emission free automotive operating systems that run on hydrogen
6848262 hydrogen represents one of the most attractive options to meet both our energy and environmental goals
6848263 it has a high energy content it produces no pollution when used to create energy in fuel cells and it can be produced from a number of different sources including renewable resources fossil fuels and nuclear energy
6848264 futuregen will be one of the boldest steps our nation takes toward a pollution free energy future virtually every aspect of the plant will be based on cutting edge technology
6848265 futuregen will lead to the development of clean fossil fuel power plants all across the world it will allow this abundant and economical fuel source to continue producing energy without its traditional environmental side effects
6848266 we will also need to develop the revolutionary technologies to make these reductions happen that means creating the kinds of technologies that do not simply refine current energy systems but actually transform the way we produce and consume energy
6848267 when those technologies are developed we will all exceed our targets if they are not developed then we will all fail
6848268 this is not just about low reserves or supply and demand imbalances
6848269 this is about real people and the real problems they confront when gas prices soar its about senior citizens living on fixed incomes being forced to choose between skyrocketing heating bills or some other of lifes necessities
6848270 lng is the same natural gas used in homes for cooking and heating but it has been cooled and slightly compressed into a liquid for transport and storage
6848271 the liquefied gas is transported in double hulled ships specially designed and insulated to prevent leakage or rupture in an accident
6848272 the global lng summit will provide another forum through which we can examine additional options to increase our liquefied natural gas supplies
6848273 we must focus on smart uses of energy along with using our natural gas resources to our own best benefit and expanding those resources to better meet our energy needs
6848274 president bushs clear skies initiative proposes to reduce mercury emissions by 69 percent by 2018
6848275 success of the clear skies initiative will be directly dependent on both the technical availability and cost effectiveness of control technologies applicable to a diverse fleet of coal fired electric utility boilers

6848277 hydrogen engine technology can have a dramatic impact in the developing world by improving air quality and energy security and promoting sustainable economic growth
6848278 the positive impacts are far reaching both in the united states and abroad
6848279 this project could ultimately hasten introduction of hydrogen fueled transportation into the united states by building upon lessons learned in widescale deployment of small vehicles in india
6848280 instead of burning gasoline the cars of tomorrow will operate on hydrogen the most abundant element in the universe
6848281 no gasoline means no imported oil and no problems with pollution or greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles
6848282 investing in our students today will help ensure the transformation of our energy future from one dependent on foreign petroleum to one based on hydrogen
6848283 its important that we begin to prepare and inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers who will lead the transition to a hydrogen based economy and build the machines and infrastructure that will make it a reality
6848284 the first car driven by a child born today could be powered by hydrogen and pollution free
6848285 hydrogen from diverse domestic resources has the long term potential to deliver greater energy independence by reducing s reliance on foreign sources of energy
6848286 the grants we are announcing today will move the nation toward advanced technologies that use renewable energy sources to make and deliver safe affordable hydrogen for fuel cell powered vehicles and increase the nations ability to search for oil more cleanly and effectively
6848287 nuclear power is the only large scale source of domestically produced electricity that does not produce greenhouse gases
6848288 it is therefore one of our most important energy sources today and has tremendous potential to support the nations energy and environmental goals in the future we appreciate the industrys enthusiastic response to our initiatives and the leadership senators pete domenici larry craig and mike crapo have brought to this effort
6848289 the consortia that have come together to pursue this important work represent the heart of the u s nuclear industry
6848290 we are very pleased that our nuclear power 2010 program has helped the industry organize itself to advance the prospects for building new nuclear power plants to meet our nations energy requirements there is a lot of hard work ahead and we look forward to working with industry to take the next steps in this vital energy security initiative
6848291 dr be r has made pioneering research and development contributions for 45 years to combustion science and technology of coal oil and gaseous flames
6848292 he has also been a major influence on industry through his publications and lectures to professionals at national and international meetings his leadership with students on university campuses and his service as a consultant to many power and utility companies both in the u s and abroad
6848293 the results of iter will advance the effort to produce clean safe renewable and commercially available fusion energy by the middle of this century
6848294 todays workshop the first of its kind will help establish a stronger professional and scientific bond between russia and the united states
6848295 russias interest in oil spill prevention and response and their growing participation in international oil markets make this workshop a vital tool in enhancing the worlds energy security even better the workshop will allow us to protect the environment while guaranteeing continued production and use of oil and oil products
6848296 a strong commitment to leading edge science is necessary in order to develop energy efficiency and clean energy technologies
6848297 addressing crosscutting science needs within doe maximizes the taxpayers return on investment in key technology areas such as solid state lighting membranes that produce hydrogen advanced fuels and chemicals solid oxide fuel cells as well as process sensors and controls
6848298 this new test procedure for dishwashers is the result of a joint effort with our manufacturing environmental advocate and consumer partners to make sure that energy ratings provide the best energy efficiency information to consumers
6848299 in the war on terrorism intelligence has replaced the cold wars tanks and fighter planes as the primary weapon against an unseen enemy
6848300 could inflict far more damage to national security than soviet spies
6848301 they are prone to low water pressure or intermit supply
6848302 as for the weekend supply that has all been taken care of on saturday when two water trucks serviced the area
6848303 for water carting there is a set program we follow in servicing these areas if they get water supply today then tomorrow another area gets it
6848304 but residents in that area know that these problems occur and many have taken the initiative to store water in large tanks outside their homes
6848305 there were only two trucks at the moment carting water to these areas
6848306 this was a reflection of a lack of transparent and free flowing exchange of opinion and data to facilitate in reaching a realistic decision
6848307 the committee further noted a pattern of defensive or no response at all to queries and comments made by the auditor general at the exit meetings
6848308 the committee also viewed the present arrangement as highly unsatisfactory placing government in a vulnerable position
6848309 i am surprised that the former interim finance minister is still running with his claims that the coup helped save the economy despite all evidence that the economy suffered a massive decline in 2007
6848310 as i have said before he is completely ignoring the fact that the economy declined by 6 6 per cent in 2007 and this has been directly due to the impact of the coup and the interim ministers own wrong policies of maintaining tight fiscal policies
6848311 i happy that the interim pm has decided to hold a mini summit and i consider it a good move to get the privates sectors view on some of the policies that need to put in place to rejuvenate the economy
6848312 it has gone through the tyraditional leaders of the province and through the nlc who has tendered their advice through the roko on how matter should be dealt with
6848313 but the villagers are just refusing to listen no one can resolve it except the villagers themselves they need to understand that the ultimately it will be the nlc decision that will be upheld so they need to accept that and move on
6848314 i really dont know what else we can say to them since this dispute has been going on since the 80s
6848315 but at the same time i plead with them to work together since rewa will be hosting the 2009 methodist conference and we will need all the support and assistance of people in the province

6848317 classic disruptive innovation where the mainstream dismisses the product and small companies have time to create a real differentiated value
6848318 this is not about low reserves or supply and demand imbalances
6848319 this is about real people facing the economic consequences when gas prices soar its about senior citizens living on fixed incomes being forced to choose between skyrocketing heating bills or other basic needs its about small business owners trying to keep the lights on and meeting a payroll
6848320 while we work to increase our production and storage capacity for natural gas we must also focus on using our natural gas resources wisely
6848321 individuals businesses and government each play an important role in reducing energy use
6848322 these awards are in recognition of your vision and sustained leadership of the international human genome project which culminated in the completion of the human dna sequence in april 2003
6848323 the projects success was largely due to your ability to join the efforts of two agencies the department of health and human services national institutes of health and the department of energys office of science this outstanding scientific and management accomplishment has opened the door to the biotechnology revolution that now offers such promise for human health clean energy and a cleaner environment
6848324 the suspects hired the van from makoi but they later tied the driver up and left him on the roadside
6848325 during the visit i had the opportunity to visit the major industries of interest to fiji in particular the ethanol industry waste conversion to energy projects paper making and low cost housing projects
6848326 i was very impressed to see how high quality paper is made from biogases and also building boards similar to maisonette for the building industry
6848327 i was very impressed with the development in these provinces especially in the fields of agriculture and technology which i had a first hand look at he said
6848328 in conclusion i would like to congratulate the dedicated and hard working people of china for the rapid economic progress that they have made in the last thirty years
6848329 this agreement provides the framework necessary to accelerate cleanup and it is a major step to effectively reduce health risks and expedite the environmental cleanup of the paducah gaseous diffusion plant
6848330 working with the states and regulatory agencies doe is proposing a new way of doing business leading to greater accountability responsibility and opportunities for both the department and the state
6848331 this accelerated cleanup agreement will accomplish results in a manner that is safe protective of human health and the environment and in compliance with state and federal environmental laws
6848332 this agreement emphasizes the bush administrations commitment to accelerated environmental cleanup and ensures progress long sought by the department and the state of

6848334 energy efficiency is an important part of president bushs national energy policy
6848335 these important projects will greatly help in achieving the energy efficiency goals our administration has set
6848336 this first foreign joint venture in any of the closed nuclear cities of russia will represent yet another milestone in the department of energys russian transition initiatives rti program
6848337 to date this program has engaged nearly 15 000 weapons workers its successes have been critical to safeguarding vulnerable russian nuclear expertise facilities and know how
6848338 this significant partnership gives us a blueprint for future collaboration between u s companies and the talented scientists in the former soviet union
6848339 even as we focus our attention on other aspects of our energy security including electrical power grids and crude oil supplies the fact remains that we must continue finding ways to ensure that coal our most abundant power source remains a viable energy alternative
6848340 the energy department has accomplished a great deal in the field of emission reductions and energy efficiencies but we will continue our focus on coal since it is a major part of the energy resources we need to support the nations growing economy and consumer demand
6848341 energy efficiency is an important part of president bushs national energy policy
6848342 these important projects will greatly help in achieving the energy efficiency goals our administration has set
6848343 we appreciate the knowledge and insight that board members such as james connelly bring to the table
6848344 we are pleased to have his continued service on the electricity advisory board
6848345 i would like to thank secretary abraham and president bush for giving me the continued opportunity to assist in keeping our electricity system reliable and for making sure that the
6848346 eias report concludes that the gasoline price increases experienced in the nation last summer were due largely to long term supply tightness and high levels of demand not opportunistic activity by sellers
6848347 president bush has from the beginning of his administration focused on improving
6848348 but last summers gasoline price increases and the recent blackout serve as stark reminders that we still have a lot of work ahead of us the energy bill that is currently stalled in the senate would advance many of our energy security goals
6848349 the first step to strengthening our energy security and providing better energy options for american consumers would be for the congress to pass the energy bill we stand ready to work with congress to complete this important work when it returns in january
6848350 imagine an automobile half the weight and twice the strength of todays models
6848351 as one of the lead agencies for nanotechnology research and development the department of energy is delighted that the president signed legislation today that brings us closer to that future this new science of very small things can revolutionize the way we produce use and deliver energy not to mention its applications to improving human health doe is proud it can play a critical role in president bushs national nanotechnology initiative
6848352 nanoscale research will in many respects represent the new building blocks for new technologies and applications across the science and industry spectrum
6848353 understanding the properties of materials on the tiniest scale will have an impact on everything from medicine to manufacturing
6848354 president bush has outlined a strong plan to address our energy needs
6848355 investment in americas energy infrastructure translates into jobs and economic growth
6848356 i want to thank senator pete domenici and congressman billy tauzin for their leadership in moving energy legislation toward the finish line i urge the senate to pass the energy bill without delay
6848357 congressional support of the presidents clean coal power initiative will allow a continuation of the government private sector partnership that has already produced dramatic improvements in our ability to use coal in an environmentally responsible manner
6848358 congress is to be congratulated for ensuring continued progress toward meeting expanded economic and energy security benefits flowing from coal use while overcoming environmental concerns
6848359 we are launching this new internet based system at a time when it is becoming increasingly important that the united states expedite its regulatory processes for trading in global natural gas markets
6848360 natural gas imports especially are growing and by improving digital communications between government and the natural gas industry we can streamline the approval process for getting these gas supplies into our market and to consumers
6848361 the task forces working groups and technical experts have collected and analyzed enormous amounts of data and information in compiling this interim report
6848362 an electrical outage of this magnitude is an extremely complex event and these investigative teams have done an exceptional job in completing the first phase of this review in only a few weeks
6848363 we hope these findings and the work still to be done in formulating the task forces recommendations will result in more reliable electric service in both our nations
6848364 we are pleased with the progress and cooperation shown on both sides of the border
6848365 it is imperative that we find out what happened and restore the integrity and reliability of our international transmission system the release of this interim report is a first step in that process
6848366 nuclear power is clean energy and we want to expand its use in the u s
6848367 it accounts for 20 percent of americas energy needs this phase of the program could lead to licensing and construction of the first new nuclear plant in this country since the 1970s
6848368 these generation iii designs will bring the nuclear power industry to the forefront of technological evolution
6848369 we are seeking the best contractors to assist doe in accelerating its cleanup in a safe effective and efficient manner to save taxpayers money
6848370 the release of this rfp and the resulting awards will bring reality to the commitments announced at the em small business workshop in july in
6848371 we adequately protect all of our national security assets but we can do a better job of ensuring that our policy and procedures are implemented correctly
6848372 i expect this office to play an active and authoritative role in the development and implementation of the departments safeguard and security policies they will also serve to resolve any questions regarding security policies and their implementation
6848373 the security safety and oversight team will work closely with all doe and the national nuclear security administration nnsa line management staff to implement safeguards and security policies ensuring effective programs to further protect does weapons labs and other national security assets
6848374 we continue to see significant progress in handling the claims filed by former contract workers
6848375 we have witnessed a steady improvement in case processing in recent weeks as we implement the changes we made earlier this year and received increased funding from congress
6848376 this program spans so many internal doe functions that we need to raise its reporting to a higher level to ensure the fastest possible processing of applications for assistance
6848377 the original estimates on the number of claims and the expectations set for handling these cases was inaccurate
6848378 to thoroughly and comprehensively process these claims as we assumed congress intended we must receive the support of congress and the necessary funding
6848379 our charge is to process workers claims and assist them in filing the best case for compensation when their case is reviewed by state workers compensation boards we will not shortchange the workers by providing incomplete or inaccurate documentation in these cases just to move the cases off our desk
6848380 im confident that we will pass a comprehensive energy bill in january
6848381 from day one president bush has focused on addressing americas long term energy needs to ensure our economic vitality national security and lessen our dependence on foreign sources of energy
6848382 for three years we have made progress on passing a comprehensive energy bill and i applaud the terrific work of senator pete domenici and chairman billy tauzin but it is past time to get serious and tackle the job at hand i am confident that we will pass a comprehensive energy bill in january that benefits the american people
6848383 we continue to work hard to aggressively address the oil and gasoline supply interruption caused by hurricane katrina over the past several days we have seen the capacity to ship gasoline by pipeline slowly return so it is critical that our refineries remain supplied with crude oil
6848384 last night president bush took the historic step of directing me to draw down and offer for sale petroleum from the strategic petroleum reserve the initial offer will be for about 30 million barrels of oil however the presidents finding does not limit the drawdown and sale to only 30 million barrels or limit the drawdown to any particular time period the public sale process will begin on tuesday september 6 while we are taking steps in the right direction americans should continue to be prudent in their energy usage during the course of the next few weeks
6848385 a situation in which substantial percentages of people who supported clinton still arent rallying around him after the convention would be a setback
6848386 i think he presents himself as someone who is practicing a new kind of politics without polemics who doesnt engage in personal attacks and character assassinations
6848387 thats good and refreshing but when folks are taking a lot of sucker punches at you youve got to show your supporters and undecided voters that you can hit back hard no one wants to vote for the guy who had his lunch money stolen they want to vote for the guy who steals the lunch money
6848388 obama needs to have a night devoted to making the case against mccain and the republicans they need a night to put it crudely of mccain bashing to make the strongest possible case against the republicans and their nominee
6848389 hes got to convince people that he has solutions so that means perhaps being a little less inspiring and a little bit more down to earth in talking about what hes going to do im a bit worried that the rhetorical atmosphere of an open air stadium with 70 000 people in it may tend to encourage grander gestures rather than the more focused discussion that people are looking for
6848390 its pretty traditional theyre just dressing it up a little bit more
6848391 you dont want to give the other side a full week of uninterrupted news coverage without anything critical so you want to make sure you have people available getting on the news to offer something else so its not like a one week long tv ad for one candidate
6848392 the republicans will primarily focus on foreign policy issues because thats been their strong suit so far
6848393 but if the democratic vice presidential candidate is someone without a lot of experience they will undoubtedly play that up as well and say this is an inexperienced ticket theyll take just enough pot shots to make sure their viewpoint gets out on this
6848394 we must solve the infrastructure challenges to develop a hydrogen based delivery storage and refueling infrastructure like the petroleum based one we have today
6848395 minister dhaliwal and i will start working immediately to find out what caused this massive blackout and to keep it from happening again
6848396 reliable electric power is the lifeblood of the economy for both our countries and its more than just a personal convenience its essential to the health and safety of our citizens
6848397 more than 50 million people in two nations suddenly lost electricity in this blackout
6848398 it put many people in potential personal danger it cost the u s and canadian economies millions of dollars and it inconvenienced everyone we owe our citizens an explanation of this incident and an assurance that steps will be taken to address the cause
6848399 this is not about low reserves or supply and demand imbalances
6848400 this is about real people and the real problems they confront when gas prices soar its about senior citizens living on fixed incomes being forced to choose between skyrocketing heating bills or some other of lifes necessities its about small business owners trying to keep the lights on
6848401 while we work to increase our production and storage capacity for natural gas we must also focus on using our natural gas resources wisely
6848402 individuals business and government can play an important role in reducing energy use
6848403 rocky flats helped the united states win the cold war and it is no longer in the nuclear weapons business
6848404 rocky flats is on a path to close under budget the hard work of all those involved in the rocky flats cleanup has helped beat target dates for key milestones and maintained the commitment to the american people of this country to shutdown and cleanup this facility this removal of the weapons usable material is a historic event demonstrating what can be accomplished when doe and its host communities work together
6848405 this accomplishment is probably the most important milestone of the rocky flats closure project to date
6848406 it also saves close to 2 million in security costs each month that can be applied directly to accomplishing more cleanup work
6848407 with the plutonium removed from rocky flats we will focus our resources on the final demolition of the site
6848408 this accomplishment will enable easier access to the former production buildings allowing faster and safer cleanup
6848409 energy efficiency is an important part of president bushs national energy policy
6848410 these important projects will greatly help in achieving the energy efficiency goals our administration has set
6848411 i am pleased to see the change in landscape of how legacy waste and materials are now handled so that future generations will not be unduly burdened with the hazards and costs of winning the cold war
6848412 i am especially proud of our workers in the field who are driving hard to move from a culture of risk management to one of risk reduction while keeping safety paramount
6848413 these achievements underscore the significant progress in the departments efforts to accelerate cleanup across the nation
6848414 these actions protect the worker and the public and reduce the total costs and schedule leading to site cleanup
6848415 these reports represent a sampling of this administrations initiatives to address the issue of climate change through the advances we are making in the research and development arena
6848416 the r amp d efforts developed under the climate change technology program will help us better define our technology challenges and achieve them under president bushs leadership
6848417 the rocky flats closure project is ahead of schedule under budget and making impressive progress

6848610 from the first days of the bush administration we have outlined the need for a comprehensive long term strategy to address americas energy needs
6848611 without this bill we are simply inviting more energy problems by refusing to address the reliability of our electricity grid thereby protecting the american people from further blackouts we will continue to witness swings in home heating costs and we will not have taken the important step to lessen our dependency on foreign sources of energy by investing in a hydrogen economy
6848612 to establish a diverse energy supply to create jobs and to protect the american people by passing reliability standards that will ensure our electricity grid is operated to their benefit we need this energy bill
6848613 today a bipartisan majority of senators endorsed the energy bill but procedural roadblocks stand in the way to getting a fair up or down vote by the senate its time to take down the procedural hurdles blocking this important energy initiative that creates jobs and lessens americas dependency on foreign sources of energy
6848614 congress has crafted a comprehensive and balanced energy bill that reflects the presidents energy priorities and will be an important investment in ensuring americas energy security and economic vitality i urge the congress to pass this energy bill before the end of the year

6848685 the department of energys advanced fossil energy programs have shown significant progress in finding new ways to improve our methods of resource recovery from clean coal projects to natural gas turbines and drill pipe telemetry
6848686 but as we all know fossil energy is an international commodity and the more nations can share their advances and achievements with others the more we can enhance the worlds energy security
6848687 the energy department is a good neighbor to the communities surrounding our sites
6848688 we will continue to work with the rocky flats coalition of local governments and other community reuse organizations around the country to retain expand or create jobs for workers affected by restructuring efforts
6848689 we are extremely disappointed and believe it is very unfortunate that the state has decided to go to court in an attempt to halt the work of the department of energy to cleanup the legacy of the cold war
6848690 as we entered our negotiations with the state we made it clear that the we could not agree to expand the states regulatory authority
6848691 in the course of our negotiations with the state doe offered aggressive and enforceable commitments to retrieve large quantities of buried waste to determine whether this buried waste and other quantities of waste are mixed waste and to treat hanfords anticipated inventory of mixed low level waste we also offered target milestones a type of milestone under the hanford tri party agreement designed to address matters of concern to the state involving activities over which it lacks regulatory authority for the certification of transuranic waste so that it can be sent to does disposal facility in new mexico however the state pressed to gain regulatory authority of transuranic waste which we cannot agree to by law unfortunately the state decided just this morning to seek court action in this case
6848692 the energy department is a good neighbor to the communities surrounding our sites
6848693 we will continue to work with the eastern idaho community organization and other community reuse organizations around the country to retain expand or create jobs for workers affected by restructuring efforts
6848694 our rationale is that to ensure the continued success of our enterprise we are constantly evaluating the size and placement of our work force including the ways we staff and prioritize work

6848697 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6848698 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
6848699 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
6848700 improving communication and cooperation among international energy producers and consumers is an important component of president bushs national energy policy
6848701 through the ief the u s engages in improved communications aimed at enhancing understanding and cooperation between producers and consumers and all energy market participants the ief holds great promise for promoting our shared goals in the areas of energy security market stability sustainable development free trade and open markets
6848702 our goal within this decade is to have this lab emerge as one of the premier applied research and nuclear engineering institutions in the world without losing focus on the cleanup work that needs to be completed
6848703 by separately contracting for cleanup under a new contractual framework the lab can develop and mature without distraction from other equally vital priorities
6848704 accelerating and completing the clean up work in idaho is an essential step in building the capability and infrastructure of the lab
6848705 fuel cells play a central role in president bushs vision of a new hydrogen energy future
6848706 hydrogen fuel cells will help free us of our dependence on foreign oil and eliminate harmful emissions
6848707 fuel cells today are being sold largely into niche markets where companies are willing to pay a premium for reliable onsite power
6848708 the presidents hydrogen and climate change initiatives however envision fuel cells playing a much more prominent role for this to happen we have to reduce costs
6848709 the selection of the contractors is another significant step in advancing the bush administrations nonproliferation programs
6848710 replacing these reactors with fossil fuel energy is critical to eliminate the production of weapons grade plutonium in russian and closing these facilities russia and the united states have enjoyed a good relationship on this program and we look forward to continued progress
6848711 these weatherization assistance grants will save energy lower energy costs and increase the health and comfort of the homes of thousands of families
6848712 this report misunderstands the facts and the purpose of the strategic petroleum reserve
6848713 in 2002 the department of energy took delivery of approximately 40 million barrels of crude from the market for the strategic petroleum reserve
6848714 to put this into context the global market for crude oil in 2002 was approximately 28 billion barrels the amount used to increase the size of the reserve in 2002 is fourteen one hundredths 0 0014 percent of one percent of the global market
6848715 in response to the disruption of oil supplies from venezuela secretary abraham has deferred receipts of oil since december of 2002 totaling 18 5 million barrels requiring that those who owe oil to the reserve will now have to supply an additional 2 8 million barrels at a future date
6848716 president bushs directive to fill the reserve and secretary abrahams decision to defer that fill during the most acute period of the venezuela crisis have had only one result strengthening the energy security of the united states
6848717 dynmcdermott has done a superb job in every facet of operating the strategic petroleum reserve
6848718 during its recent tenure for example the reserve became only the second energy department facility to receive iso 9001 certification for its exceptional quality management program
6848719 this outstanding record of worker safety and accident prevention took place in a period with the strategic reserve saw heavy construction executed several oil drawdowns decommissioned one of its sites responded to the need for enhanced security in the post 9 11 timeframe and implemented the presidents initiative to fill the reserve to its full capacity
6848720 this is an important step in advancing our nonproliferation programs between the united states and russia
6848721 replacing these reactors with fossil fuel energy is critical in eliminating the production of weapons grade plutonium in russia and closing these facilities russia and the united states have enjoyed a good relationship minister rumyantsev is an able partner and i appreciate his effective leadership
6848722 we are accelerating our cleanup programs across the board at doe and we believe that transforming our cleanup contract in oak ridge will further our overall cleanup goals
6848723 this new arrangement will provide bechtel jacobs and all of doe contractors and subcontractors the flexibility and uniformity to achieve the departments accelerated cleanup goals
6848724 this is a clear example of president bushs interest in and commitment to clean coal technology
6848725 this project and others that will follow will better allow us to achieve the presidents clear skies and global climate change objectives
6848726 the climate change technology initiatives launched by president bush are a top priority of this department
6848727 dave conover has the ideal background to head the climate change technology program and develop a comprehensive research and development plan and implement the key recommendations
6848728 making contract opportunities available to the small business community is one of my priorities at doe in addition to supporting small businesses this task order will support does continued leadership in expanding e government to secure greater services at lower costs and to meet the public demand for a more efficient effective government
6848729 americas small business owners represent more than 99 percent of all employers and their businesses employ more than half of the private work force
6848730 does office of economic impact and diversity is working to provide better procurement tools to assist small businesses by expanding and refining the procurement tools currently in place allowing more flexibility in specific small business programs and making the overall system more user friendly for the small business community

6848733 for sixty years the scientists and engineers of los alamos have played a vital role in ensuring the security of the united states
6848734 it is crucial that we restore public confidence in the management of the laboratory so that they can continue to play that role the nation needs the same confidence in the business management and security at los alamos as it has in the laboratorys weapons design and basic science
6848735 i expect the university to continue its efforts to ensure these failures are corrected
6848736 the laboratory continues to attract and retain the world class scientists on whom our nuclear deterrent depends
6848737 this is a clear example of president bushs interest in and commitment to clean coal technology
6848738 this project and others that will follow will better allow us to achieve the presidents clear skies and global climate change objectives

6848744 does commitment to improving management through electronic government practices is impressive
6848745 e government is about delivering results that matter to citizens using technology to make doe more efficient and effective is an important means to success in e government this is what i manage will do
6848746 our shared interests make us partners in the effort to devise innovative ways to improve the energy security in our respective countries
6848747 the u s and the european commission face common challenges including growing energy and oil import dependence and massive new energy infrastructure requirements our discussions will help lead to innovations across the board in energy matters
6848748 whether it is fusion a hydrogen economy or ideas that we have not yet explored i believe we need to leapfrog the status quo and prepare for a future that under any scenario requires a revolution in how we produce deliver and use energy
6848749 good reflection on the energy department its programs and its people
6848750 we have proven our worth by taking huge strides in carrying out our national security mission by maintaining our nuclear stockpile rebuilding the capabilities of our defense complex and preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and materials
6848751 this is a clear example of president bushs interest in and commitment to clean coal technology
6848752 this project and others that will follow will better allow us to achieve the presidents clear skies and global climate change objectives
6848753 this annex is a key step to moving our joint agenda forward to expand the use of hydrogen as an alternative fuel source
6848754 the increased use of hydrogen is critical to coordinating our mutual cooperation in the fields of clean energy fuel cell research and developing hydrogen as an alternative fuel president bush has highlighted the importance of hydrogen as an alternative fuel in his hydrogen future initiative and the national hydrogen energy roadmap so our cooperative venture with the eu will help tremendously in advancing our mutual goals
6848755 our vision for i manage is that each manager will have real time information to make management decisions and manage problems

6848758 e government is about delivering results that matter to citizens using technology to make doe more efficient and effective is an important means to success in e government this is what i manage will do
6848759 this is the time to reflect on dr kings message his courage and what he achieved
6848760 dr kings life and legacy demand that we recognize that although we may have differences we are all bound together as americans it is time to look at those ways in which we as a nation are better for his efforts
6848761 this is a time to remember martin luther king jr and that the struggle is not yet completed
6848762 not only will it infuriate flyers who are already annoyed with americans lousy operating efficiency and its recent maintenance likely to further erode americans on time and baggage handling rates
6848763 each other or other information needed for processing the rdf
6848764 this is the sort of thing that is going to just further undermine our confidence among voters in the voting technology thats being used very widely right now
6848765 theres already been widespread criticism of the touchscreen technology and the lack of paper trail which means you dont have a meaningful recount capability
6848766 i would expect that over the next couple years as we move toward 2010 and 12 well likely see more movement and maybe a further push from congress toward setting up some kind of uniform national system were probably the only major democracy in the world that has this kind of highly decentralized system now
6848767 it makes designing the ballot and coming up with an efficient method of recording and counting votes much more complicated
6848768 testing software is actually a lot of work and its hard
6848769 you want to get that out there where everybody can feed on it and make it really robust
6848770 our system is all open source its fully open to public scrutiny things that are glitches in the system arent going to sit there unnoticed for 10 years
6848771 this represents the fourth year in a row that the department has achieved a clean audit opinion on its financial statements
6848772 the secretary and his senior leadership team are fully committed to all aspects of the presidents management agenda especially sound financial management as that is prerequisite to meeting our responsibilities as stewards of taxpayer dollars
6848773 for the first time this clean opinion is complemented by the secretarys positive assurance statement on the adequacy of the departments management controls

6848780 the establishment of this new office is a significant step to ensuring the long term protection of human health and the environment
6848781 we believe that the hydrogen economy is our future the questions we face are how fast this effort should proceed and whether it will be led by america or by others
6848782 the presidents answer is clear he wants this to happen in our lifetime sooner rather than later and he believes that the united states and detroit should lead the way thats why the president is proposing to significantly increase our hydrogen and fuel cell spending to 1 7 billion over the next five years
6848783 for the united states the freedomcar and hydrogen fuel programs will mean surmounting the twin challenges of dependence on foreign oil and harmful emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases for the world the programs mean that whole new industries will be nurtured industries extending beyond automobiles for detroit the programs will mean a golden opportunity to help draw the blueprints for the 21st century economy it is a chance for this community and its workers to continue to be on the cutting edge in shaping the manufacturing world of the future

6848789 ken has an excellent knowledge of national security issues and the experience to guide him well in this important position the safety and security of our nuclear weapons as well as the reliability of our emergency operations is paramount in this world of new threats we are fortunate he is taking on this new role
6848790 this action keeps secretary abrahams commitment to accelerate cleanup in hanford
6848791 the site takes another step forward with the full construction of the waste treatment plant under our accelerated cleanup project hanford cleanup will occur more than 30 years ahead of schedule and this plant will play an integral role in that effort
6848792 this is a significant step forward for tank waste cleanup at hanford
6848793 weve received approval to construct a resized and configured treatment plant that will support tank waste cleanup 18 years earlier than we originally projected
6848794 were moving forward with a solution that matches treatment to the character of the waste and allows us to finish the job with a single highly capable wtp
6848795 installing the second high capacity high level waste melter provides the fastest surest way to treat the tank waste by the 2028 tri party agreement date the original phased approach simply took too long to get the job done
6848796 nearly 90 percent of the inventory in hanfords tanks is low activity waste containing hazardous chemicals and water with low levels of radioactivity
6848797 some of the low activity waste is well suited for vitrification and it will go through the treatment plant were evaluating the supplemental technologies and we should know in about 18 months if we can use one or several to treat the low activity waste that isnt so well suited for the wtp
6848798 an external independent review team has reviewed and validated the wtp cost and schedule
6848799 to safeguard against additional cost growth and potential schedule impacts orp has placed additional management controls in the bechtel contract prior to moving to full construction of the wtp
6848800 this will be an exciting year for construction of the wtp
6848801 with the approval for full construction well start to see these facilities come out of the ground at hanford

6848822 he confirmed with the ethics commission that in kind contributions and expenses must go on the next quarterly report because he did not loan the money to the campaign but instead spent his own money it doesnt have to go on the pre primary report as a late receipt he is not going to make any effort to recover that money from the campaign so it isnt a loan
6848823 i believe i can do it if i won the gold

6848831 in his state of the union address president bush announced a groundbreaking plan to transform our nations energy future from one dependent on petroleum to one that utilizes the most abundant element in the universe hydrogen
6848832 this solicitation is an important step toward fulfilling the presidents vision that the first car of a child born today will be powered by hydrogen
6848833 i commend our employees who in their off time have committed to giving to others
6848834 president bush has called on america to give back to the country through volunteerism and i am proud that so many of does employees have heeded that call
6848835 many of our employees have been volunteering for years in their communities and around the world
6848836 i feel the department should recognize those who give so much to so many
6848837 we are doing all we can to find workers or their families who may be eligible for assistance under this program
6848838 these men and women performed an important service for their country and we want them to receive the benefits owed to them
6848839 this action supports president bushs call for accelerated cleanup of legacy waste
6848840 under secretary abrahams leadership this is another significant step doe is taking to demonstrate its commitment to accelerating environmental cleanup at hanford
6848841 while my hair was styled for the ceremony i thought of ways to set fire to my wedding dress
6848842 when i protested my dad gagged me and tied me up after the wedding i tried to kill myself twice
6848843 early marriages are universal in yemen because of the cultural premium placed on shaping a young bride to meet the husbands needs
6848844 tribal leaders and imams have more influence than the state but its important to amend our marriage laws to create a benchmark we need a new place to start from
6848845 theres an avalanche of factors working against the girl child we should be on a war footing to save young girls from the inferno of child marriage
6848846 even powerful families arrange alliance marriages by bartering their daughters into the power structures at an early age but girls from the poorest families are most at risk
6848847 the cards are stacked against the girl child and those shuffling the cards dont even understand the risks to their sisters and daughters
6848848 we have to establish a trust to look after the girls interests over the next few years we need to find a model that will work for all victims of early marriage
6848849 these weatherization assistance grants will save energy lower energy costs and increase the health and comfort of the homes of thousands of families
6848850 energy efficiency is an important part of president bushs national energy policy
6848851 these important projects will greatly help in achieving the energy efficiency goals our administration has set
6848852 these weatherization assistance grants will save energy lower energy costs and increase the health and comfort of the homes of thousands of families
6848853 the new york city clean cities coalition has made great progress in promoting the use of alternative fuel and alternative fuel vehicles
6848854 their efforts to increase the use of domestically produced cleaner burning alternative fuels such as ethanol natural gas propane biodiesel and electricity are helping to reduce our nations dependence on imported oil strengthen energy security and improve our environment
6848855 as president bushs national energy policy emphasized the oil and gas industry has made remarkable advances in the last 40 years to shrink the footprint of its operations
6848856 the arctic platform could be the industrys next major step toward the day when exploration and drilling would leave virtually no lasting trace on the surface
6848857 we saw what could be the drilling platform of tomorrow tapping the energy resource of tomorrow
6848858 the arctic platform could offer a solution to the difficult drilling and production challenges we face in environmentally sensitive areas
6848859 because the platform is elevated off the tundra it could eliminate the need for gravel pads thereby minimizing surface disturbance and eliminating the need to build temporary ice roads each season to access the drill site this means that we could safely extend the window when we can conduct oil and gas operations above the arctic circle because we would not be limited to winter months when the tundra is frozen
6848860 if we can learn how to extract the natural gas trapped in hydrates economically we could dramatically strengthen the nations future energy security
6848861 and if we can tap this enormous resource in a way that minimizes the impact on fragile ecosystems we can take a major step toward both our energy and environmental goals
6848862 good reflection on the energy department its programs and its people
6848863 we have proven our worth by taking huge strides in carrying out our national security mission by maintaining our nuclear stockpile rebuilding the capabilities of our defense complex and preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and materials
6848864 we are proud to help ensure that our law enforcement and emergency personnel have the necessary equipment and training to prepare them to respond effectively and thoroughly to any emergency
6848865 and we are pleased to provide doe resources to help ensure americas homeland defense
6848866 the hder program is an excellent example of federal agencies working together to address a critical homeland security issue
6848867 recent actions by the state of washington could have a chilling effect on cleanup operations at hanford and elsewhere the department of energy has fundamentally changed the cleanup program for every site in the country our balanced and integrated cleanup approach is making progress washingtons recent actions run counter to our accelerated cleanup goals
6848868 washington was the first state to sign up to the does accelerated clean up program but we are not sure the state understands the unintended consequences of its recent actions which could call shipments of transuranic waste around the country into question not just shipments of waste into washington but also shipments of waste out of washington
6848869 some groups would like for you to believe that the shipment of waste is unsafe it is not shipments are highly regulated and safe in fact it is disingenuous for those groups to make statements that shipments of waste going into washington are not safe but those going out of washington are safe
6848870 we believe we can work with the state on this issue to an eventual agreement but in light of washingtons actions we felt we had to file this lawsuit to protect out interests
6848871 a pair of kerouacs armed with sharpies and erasers and righteous indignation
6848872 discovered a hand rendered sign inside that i regret to report contained a few errors

6848880 destacamos tambi n el anuncio relativo a las peque as y medianas empresas que obviamente necesitan un apoyo considerando que adem s son la principal fuente generadora de empleo
6848881 the energy department just completed a natural gas summit last month in which we discussed the lack of lng terminals in the
6848882 i think cove point will become a major player in expanding our access to this vital energy resource and in increasing our energy security i have also called for a global lng summit to provide another forum through which we can examine additional options to increase our liquefied natural gas supplies these actions along with smart uses of energy will mean we can better meet our energy needs
6848883 natural gas demand is projected to grow 50 percent over the next 25 years
6848884 increasing our production and storage capacities is important but we must also focus on using our natural gas resources wisely and to our own best benefit that is another aspect of the issue that doe is focusing on
6848885 but our actions are not just about low reserves or supply and demand imbalances
6848886 this is about real people and the real problems they confront when gas prices soar its about senior citizens living on fixed incomes being forced to choose between skyrocketing heating bills or some other of lifes necessities along with our discussions on things we can do in the short term we must also focus on the smart uses of energy
6848887 we began with a simple idea gps on mobile handsets would free our dispatchers from having to constantly call out to the trucks and ask where are you
6848888 then we saw all this data coming in and realized we could use it to tackle much more challenging problems
6848889 for example we use cumulative gps route data to analyze where to park trucks based on expected demand and we use the gps database to optimize our staffing and shifts to ensure all parts of our region receive appropriate service and that employees can reach their assigned vehicles efficiently
6848890 were looking into optimizing routes to save on fuel and were tightening up our operation in many other ways all from this constantly expanding body of information all our work with mobility translates directly into improved profit margins and better service quality

6848893 fans that have had their tickets for 40 to 50 years are being asked to pay up to 20 000 per seat for the right to remain as a season ticket holder some of those same fans are also asked to pay up to 700 per ticket per game for tickets to the game
6848894 for a family of four that sits on the 45 yard line that is middle class the only luxury item in their lives is that they have giants season tickets
6848895 the previous 12 nfl teams which implemented psls have averaged 75 million in revenue from the sale of their psls the giants and jets will be raising a combined 740 million or close to 10 times the average of any other stadium that has used psls
6848896 it does not seem fair to me to burden your most loyal fans with psls of this value
6848897 they are selling their psls for substantially below market value
6848898 true and loyal fans do not look on their season tickets as an investment
6848899 ive had my jets tickets for 15 years i have three young sons that are all jets fans true fans will not be selling their season tickets and therefore will not see any return on their so called investment
6848900 we want to market the institution as a whole but were also looking at it in pieces to see where we can get the most value
6848901 its good that the government stepped in when it did
6848902 i think fewer banks will go under because of the way indymac was handled
6848903 the one way forward for this country is to develop renewable energy
6848904 the federal reserve is paying close attention to the economy and is acting very forcefully to protect us all
6848905 the future is not particularly bright right now but on the plus side energy problems do lead to a lot of innovation innovation with windmills and mechanical technology and agricultural technology
6848906 im not particularly hopeful that our economic policy will be guided by a well thought out plan
6848907 its more of a band aid approach like lets patch this up over here there are a lot of people in a lot of pain economically
6848908 if you do not want to change your driving will continue to present a risk
6848909 we are accelerating our cleanup programs across the board at doe and we believe that transforming our cleanup contract in oak ridge will further our overall cleanup goals
6848910 this new arrangement will provide bechtel jacobs and all of doe contractors and subcontractors the flexibility and uniformity to achieve the departments accelerated cleanup goals
6848911 we are extremely disappointed and believe it is very unfortunate that the state has decided to go to court in an attempt to halt the work of the department of energy to cleanup the legacy of the cold war
6848912 as we entered our negotiations with the state we made it clear that the we could not agree to expand the states regulatory authority
6848913 in the course of our negotiations with the state doe offered aggressive and enforceable commitments to retrieve large quantities of buried waste to determine whether this buried waste and other quantities of waste are mixed waste and to treat hanfords anticipated inventory of mixed low level waste we also offered target milestones a type of milestone under the hanford tri party agreement designed to address matters of concern to the state involving activities over which it lacks regulatory authority for the certification of transuranic waste so that it can be sent to does disposal facility in new mexico however the state pressed to gain regulatory authority of transuranic waste which we cannot agree to by law unfortunately the state decided just this morning to seek court action in this case

6848925 its a long season and we need a good squad to cope with that
6848926 i am confident that tom rollow has the leadership skills that are necessary to manage and fulfill the duties of the worker advocacy office
6848927 his knowledge of the doe complex combined with his strong project management skills will be invaluable to the office
6848928 the energy department is a good neighbor to the communities surrounding our sites
6848929 we will continue to work with the eastern idaho community organization and other community reuse organizations around the country to retain expand or create jobs for workers affected by restructuring efforts
6848930 our shared interests make us partners in the effort to devise innovative ways to improve the energy security in our respective countries
6848931 the u s and the european commission face common challenges including growing energy and oil import dependence and massive new energy infrastructure requirements our discussions will help lead to innovations across the board in energy matters
6848932 whether it is fusion a hydrogen economy or ideas that we have not yet explored i believe we need to leapfrog the status quo and prepare for a future that under any scenario requires a revolution in how we produce deliver and use energy
6848933 this annex is a key step to moving our joint agenda forward to expand the use of hydrogen as an alternative fuel source
6848934 the increased use of hydrogen is critical to coordinating our mutual cooperation in the fields of clean energy fuel cell research and developing hydrogen as an alternative fuel president bush has highlighted the importance of hydrogen as an alternative fuel in his hydrogen future initiative and the national hydrogen energy roadmap so our cooperative venture with the eu will help tremendously in advancing our mutual goals
6848935 jeffs experience and familiarity of doe nuclear facilities including chemical processing facilities waste management facilities and laboratories make him ideally suited to lead the departments savannah river operations office
6848936 unique microbial biochemistries amassed over eons in every niche on the planet now offer a virtually limitless resource that can be applied to develop biology based solutions to these challenges
6848937 the gtl programs goal is to understand microbes so well that their diverse capabilities can be harnessed for doe and other national energy and environmental needs
6848938 these grants will help states improve energy efficiency in ways that meet their individual needs
6848939 increasing americas energy efficiency is a key component of president bushs national energy policy
6848940 the members of the conference committee know that a clean affordable reliable source of energy is essential to continued economic growth and job creation in america
6848941 this is an important step in advancing our nonproliferation programs between the united states and russia
6848942 replacing these reactors with fossil fuel energy is critical in eliminating the production of weapons grade plutonium in russia and closing these facilities russia and the united states have enjoyed a good relationship minister rumyantsev is an able partner and i appreciate his effective leadership
6848943 well the lad has got two tremendous clubs to pick from if his dads right
6848944 we are looking for three more players to come in before the deadline but they have got to be the right players

6848947 what has concerned us is the violence the disruptions that has led us to be concerned about the safety of our employees our equipment and investment and of the viability of the process
6848948 its not done until its done and the discussions are really ongoing and ongoing and ongoing but hopefully drawing to a conclusion
6848949 many of the people locked inside washingtons beltway tend to forget just where our energy comes from they forget that its the end result of a long process that began in the mines and coal fields in places like west virginia
6848950 coal is our most abundant source of energy and the university coal research program helps us identify new ways to utilize coal in a more efficient and environmentally responsible way
6848951 the continued use of coal will have a number of very concrete benefits it will help support the economy of the great state of west virginia it will help lead us to a stable secure energy future at a time when we know our economys appetite for electricity will grow and it will help us safeguard our skies and rivers and other environmental treasures
6848952 the national energy technology lab is one of our most important means to advance research and technology in several professional arenas including president bushs clean coal initiative and carbon sequestration
6848953 carl has more than 30 years experience in both the public and private sector and has demonstrated his ability to continue the fossil energy mission of netl and to assume the directorship of one of the departments most important national labs i look forward to netls continued success under carls leadership

6848956 world energy supplies are more than adequate to compensate for any disruption
6848957 the united states and our international energy agency partners are determined to foster stability in world oil markets
6848958 we note that producing countries especially saudi arabia have been significantly increasing production and tanker loadings in recent weeks
6848959 we welcome additional steps by producing countries to make additional supply immediately available to the market as a precautionary measure
6848960 we welcome announcements by opec and major producers like saudi arabia today that they will act to prevent any shortage
6848961 united states officials are in close contact with our iea partners to assess global oil market conditions i have been and remain in regular contact with both our iea partners and producers
6848962 the united states holds 599 million barrels of oil in reserve together iea governments hold 1 2 billion barrels of oil in reserve
6848963 i am confident that increased supplies already on the water the response by opec and major producers like saudi arabia and if needed our large strategic stockpiles will ensure that our economy will have the ample supply of energy it needs
6848964 the united states and its international partners anticipate that saddam husseins regime might attempt acts of sabotage against oil wells by doing so saddam is destroying the wealth of his own people
6848965 world energy supplies are more than adequate to compensate for any disruption these acts may cause
6848966 as the president has said those responsible for acts of sabotage will be held to account for their crimes anyone who receives an order of sabotage from the iraqi regime should not follow those orders
6848967 in the aftermath of any disaster its critically important that we work together to restore life saving and life sustaining electricity to those people affected by the storm by issuing this order we make it possible for thousands of texas residents and scores of businesses and emergency services to receive electricity as quickly as possible
6848968 we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to ensure that the individuals affected by these hurricanes have the energy they need to power their lives as quickly as possible
6848969 our idaho site plays an important role in a variety of doe missions and beth sellers experience in managing environmental cleanup and her background in nuclear energy projects will be a great asset to our operations at the site
6848970 i appreciate this unique opportunity to participate in formulating and implementing a new future for the idaho site
6848971 many of the exciting nuclear technology initiatives the department has announced over the last two years will be centered in idaho and im looking forward to being a part of this important work for many years to come
6848972 at the same time this legislation helps protect our environment by supporting the development and deployment of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power encouraging the construction of clean safe nuclear power plants and promoting research and development efforts to transform that way we produce and use energy in the future todays action is a victory for the american people
6848973 kanye was still grinding it out when i was grinding it out we did shows together he actually opened for me at one point
6848974 it was weird cause people didnt know him at all he was really well known in the music business because he was producing for everybody but no one kind of in the general public knew who he was as a rapper
6848975 we did a show at s o b s club and the crowd was definitely getting restless while he was performing its hard to play a live show when people have no idea who you are i knew he was going to be great and was going to be a big star but at the time no one knew little did they know who he was going to be
6848976 these weatherization assistance grants will save energy lower energy costs and increase the health and comfort of the homes of thousands of families
6848977 today the united states senate took an historic step to secure americas economic and energy future by sending comprehensive energy legislation to president bush for his signature
6848978 for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by the defendant of a law violation a stipulated final order requires approval by the court and has the force of law when signed by the judge
6848979 this case was brought as part of project fal e hope an ftc led effort that targeted bogus business opportunities and work at home scams and resulted in more than 100 law enforcement actions by the ftc the department of justice the u s postal inspection service and law enforcement agencies in 11 states
6848980 jill has been an effective advocate for president bush and for the department of energy in promoting commonsense policies that will help secure our energy future
6848981 as a valued member of my senior leadership staff jill led the departments congressional affairs team that helped secure passage of the energy bill her knowledge of energy issues expertise and commitment to public service make her a relied upon and valuable member of our team
6848982 we came here with the strong belief that russian troops must leave georgia as promised
6848983 their presence serves no good purpose represents an intimidating force and obstructs the delivery of humanitarian assistance as well as the rebuilding of what they have destroyed america cannot sit idly by in the face of such aggression and the effort to remove the democratically elected leader of a sovereign nation
6848984 as a result of tight oil and gas markets and the damage done by hurricanes katrina and rita its likely that consumers will see an increase in their heating bills this winter
6848985 our entire administration from the president on down is concerned about the impact of high home heating prices on american families this effort will provide consumers industry and federal agencies with a variety of energy saving ideas which if done properly can yield significant savings
6848986 coal is our most abundant source of energy and the university coal research program helps us identify new ways to utilize coal in a more efficient and environmentally responsible way by tapping into the creativity and ambition of americas young scientists
6848987 the ucr programs continue to build on the growing scope and tradition of the department of energys commitment to overall basic science and to the development of cleaner more efficient uses of fossil fuels
6848988 we are committed to doing everything in our power to meet the immediate needs of those directly affected by hurricane katrina by utilizing the resources from the strategic petroleum reserve we will help minimize any potential supply disruptions as a result of the hurricane with the reserve fully operational we will be able to start delivering this oil as soon as tomorrow
6848989 in addition we are continuing to review loan requests as they come in when a loan becomes finalized we will announce it
6848990 we are committed to doing everything in our power to meet the immediate needs of those directly affected by hurricane katrina by utilizing the resources from the strategic petroleum reserve we will help minimize any potential supply disruptions as a result of the hurricane with the reserve fully operational we will be able to start delivering this oil as soon as tomorrow
6848991 in addition we are continuing to review loan requests as they come in when a loan becomes finalized we will announce it
6848992 i am pleased that the national academy of sciences agrees that we are on the right path with our research and development we agree that this effort could lead to enormous benefits for the nation and the world i also am pleased that the report notes the promise of our governments partnership with the energy and automotive industries to develop advanced energy efficient passenger vehicles and the infrastructure to support them
6848993 david has been a key player in finding balanced legally sound solutions to some of the most complex and challenging problems faced by the department of energy
6848994 his knowledge experience and insight have made him an invaluable member of our team and he will play a key role in the implementation of the energy bill signed by president bush just two days ago
6848995 if youre like me and youve got one house or if you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6848996 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from a vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with help from a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6848997 let he who has not sinned cast the first stone
6848998 in this time of high energy costs and uncertain energy resources its important that the federal government help americans find ways to reduce home energy use and save money on their energy bills
6848999 under president bushs leadership we have developed new technologies and we continue to invest new dollars in finding ways to help homes become more energy efficient we want to pass along this knowledge to the american people as quickly as possible
6849000 for most owners and renters utility bills are the second largest household expense
6849001 thats why housing affordability and energy efficiency go hand in hand by reducing the price of utility bills we reduce the cost of living for the nations low and moderate income families
6849002 last year through the help of energy star americans chose to invest in cleaner air and healthier lives all the while saving enough energy to power 18 million homes and cutting 10 billion from their energy bills
6849003 we are delighted to work with our federal partners offering households energy efficiency solutions that lower energy bills avoid emissions from power plants and provide the next generation a healthier cleaner environment
6849004 the vision and framework is a comprehensive strategy that promotes the use of technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
6849005 it provides guidance and direction along with goals to federal agencies involved in climate change research and development by bringing together the varied expertise of agencies throughout the federal government and establishing a plan for the future the vision and framework will guide us for years to come
6849006 it has become increasingly clear that meeting the global challenge of climate change will require development and deployment of advanced technology in the energy field this vision and framework provides an overall strategy to guide and strengthen our technical efforts to reduce emissions
6849007 first of all on behalf of myself and the entire department of energy family i wish to extend our thoughts and prayers to those people affected by this terrible storm
6849008 two years ago american families and businesses throughout the northeast were plunged into darkness because of multiple factors leading to the failure of the power grid since that time weve made significant improvements but more work remains to be done
6849009 as we continue to improve our electricity grid the energy bill signed by president bush will greatly assist our efforts by increasing investment in infrastructure improving power generation and requiring a high standard of reliability
6849010 jim is a proven leader with a reputation for excellence and a record of getting the job done
6849011 in his prior position jim provided management direction for some of the department of energys largest most complex projects with the precision of an engineer and a keen business acumen jim will be a tremendous asset as head of our environmental management program
6849012 as it is one of the leading high tech centres in europe
6849013 well the lad has got two tremendous clubs to pick from if his dads right
6849014 we are looking for three more players to come in before the deadline but they have got to be the right players
6849015 we definitely need another defender there is no doubt about that
6849016 you guys are so hosed you didnt wave to jesus i waved to jesus and now im in with the man
6849017 gate centers of excellence are an exciting opportunity to equip a new generation of engineers and scientists with knowledge and skills in advanced automotive technologies
6849018 the technologies developed will benefit the industry as we work to create more efficient gas powered hybrid and even hydrogen powered vehicles
6849019 solid state lighting advances have the potential to greatly reduce energy consumption in u s buildings
6849020 this research supports the presidents commitment to increase energy efficiency and conservation key aspects of americas overall energy strategy
6849021 computer simulations on even the most powerful present day computers cannot handle these scientific problems so new mathematics is needed
6849022 this research has very practical applications and will help to solve some of our most complex energy and environmental problems
6849023 this report misunderstands the facts and the purpose of the strategic petroleum reserve
6849024 in 2002 the department of energy took delivery of approximately 40 million barrels of crude from the market for the strategic petroleum reserve
6849025 to put this into context the global market for crude oil in 2002 was approximately 28 billion barrels the amount used to increase the size of the reserve in 2002 is fourteen one hundredths 0 0014 percent of one percent of the global market
6849026 in response to the disruption of oil supplies from venezuela secretary abraham has deferred receipts of oil since december of 2002 totaling 18 5 million barrels requiring that those who owe oil to the reserve will now have to supply an additional 2 8 million barrels at a future date
6849027 president bushs directive to fill the reserve and secretary abrahams decision to defer that fill during the most acute period of the venezuela crisis have had only one result strengthening the energy security of the united states
6849028 the department of energys advanced fossil energy programs have shown significant progress in finding new ways to improve our methods of resource recovery from clean coal projects to natural gas turbines and drill pipe telemetry
6849029 but as we all know fossil energy is an international commodity and the more nations can share their advances and achievements with others the more we can enhance the worlds energy security
6849030 the los angeles fuel cell is the culmination of one of our most productive technology partnerships a joint development effort between the energy department and fuelcell energy that spans more than a quarter century
6849031 now because of this partnership the citizens of los angeles are seeing a preview of our energy future clean efficient power generated from hydrogen by innovative technology

6849241 i knew that prilukov could catch me because he did in the 400 freestyle
6849242 i won a match to get the bronze and youre losing a match to get the silver
6849243 i knew i wanted to go in with supreme confidence in my abilities and not doubting myself one second thats what i did and i wrestled the match of my life and it was awesome
6849244 it was a tough race we tried to ignore the fact that we havent had a medal yet as a country and just focus on our two kilometres
6849245 we are feeling the impacts of global economic factors beyond the control of any one individual or government
6849246 we are continuing to watch things closely of course because there is continuing weakness in the u s economy which has a slow growth effect on the canadian economy particularly on manufacturers exporters and the auto sector
6849247 we were slightly negative in the first quarter but only slightly negative so well see the numbers when they come out at the end of next week

6849375 the fed looks firmly on hold for many months caught between ongoing inflation concerns existing relatively low rates and the financial storm he talks about
6849376 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6849377 nevertheless the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain not least because of the difficulty of predicting the future course of commodity prices and we will continue to monitor inflation and inflation expectations closely the fed is committed to achieving medium term price stability and will act as necessary to attain that objective

6849393 chelsea have a great squad a great team and their offer is good for me and for the team
6849394 it isnt because of money it is simply because i want to leave my personal aim is to be the best player in the world and that isnt going to be possible at real madrid

6849405 since the in pipe technology implementation weve seen a 65 percent sludge reduction in less than six months
6849406 in pipe technology is doing real well for us were saving on electricity where we used to use two blowers we now only use one and weve been able to cut off air to the digestor were very pleased
6849407 historically marketing budgets are among the first to be cut in a budget crunch but marketers should be cautious about trying to find a quick fix
6849408 in fact spending more during tough times when competitors may be scaling back is a good way to strategically boost market share because this often helps brands come out ahead when the economy rebounds before rushing to slash marketing spending it is important to carefully evaluate how effective short term budget management can lead to significant long term benefits
6849409 effective marketing spending during economic downturns is not about how much you spend but how you spend it
6849410 marketers must assess how consumers and customer behavior can be positively influenced during tough times if it can then marketers should give increased consideration to more spending rather than cutting
6849411 he has a lot of hard work ahead of him he does show up though i think hes going to be a pretty good player 14 more mortgage scam victims sue jailed exeter broker and florida firm motorcycle riders traveling at high speed before crashing muhlenberg township police say
6849412 all of a sudden its what happened and why isnt he still playing or making a lot of plays
6849413 were in the preseason and this gives him an opportunity to learn the offense were not running the offense that we will probably run as the season continues on

6849416 anaerobic digestion is extremely attractive why would we go on throwing food waste into holes in the ground when we could generate our own electricity and end up with a product that can be returned to the soil it seems to me that a plant on this scale would fit into any industrial estate anywhere in the country while the decision has to be taken locally and in consultation with residents i am sure this is the way forward
6849417 we believe this compelling combination would create a strong platform for sustainable long term growth to better address the changing healthcare industry and provide meaningful cost effective medicines that improve the quality of life for patients
6849418 the transaction would create a diversified specialty pharmaceutical company with greater commercialization capabilities an expanded portfolio of pain management products and a strengthened pipeline which would include multiple platform technologies
6849419 our 33 00 per share all cash proposal provides alpharma stockholders with a substantial cash premium for their investment in the company we are confident that this combination would deliver significant benefits and superior value to our respective stockholders and employees and create a stronger platform to deliver innovation to patients prescribers and customers importantly it would also further diversify kings business with an additional source of steady cash flow from alpharmas animal health division a leading feed additives business in addition a combination with alpharma would deliver significant synergies
6849420 we believe our all cash proposal is too compelling to ignore in light of the fact that the alpharma board declined this proposal we think it is important for the stockholders of both companies to be aware of this exciting opportunity it remains our strong preference to work cooperatively with alpharma regarding this proposal
6849421 we have taken measures to address what can only be characterized as a challenging year thus far
6849422 after all is said and done the result of this plan is a leaner and more nimble ixi with a management team dedicated to building the ogo brand we hope that in the near future we will be able to report better operating results and an improved market position

6849459 competition is always welcome we have openings we have to fill them
6849460 whole industries are being globalized right now as we are speaking there is a lot of outsourcing there are a lot of companies going to china and india i think this would be great for students to learn and to prepare for global changes
6849461 those houses were nice and they were really cheap but they didnt explain the property taxes to us and they are too much

6849463 i was so happy to see that it was your listing because i knew it was going to show great and be priced right
6849464 what is your reputation among other agents and how will it benefit me if i choose you
6849465 oh i know this one will show well this agent always has the home staged well and priced right
6849466 weve worked with this buyers agent and this same lender that her buyers use before and they are both really good and run a clean deal on their side
6849467 the most important relationship you have in this business is your relationship with other agents dont let anyone tell you any different always be nice always be professional and cordial even when the other agent is a complete jerk it matters to your clients and it will determine your success

6849470 ok now what do we get when we add a negative number
6849471 so you never did tell me why you left me and married my best friend
6849472 i was just always wondering that and now that i know i feel better
6849473 its tough because everybody wants to play as much as they can but the fact that we have a
6849474 it tells me where i need to get to so one day i can fill their shoes if need be im trying to get to where they are now
6849475 weve got some guys in our receiving corps that are arguably the best in the acc and for me to be included in that in any way shape or form helps me tremendously hakeem and i go head to head a lot over the summer pushing each other to see who wants it more
6849476 just looking into some east coast schools i saw north carolina and decided to come for an official visit
6849477 i had heard so many good things about it and it was a situation where i thought i could come in and contribute and have a good home
6849478 im a little bit taller a little bit bigger frame so im able to get by smaller defensive backs the guys always say that i have deceptive speed because im so tall im not as quick as brandon or brooks but youve got to be careful and not let me get too much of a head start or ill be down the field before you know it
6849479 hes pushed all of the receivers to do the best that we can
6849480 he tells us every year that no spot is reserved and that weve got to earn it i definitely think the competition between the receivers that weve had has been good pushing everybody to their limits
6849481 coming into our second season under the same offensive coordinator everyones back and we know the offense and we know what we can do with the offense and talking about the running backs for instance it brings them along and tells them hey keep up because we have a veteran line and a veteran receiving corps its forcing every one to keep up with us
6849482 i just want to do what i can to help the team win
6849483 my job right now is to know everything and if hakeem needs a break one play or gets bang then i have to come in and do the same thing the same way so that the team doesnt miss a beat
6849484 he always said if the opportunity arises again i would love to try it again
6849485 but it wasnt like a dream he couldnt live without
6849486 he put the campaign on his back and climbed up a mountain alone
6849487 he appears to be something different than what he was
6849488 i dont think you get to be 70 years old and then fundamentally change
6849489 mccains gyrations have more to do with figuring out his own party than anything else hes had to sublimate for obvious reasons
6849490 theyre drinking the kool aid that somehow i have changed positions on the issues all i can say is that we all grow we all grow wiser and we all refine our positions
6849491 hes attracted like a moth to the flame to the hard things

6849663 who is a god like you who pardons iniquity and passes over the rebellious act of the remnant of his possession he does not retain his anger forever because he delights in unchanging love
6849664 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life
6849665 and hope does not disappoint because the love of god has been poured out within our hearts through the holy spirit who was given to us
6849666 but god demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us
6849667 for i am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord
6849668 but god being rich in mercy because of his great love with which he loved us even when we were dead in our transgressions made us alive together with christ by grace you have been saved

6849730 people who think that america is not in the game are totally wrong
6849731 but we have been importing like 17 percent of gdp gross domestic product if we have that gap and it continues the dollar over time will get weaker not necessarily next week or next month or next year but it will get weaker over time
6849732 i think it is going to be longer and deeper but no one knows when what you do know is that it will turn around
6849733 i mean the country will be doing far better five years from now than it is now but it wont be in my judgment it probably wont be doing better five months from now

6849753 this experience has led me to believe that one of the best ways to protect the financial system against future shocks including the possible failure of a major counterparty is by strengthening the financial infrastructure
6849754 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
6849755 we need to ensure that there are robust contingency plans for managing in an orderly manner the default of a major participant
6849756 a critical question for regulators and supervisors is what their appropriate field of vision should be
6849757 under our current system supervisors often focus on the financial conditions of individual institutions in isolation an alternative approach would broaden the mandate of regulators
6849758 the process is not always as nimble as we might like

6849798 therefore we are not in a position to comment any further
6849799 today our weekend got off to a good start but obviously it is far too early to say where we are compared to the opposition
6849800 the setup we have found today is not bad but there is still plenty of room for improvement
6849801 considering the dustiness of the track we made a very promising start on the setup this morning
6849802 we were able to go quicker on each run without changing too much and we took a very good baseline into the afternoon session

6849807 we lit up your world like the fourth of july
6849808 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
6849809 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
6849810 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat

6849832 kum ba ya not likely theyll find plenty of things to squabble over obama plans to deliver his acceptance speech in a stadium with 76 000 seats instead of the conventional hall heres one reason an audience of 74 000 obama fans will swamp 2 000 clinton delegates
6849833 today our weekend got off to a good start but obviously it is far too early to say where we are compared to the opposition
6849834 the setup we have found is not bad but there is still plenty of room for improvement
6849835 the first day was difficult for everybody especially to get the braking points its very hard on breaks
6849836 we keep improving the car race after race and we are in a position now to be in the top six in qualifiers and in the races to get points
6849837 considering the dustiness of the track we made a very promising start on the setup this morning
6849838 we were able to go quicker on each run without changing too much and we took a very good baseline into the afternoon session were in pretty good shape and im looking forward to tomorrow
6849839 to the extent that theyre nationalized theyre not going to default on their debt or derivative obligations
6849840 i think most parties would look at it as the u s government stepping in and guaranteeing the obligations of fannie and freddie
6849841 to that extent a counterparty to a derivatives contract with fannie and freddie would take great comfort in that
6849842 all i can say is its a very good deal
6849843 the last couple of weeks we put a lot of time in and we got it done
6849844 weve signed agreements with four businesses so far were having productive discussions with many more businesses and we expect other announcements soon
6849845 this fight will never be over so long as the city continues with its reckless plan to take our private land and give it to a politically connected developer

6849859 belgium is in danger of falling apart for more than six months the country has been unable to form a government that is able to unite the french speaking walloons 32 and dutch speaking flemish 58 the belgian monarch is desperately trying to stop his subjects from breaking up the state
6849860 w hy rely on london say the scots if brussels offers greater advantages
6849861 perhaps the citizens of belgium do not have enough in common anymore and the flemish and walloons would be better off divorced but one hopes not divorces are never painless and ethnic nationalism unleashes emotions that are undesirable we know what happened when the twin pulls of blood and soil determined european politics before without having intended it the eu now seems to be encouraging the very forces that postwar european unity was designed to contain
6849862 anachronism it has imported a characteristically late nineteenth century separatist project into a world that has moved on a world of individual rights open frontiers and international law
6849863 its gotten to the point that landlords want to rent only to flemish speakers
6849864 i used to hire flemish workers for building projects in francophone areas but now french workers need to speak dutch to be hired by flemish bosses at my bank documents are in flemish and if you ask for them in french youre told theyre out

6849992 the stakes are going to be high because of the situation going on with brett favre in new york city and us what we did last year so i think its going to be a very competitive atmosphere the fans will be here rooting for bragging rights for a year so were going to go out there and approach it like a regular season game and hopefully we are successful
6849993 it should be a little different i guess seeing him live in a dark green uniform
6849994 maybe media wise thats fine if the media want to cover them more and be in their locker room thats fine with us we have a lot of meetings to do anyways were not worried about flying under the radar we want to go out there and play good ball its still preseason and were working on a lot of stuff were trying to get guys healthy were trying to get guys to make this roster to see whos going to help us win this year

6849997 im not sure i would do that but we will see i dont close it completely we will extend them to the half and then we will see
6849998 every time out i expect them to play better to get better to become more cohesive and to have greater command of the game and the situations just improvement from the standpoint of team and our ability not only to defend but i want to see special teams improve i want our starters on special teams to improve i want that to be a good focus for us in both offensively and defensively i want to continue to grasp more of the elements of the game the situational concepts that go deeper into the nickel and the dime and the three wides
6849999 this is still out third preseason game and this is one game that brings us closer to a real game
