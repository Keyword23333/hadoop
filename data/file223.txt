2230012 a lot of citizens throughout the county still are not aware or dont understand that that my deputies cannot enforce federal law regarding immigration and illegal immigrants
2230013 we go ahead with our criminal charges place them in jail and then notify immigration and customs
2230014 we will continue to screen all inmates booked into the jail for legal status and any thats identified as being here illegally will be reported to immigration and customs enforcement
2230015 once that does materialize then my plans are hopefully being able to get some deputies trained to work with detention to make that a good working relationship
2230016 you know thats a few less criminals that we will have to worry about once these people are actually deported

2230019 while i know thats not how the big guy or gal if you prefer works thats how my week has been
2230020 we have talents and that we have to give them to the people that we love and love us back
2230021 thinking to give them to the whole world is too much and ambitious we have to think on how to give the best of us to the people that are close to us to try to make them living in a better place to make them happy for how much we can and in my opinion if we do our best for the people around us what we do is going to be even greater for the rest of the world but we are going to see the results on the people around us we can see their appreciation on their eyes and smiles

2230042 youll venture through space exploring new civilizations and life forms
2230043 youll also beam down to planets and have adventures inside your ship its a galactic wide game theres going to be tons of space to investigate we have a great system for exploration which will allow for almost infinite possibilities
2230044 as it became apparent they werent going to continue to function they decided to sell off the licence we swooped in and grabbed it we took no assets there was nothing to be had to be honest were building everything from the ground up
2230045 there might be a ship called enterprise flying around but its probably not the same ship anymore
2230046 most of the characters will have either retired or passed on but youll definitely be going to all the places you know and love from star trek expect to see oldies like vulcan and bajor but also fan favourites like andoria and qonos
2230047 youre going to see the actual game working and functioning
2230048 this isnt renders this isnt concept art everything that people will see on sunday is going to be taken right from star trek online as it stands today so hardened people should know that a release date might be closer than they think
2230049 i wanted me to feel that there was no hiding place it was a removal of layers rather than an adding of layers
2230050 between action and cut we were in a very protected private space in which we could be really vulnerable to each other
2230051 there were very gratifying moments when she would emerge from behind the camera in tears saying in a very quiet voice i dont want to do another take
2230052 he has dodged mortality by having all these affairs but for him to really commit is to commit to death
2230053 and in a sense quite beautifully i suppose its true when you truly see somebody with whom you are overjoyed at spending the rest of your life with whom you can see a great journey the end of that journey is death
2230054 so in a sense youre looking at your own mortality
2230055 i did a film called sexy beast and i do know that that is my anger in the film you cant invent this i know that in schindlers list thats my revulsion an incomprehension that this could be happening to human beings i know that in house of sand and fog that is my perception of how a man should look after his family
2230056 the buck does have to stop here sooner or later
2230057 if i were really fortunate then i would be born into some mythology

2230059 i worry about cgi when it tries to replace the actors human experience
2230060 if i was to play napoleon and they said dont worry were going to cgi your army behind you id say no you wont
2230061 im rather fascinated by how greatness lets go how men let go kepesh lets go of the whole architectured existence and he demolishes it
2230062 the journey is what attracts me how a man changes
2230063 seriously folks dont burn your copies of the book return them
2230064 i think meyers fans would send a much more powerful message if instead of a book burning tour they staged a book returning tour
2230065 not only is this girl seriously melodramatic and clumsy shes the most weak willed and pathetic character ever written
2230066 she has said numerous times that she would simply die if edward ever left her its like her entire life revolves around him what are you trying to tell young women ms meyer dont girls have enough self esteem problems already should they really be reading books about a girl who has no life outside of her boyfriend a girl who readily admits that she would die if he were to ever leave her
2230067 i think most readers would have settled for maybe a surprise pregnancy at the end or something to that effect if meyer really wanted a baby in this story but the fact that it swallowed the whole plot just plain sucks
2230068 i was extremely disappointed with the fourth book i want my money back
2230069 this creepy anti abortion allegory quickly gets literal as the half vampire fetus starts killing bella from the inside out even as it breaks her ribs and sucked the life from her she proclaims i wont kill him but does she have to face the consequences of this choice no because vampire magic suddenly allows mother and father to hear the fetuss thoughts and to discover that it already loves them
2230070 he had a soul that is often missing in the business which has taken on much more of a corporate tone
2230071 where did i go right youre no one in hollywood unless someone wants you dead
2230072 we got a dead person a 250 a week raise i knew i was in the right business
2230073 you take care of everything and get them ready for the day
2230074 how do you take an actor or comedian or a writer and point them in the right direction and go through all that garbage unless you love it and love them and think theyre talented and worth it
2230075 i put about 20 films in development at lorimar and ended up making six lousy movies two good movies and one great movie
2230076 she has decided that she will need a few more weeks than originally planned to be ready for her return to the stage
2230077 president bush is paving the way for the chinese authorities to further clamp down on religious freedom instead of fostering it as he claims

2230101 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2230102 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2230103 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2230104 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
2230105 voor sommige winkeliers zal dit wellicht de doodsteek zijn het was al moeilijk het hoofd boven water te houden omdat het centrum met leegstand kampt we moesten het zien uit te houden tot de nieuwbouw over een paar jaar gereed zou zijn voor sommigen wordt dat nu een bijna onmogelijke opgave het is nu vooral hopen dat de gemeente en frm veel haast maken

2230110 you have no idea how hard it was to not make a joke about taking away old peoples licenses
2230111 these grants are an important step in helping young texans and protecting our communities
2230112 by funding these services the state helps texas adolescents who engage in self destructive and criminal activities find their way back on the road to becoming productive
2230113 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2230114 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2230115 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

2230117 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2230118 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2230119 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2230120 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2230121 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2230122 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2230123 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2230124 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2230125 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2230126 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2230127 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2230128 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2230129 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2230130 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2230131 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2230132 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2230133 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2230134 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2230135 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2230136 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2230137 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2230138 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2230139 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2230140 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

2230159 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2230160 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2230161 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2230162 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2230163 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2230164 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

2230167 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2230168 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2230169 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2230170 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2230171 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2230172 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2230173 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2230174 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2230175 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2230176 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2230177 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2230178 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2230179 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2230180 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2230181 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2230182 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2230183 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2230184 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

2230195 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula

2230218 this is very useful information from fdf it will help the waste industry and local planners to understand where its worthwhile to provide facilities like anaerobic digestion which is the key technology for material such as food waste i chaired a meeting only this week with around fifty senior industry and ngo executives who have pledged to work with government on ways to increase the use of anaerobic digestion solid facts and figures like these will be a vital way of taking that aim forward
2230219 the results of this survey demonstrate the level of ongoing commitment by fdf members to making a significant contribution to improving the environment by targeting areas where they can make the biggest difference our members initiatives are preventing significant amounts of waste at their sites and it is fantastic that the vast majority of waste that does arise is already treated in an environmentally friendly way we hope that the survey results will send a message to the waste industry to invest more in anaerobic digestion and composting capacity in line with fdfs ambition to send zero food and packaging waste to landfill from 2015
2230220 wrap welcomes fdf establishing a base line on food waste for its members the industry is already taking steps to recycle and recover waste this work also shows the potential for further treatment of food waste using technology such as anaerobic digestion wrap will continue to work with fdf members on further waste minimisation activities and on expanding the food waste processing infrastructure through its capital grants scheme

2230373 consumers and small business owners remain concerned about the economy inflation and most of all higher gas prices
2230374 it is difficult to forecast the benefit from the economic stimulus through the rest of the year
2230375 with the end of the stimulus cheques we know consumers are spending more cautiously and we expect to see a pronounced pay cheque cycle at the end of the month
2230376 once the stimulus is gone the worry is were back in this tough economic environment
2230377 but we were never really out of the tough environment maybe the market got complacent it still has some merits as an investment last year it was a great valuation and contrarian story the easy money has been made but its not too late to get in while the goings good

2230403 the construction of settlements anywhere in the occupied palestinian territories including east jerusalem is illegal under international law
2230404 this decision serves to undermine the credibility of the ongoing peace process

2230491 what is totally lacking is a determined will to act against the settlers in terms of arrest and prosecution
2230492 the israelis just called now to say they have an operation and i must take my men off the streets
2230493 its like working in a mine field despite that we still cooperate with the israelis
2230494 so far there is no approval from the israeli side but yes the plan is to bring them to hebron
2230495 allowing them weapons with a possible withdrawal of israeli forces from that side of the city is a recipe for disaster
2230496 israel has to understand that our security has to be in israeli hands they cannot put the security of israelis living in hebron or anywhere else into the hands of our enemies
2230497 people say you ran the campaign in nablus and the israelis finished it
2230498 if the aim is law enforcement we are with it 100 percent but if it is to eliminate the resistance or factions opposed to the palestinian authority we are against it
2230499 the clans are stronger than the police who hide in their bases whenever the israelis enter hebron this doesnt provide security for anyone

2230502 the fact that the activities i had yesterday and the way the knee responded today honestly i do feel positive in the sense that were progressing forward
2230503 this agreement is tremendously significant at a time when the political authorities in israel and palestine and the international community are failing to find just and lasting solutions to the political impasse it means that the pgftu will be able to ensure much more effective representation for palestinian workers while those working for israeli employers will also benefit
2230504 the agreement calls upon the ituc and its affiliates to continue to support future cooperation and we are fully committed to do this
2230505 this removes a key obstacle to future cooperation and the full respect of the rights of palestinian workers decent work is a foundation stone for political and economic justice and we will now be in a position to devote even more attention to tackling the appalling state of the palestinian economy and playing a fuller part in the quest for justice fairness and democratic rights in the building of a palestinian state
2230506 we are very pleased that this agreement has now been reached
2230507 every worker whether of israeli palestinian or other origin must have full rights to the protections offered by international labour standards the outcome of our dialogue with the pgftu can only help achieve this and help lay the foundations for future cooperation between israeli and palestinian trade unions and progress in our shared quest for justice peace and prosperity for all in the region
2230508 i will support deputy prime minister and foreign minister tzipi livni in her candidacy to lead kadima and the next government

2230543 its not a very well lit road so i think it mightve been an accident

2230585 one of the downsides is when you go to put out a house fire you see the loss that occurs
2230586 this is outweighed by the satisfaction of helping the victims at the time it is a challenge though our service does debrief after any major incident particularly in nasty incidents the service provides counsellors to get through the traumatic side of the job
2230587 the role of the fire brigade like every essential service has a place it is most important in my opinion to be maintained at the level that it is now
2230588 whenever there is a pumper or tanker out of town theres always another here the town is always protected
2230589 when all is said and done it is a voluntary thing that is done for the community
2230590 we took three young yearlings out to texas as part of an educating process for this weeks brisbane ekka where the same three animals will be exhibited

2230597 its not an emergency service but for people with ongoing medical requirements and its not just for kids either but any cause they consider worthy you do have to be nominated by a medical person or government agency
2230598 health service facilities within the tablelands cluster were the first in hunter new england health to receive the maximum four years accreditation with no high priority recommendations
2230599 i am very proud of this remarkable achievement it takes huge commitment and cooperation to achieve this sort of result
2230600 it demonstrates the commitment of all staff to strive toward the common goals of the health service as well as a commitment to provide the highest possible standard of care to their local communities
2230601 meeting with staff and seeing facilities is important for members of the area executive team it helps to create a more unified area health service where each staff member feels part of wider organisation
2230602 few things irk me more than shoddy journalism lousy research and bad intentions and these three neatly came together in a piece by nicholas carlson published today in valleywag
2230603 most likely explanation is that he knows he might do business with draper fisher jurvetson again and he doesnt want to be blackballed

2230617 jon fitch is a great opponent a tough opponent but st pierre brings the whole backing of canada with him to a fight fan base this sport its entertainment it would be great to put on a big fight with me and st pierre but then again its about me fighting the best fighter and if fitch goes down and proves hes the best fighter then hes the man im moving up to the welterweight division and moving down to defend the lightweight title
2230618 they said we like the company and we like the people involved but our intention was not to turn up and underwrite debenture holders we wanted to help fund the long term future of the business not to replace investors capital
2230619 if i do my best here there are not too many in the world that can keep up
2230620 we are the best prepared team and weve got the environment in place to do it
2230621 if you look at the amount of people we have in the worlds top three and potentially in finals its exciting and once youre in a final at the olympic games you can pull off some of the outside medals
2230622 if we also win the ones we are supposed to win then i honestly believe it will be a very successful games
2230623 weve got 17 athletes in the top 10 in the world who have all performed extremely well in the past six to 12 months
2230624 but to predict how many of those would end up winning a medal would be the kiss of death but i think there is a general expectation within the team that we are expecting to do extremely well
2230625 its spooky the potential weve got its looking very good but the thing weve learned in sport dont celebrate until its over
2230626 all the crews are going pretty well in training but its an olympics anything can happen
2230627 potentially you come out with eight medals but because it is the olympic games people lift performances so we need to lift more than the rest of the world

2230638 i am still very keen to hear from anyone who may be able to assist me in identifying who may be responsible for leaving the baby in the nurses home all those years ago
2230639 i cannot exclude the possibility that the baby was left by a traumatised mother who simply could not cope and who intended the child to be discovered
2230640 i would appeal directly to the mother of the baby to contact me so that this matter can be resolved and so that the baby can have an identity
2230641 i would far rather the mother come forward voluntarily than be identified by dna technology further down the line
2230642 i will personally guarantee that any information will be treated in the strictest confidence

2230648 senator obama offers much larger tax breaks to low and middle income taxpayers and would increase taxes on high income taxpayers
2230649 but his plan is to raise your taxes and spend more of your money its not my idea of a solution to what troubles washington in fact it sounds a lot like the problem

2230651 and thats the problem in our nations capital its not just the bush administration and its not just the democratic congress its that everyone in washington says whatever it takes to get elected or to score the political point of the day

2230655 for israel this is not a target that cannot be achieved
2230656 actually increasing the nationalist fervor to build a nuclear weapon
2230657 a two three year delay is not worth it for a five to 10 year delay i would say yes

2230737 things we know without really knowing how we know it or how we learned it we poke at a fire for 20 minutes and cant say what we learned exactly only that the time was well spent

2230847 and these properties cost on average 1 000 per square foot so a 3 000 square foot home sells for around 3 million as a result luxury residence club homes which sell at a fraction of the cost are becoming increasingly popular they are being bought by people who want to enjoy a dream vacation home in bermuda but dont want the multi million dollar price tag
2230848 it is best for buyers to purchase their residences during the earliest phase as there is typically a 30 percent price increase between the first and final phases

2230862 black americans can do anything look you got obama to the presidency any complaining is just whining

2230875 we dont sit around worrying about the economy because we cant afford to
2230876 we work right through a bad economy the expression is we keep reloading the wagon here we dont worry about the mule going blind and we dont worry about what the competition is doing
2230877 as a large company we can afford to make our own mortgages smaller developers would be more stressed over this issue you put up a hotel and it has recurring revenues you build a timeshare and sell out and there are no more revenues outside perhaps the maintenance fees people pay in the timeshare industry companies have to keep building or their revenues go flat
2230878 we werent part of the overheating of the real estate market or the subprime crisis
2230879 we have our own sales and marketing forces and we are fishing every day for customers hotels dont know what to do when the phone stops ringing timeshare developers know how to keep prospects showing up for their sales presentations in good times and bad
2230880 in the second quarter institutional seems to have had inflows of around 600 million a significant about turn from previous quarters the higher margin retail though has seen second quarter outflows of about 700 million not surprising given the difficult industry backdrop but nevertheless not what people would have wanted to see
2230881 profits are comfortably ahead of our expectations and in the right places with outperformance in asset management
2230882 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off at the moment no apps have been blacklisted but by all appearances this has been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for if apple so chooses to shut them down i discovered this doing a forensic examination of an iphone 3g it appears to be tucked away in a configuration file deep inside corelocation
2230883 in light of the complexity of the case the potential exposure to the state as well as other pending litigation involving touchplay it was decided to attempt to settle the matter

2230885 its a work of art with no hidden function at all
2230886 i have no idea why they did it and am not aware of any violation of the rules to sell software on the app store
2230887 and clicking on the gem will take you to a site that will show you what youre really buying for 999
2230888 i wanted me to feel that there was no hiding place it was a removal of layers rather than an adding of layers
2230889 between action and cut we were in a very protected private space in which we could be really vulnerable to each other
2230890 there were very gratifying moments when she would emerge from behind the camera in tears saying in a very quiet voice i dont want to do another take
2230891 he has dodged mortality by having all these affairs but for him to really commit is to commit to death
2230892 and in a sense quite beautifully i suppose its true when you truly see somebody with whom you are overjoyed at spending the rest of your life with whom you can see a great journey the end of that journey is death
2230893 so in a sense youre looking at your own mortality
2230894 i did a film called sexy beast and i do know that that is my anger in the film you cant invent this i know that in schindlers list thats my revulsion an incomprehension that this could be happening to human beings i know that in house of sand and fog that is my perception of how a man should look after his family
2230895 the buck does have to stop here sooner or later
2230896 if i were really fortunate then i would be born into some mythology
2230897 but we can enter into shakespeares world and by his miracle and the language through him we can be back in ancient britain
2230898 i worry about cgi when it tries to replace the actors human experience
2230899 if i was to play napoleon and they said dont worry were going to cgi your army behind you id say no you wont
2230900 im rather fascinated by how greatness lets go how men let go kepesh lets go of the whole architectured existence and he demolishes it

2230906 cannot be afraid of openly discussing the needs of religious communities
2230907 we were also aware of the subjective nature of how some supervisors have interpreted the countys comprehensive plan
2230908 we understood we were taking a risk but it was calculated
2230909 it is a lovely area and we are upset about this
2230910 can you believe two occurrences in days this is illegal and its damaging for a very precious resource we have wed like to get to the bottom of it and find the culprits this is outrageous
2230911 you would think it would be done under the cover of darkness but its a secluded community so it wouldnt have to be
2230912 id like to have a baby on sept 9 2009
2230913 you sometimes get your blinders on and you say aha
2230914 we take the possibility of any adulterated product very seriously
2230915 the e coli must be present to begin with but if the meat is temperature abused the number of e coli that are present can multiply
2230916 if you look around you see that there are very very few restaurants that score 100
2230917 if we had 10 or more violations in a single visit that would be a flag
2230918 all of the things they found in this years inspection were handled immediately they issued the permits for us to operate right after they did their inspections and these things are clearly not connected to the e coli issue
2230919 the police did it they did a great job virginia beach is a super safe place to be and i look forward to going back next year
2230920 he says it looks like that guys carrying my surfboard
2230921 he keeps telling me some story then he says i think that is my surfboard
2230922 being an idiot i said sir sir excuse me is that yours
2230923 this did not stop them and in fact they sped up morrogh took off after them
2230924 the massive windowless walls with no windows or doors on the street and a door only visible from one of the four directions approaching the church is not us
2230925 prohibits zoning and landmarking laws that substantially burden the religious exercise of churches or other religious assemblies
2230926 its a question of whether the building is more important than the people worshiping inside
2230927 many people dont understand that a church is not just a house of worship
2230928 we need the resources for activity and ministry work during the week
2230929 its our mission to put ourselves in the position where we can help those who are in need we have to be the best possible stewards of the money that people donate to the army
2230930 we gave ourselves timelines and projections and we even said by march 31 2009 if it is not making their targeted financial goals that the center should close as of aug 1 2009
2230931 we would not want to operate the center if it was fully subscribed with kids of families with some means

2230934 i didnt think the captaincy affected me because before the game i still did the right things and the right amount of work i normally do
2230935 in terms of me and how ive been playing i have been getting hundreds and scoring runs
2230936 there was a lot of scrutiny that went with this match but i was so happy when i flipped the coin yesterday
2230937 i just went out and expressed myself today knowing i needed to score some runs and we needed to get a lead
2230938 i dont like to make mountains out of molehills i just like to be as simple as i can
2230939 i built an innings played straight played in my areas played a few shots which were funky i suppose but just got on with it
2230940 in terms of my relationship with the players i have to keep growing that
2230941 that has come on leaps and bounds in the four days i have been in charge
2230942 i am getting to learn a lot more about how the guys operate and you have a really different perspective
2230943 you really want them to do well for them for you the team its really a holistic thing
2230944 i wasnt happy with myself for getting out then but im very happy with the situation the team is in and how we performed
2230945 my first two days have been great ive just tried to go out and play my normal game
2230946 we may as well just throw all these letters up into the wind
2230947 i dont think theres any doubt in anyones mind that we have a moral and statutory duty to notify people that evidence exists that could prove their innocence
2230948 by choosing to use the mail we are selecting the least reliable method of notification
2230949 i think it will work in many many of the cases in those cases where it doesnt work then we can explore another option
2230950 its the key swing area in the state said phil cox a consultant for republicans in virginia
2230951 im so glad to be here in norfolk she said at old dominion
2230952 i knew it was big i knew hundreds of thousands of military personnel and family lived and worked here but i wasnt prepared for just how big it is
2230953 from a public health standpoint thats not going to help the consumer or the doctor to treat their illness
2230954 acting with an abundance of caution we are recalling the product from distribution channels until we can determine whether illnesses in virginia are connected to our operations or have some other original source or cause we wish to express our sympathy to those taken ill and we are working diligently to correct the situation
2230955 there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death
2230956 schnurlos reicht es nicht dass unser internet und telefon kaputt ist
2230957 dagenhams not the easiest game in the world ive been to watch them and the play quite direct
2230958 theyve got a big team and the ball is in the air an awful lot and it suits them there is nothing wrong with that as it suits the players theyve got
2230959 but id prefer to play against a footballing team and match up really like the way we want to play
2230960 its the story behind the story of that magical era
2230961 the channel says the moms relax with their hands behind their heads
2230962 its a bit like having a football league with no footballs
2230963 if it did get a lot worse and we started to see a lot of trees dying it would certainly change the face of parks and gardens
2230964 we hope that it will help us with fighting crime in the community
2230965 the more the community knows about these crimes the safer it will become
2230966 what we were finding was that people were interested in what was happening in their neighborhood
2230967 they also care about the little burglary the larcenies the bikes stolen on their street
2230968 its close to home and we hope to have enough that everyone will want to come check us out
2230969 a lot of volunteers and people worked together and it just grew now it has something for everyone its like a carnival
2230970 us older people want the fair to be educational too more than just entertainment
2230971 its amazing to watch people come through and see their reactions some have no idea what a cow or pig looks like up close
2230972 this is the first year we had tried an act this large
2230973 it is creating quite a buzz so we are looking forward to it
2230974 when im lying in the arms of the woman i love im completely at piece with the world and the dark clouds around me that often surround me you just fall away into the dark im not scared anymore
2230975 and i cant sleep at night and i just stare at the moon listening to your beating heart to know that youre with me and the love that you give keeps me from falling apart im not scared anymore
2230976 cynical dog i know you are in my imagination my heart i know you are a symbol of my lost faith and a metaphor for the dog i had as child which we will meet in a flashback sequence later in the book
2230977 i believe is the best contractor in the world for this subject matter
2230978 we need to enhance our training and get it back on track
2230979 this will give us the ability to do so and train 24 hours a day seven days a week
2230980 racial classification is now seen to be of virtually no genetic or taxonomic significance
2230981 the largest part by far of human variation is accounted for by the differences between individuals
2230982 businesses are increasingly looking at more environmentally friendly ways to operate and insurers want to play a role in that
2230983 competitive pressures are forcing insurers to offer more and more of these options
2230984 even if they have to pay a little bit more i dont think youll see argument or concern because theyre going to pass those costs on to their tenants anyway
2230985 i think youre going to see this more and more
2230986 apparently as more and more homes are passing into foreclosure and there are many and many of those homes have backdoor pools these are being neglected
2230987 theyre not being maintained and this can become a ripe feeding ground and breeding ground for these mosquito populations
2230988 could you be more of a fully bipedal over craniumed wanker
2230989 with a modicum of talent ruthless efficiency and some element of surprise jbm should be in a position to destroy the competition and own the juggernaut business mechanical sector

2230992 as we express our gratitude we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words but to live by them
2230993 it is outrageous that the federal government continues to require and even to subsidize the diversion of corn from the food supply into the fuel supply

2230997 by leslie alsheimer i know its a big old mouthful but its a great book and whilst its not complete rocket science front to back for example anyone thats been using photoshop in anger for a couple of versions should have at least some of this down already i can almost guarantee that there is useful content in here for even the most seasoned professionals and for the rest of us mere mortals theres a stack of useful information that goes way beyond the basics

2230999 all the residents have now moved out of southfield care homes and we have worked to place them in the best alternative accommodation
2231000 we have worked together throughout the process to address the health and care needs of all the residents at the home in both the immediate and long term
2231001 we have assessed the needs of each resident and plans for their care and health needs have been made and are being implemented
2231002 we can confirm the death of two terminally ill residents who had been receiving nursing home care at southfield care homes
2231003 during safeguarding investigations such as this it is common place and routine for post mortems to be carried out to establish the cause of death this has already taken place
2231004 weve made a list and we are going house to house
2231005 why do i need a dvr expander when ive got an unused external pc hard drive couldnt i just plug it into the dvrs usb port
2231006 they were so excited theyre rvers so they can go anywhere on the road find a computer go into the download a book and play it while they drive down the highway
2231007 we also know we are touching only a small percentage of each librarys patrons
2231008 its a like this nice secret that we of course dont want to be kept secret
2231009 material that doesnt take up shelf space and is available 24 7 thats really attractive for libraries
2231010 find a place where you can find peers and encouragement the impressionists show the typical pattern they were born all over france pissarro was born in the carribbean and died all over france but what defined them were the years they spent together in paris
2231011 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off
2231012 at the moment no apps have been blacklisted but by all appearances this had been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for if apple so chooses to shut them down
2231013 every wanna be watergate journalist in the northern hemisphere e mails me with conspiracy theories
2231014 its like saying once you get into willy wonkas chocolate factory and youre in the garden where everythings edible you have it all
2231015 the program has been under wraps for six months but with the attention to mobile device security new mobile devices and considering how companies are trying to save money on energy lately we felt it was time to announce the initiative
2231016 companies need to ask will it be productive does it really add value to our bottom line
2231017 we believe the relevance of this decision may be lost if notification is delivered to prospective and existing customers too far in advance of cmas commercial availability
2231018 we expect redesigned macbooks and macbook pros and a new ipod touch
2231019 piper jaffray believes apple will increase the capacity of the ipod shuffles as well as the ipod nanos but maintain current price points redesigned form factors for the shuffles and nanos are unlikely
2231020 while there has been some speculation that apple will introduce a portable mac based on the multitouch technology in the iphone and ipod touch we do not believe apple will release such a device in september
2231021 because someone uploaded it theres no moderation theres no way to guarantee it wont turn bad
2231022 from the piano black finish to its built in touchdisc touchpad
2231023 can make it a pleasure for you to type control music or launch your favorite applications
2231024 energy savings were not exactly a hot topic among customers last year
2231025 but this year nine out of ten people ask point blank whether a product will help them save money
2231026 going green is not only eco friendly but crucial for business
2231027 this goes beyond just products extending throughout the development and manufacturing process
2231028 my electricity bill more than doubles in the summer as we turn on the air conditioner
2231029 i also have to do lots of laundry for the kids the bill now easily tops 170 000 won 162 a month
2231030 we will gradually shift to front loaders and the steam technology will become more mainstream
2231031 led saves up to 40 percent of the power used in traditional backlights
2231032 next year they will be commonly found in notebook screens and will be increasingly used in tv panels from 2010
2231033 you could buy another 32 inch lcd tv within 3 years with the money saved on electricity from our 52 inch power saving tv
2231034 thats a little nudge to help people buy products that are more efficient even if they are slightly more expensive
2231035 more than 25 million u s adults fall into this segment enough for even the largest consumer electronics marketers to target
2231036 green targeted pcs and other electronics will evolve as part of the consumer electronics industrys move to go beyond beige box design
2231037 to be with these other athletes who are on the cover with me now i can cheer and watch them at the beard the youngest u s swimmer to ever bring home the gold after her performance at the 1996 games in atlanta was also playing nintendo olympics game with the power pad where you started out as the turtle and worked your way up to the cheetah
2231038 my family would have competitions against other families who were close friends and wed rock it wed do the triple jump and the hurdles and all of that fun stuff
2231039 like every guy its a major part of my life especially when you travel overseas
2231040 video games pass the time so much easier than just playing cards
2231041 all the guys i know bring a ps2 psp and a controller with them to the international competitions they get into some pretty heated madden tournaments
2231042 olympic track athletes spend a lot of free time trying to be the best in their favorite video games so much so our fingers sometimes get more tired then our legs do in actual races
2231043 for me it keeps me off my feet it keeps me engaged and i dont waste a lot of energy playing them
2231044 maybe some young kid will play the game and be inspired to go out and train in real life with the goal of really being in the some day
2231045 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
2231046 by using biologically inspired imaging modes in which the electronic eye rotates through small angles and the computer synthesizes a sequence of images we achieve much higher levels of effective resolution
2231047 the small number of pixels is limited only by our university clean room fabrication facilities theoretical analysis by our collaborators at northwestern confirm the compatibility of the basic approaches with much higher numbers of detector pixels
2231048 hemispherical detector arrays are also much better suited for use as retinal implants than flat detectors
2231049 the ability to wrap high quality silicon devices onto complex surfaces and biological tissues adds very interesting and powerful capabilities to electronic and optoelectronic device design
2231050 in our present fabrication sequence the thin elastomer drumhead is used only as an element to accomplish the planar to hemispherical geometry transformation
2231051 rather than launch mobileme as a monolithic service we could have launched over the air syncing with iphone to begin with followed by the web applications one by one mail first followed 30 days later if things went well with mail by calendar then 30 days later by contacts
2231052 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
2231053 more to learn about internet services and learn we will the vision of mobileme is both exciting and ambitious and we will press on to make it a service we are all proud of by the end of this year
2231054 it was a miscalculation without exception technology companies have botched launches
2231055 why were they able to get itunes right but not this were they just stretched too thin
2231056 maybe they were a little bit too cocky about this it made logical sense to launch mobileme at the same time as the iphone
2231057 the application really does nothing its about teaching you in theory how to become rich through a mantra of some sort it really was a functionless useless application that served no one other than the developer unsuspecting people bought it for 1 000 maybe hoping to get something in return
2231058 apple has said from day one that it was going to in some sense police the app store in terms of questionable content that might be violating other peoples content and trademarks and services
2231059 in this case this was an application that was designed to make the application developer rich
2231060 its apples store like any merchant they have the right to decide what products they are going to put on their shelves particularly products that may be harmful or offensive to customers or that may be violating piracy or trademark laws
2231061 it attempts to strike that balance to provide full credit for the ideal students who graduate with a diploma
2231062 but it also offers recognition although lesser credit for successful efforts to keep children in school like a ged because if students are not in school they cant learn
2231063 we have to be careful that we dont create unintended consequences by putting a lot of weight to last resort options
2231064 remains unknown although estimates range from several hundred to several thousand
2231065 i had a couple of chances in the carling cup and fa cup and played a couple of league games
2231066 there are a few blue square premier clubs who have shown an interest
2231067 i cant ask to be in any better shape than were in we are more than ready i think stalybridge is a great fixture for us
2231068 its anyones call who can win that game if we can get three points there it sets us up nicely
2231069 i do expect blues to be around there it depends who comes in i saw blues play a lot last season and i only saw them get beat once
2231070 but they did look well short on quality and they need some more
2231071 maybe the kid cameron jerome might have a good season this year the champioship might suit him
2231072 he did very well when he was at cardiff in that division he might be worth persevering with in there
2231073 we will review the sport post games as a matter of course and not about just one individual
2231074 i felt if i pushed it any further there would have been a serious health risk
2231075 it was the hardest decision i have ever had to make in boxing
2231076 its simply criminal that hes not going to the olympics
2231077 i can only guess that some real errors have been made and that frankie has been let down
2231078 what happened has cost frankie gavin a million pounds thats how much they were saying an olympic gold medal would have been worth to him if he turned pro straight after the games and its just been ruined now
2231079 i guarantee that i would have got frankie gavin to make the weight
2231080 im the guy who starts working with ricky hatton when he rolls into the gym weighing 185 pounds and i get him to shift 45 pounds in time to make the weight every time before every fight
2231081 im really pleased to be here at villa its happened quite quickly
2231082 i think at the minute villa are a notch above boro and theres a great opportunity for me to play european football as well
2231083 the right back position caused us a few problems for us last season in terms of us not having a natural right back
2231084 luke is a natural right back and played for england not so long ago he did very well for boro last season and this is a great opportunity for him
2231085 i can achieve all my ambitions at this football club
2231086 obviously i talked to the manager and hes very positive and ambitious thats what i am i want to get back into the premier league and show people what i can do
2231087 nicky is a quality natural left back who played for england 18 months ago
2231088 obviously the injury to freddie bouma has left a gaping hole on the left freddie had a wonderful season for us last year and this wasnt necessarily a priority for us before the injury
2231089 but nicky shorey is more than a back up hes a quality player on the ball and is up for the challenge
2231090 a cuba no hi ha viol ncia de g nere
2231091 the initial announcement from the football league was negative and took us by surprise a little but the latest news came as a great relief really i suppose
2231092 this announcement has put us where we want to be and now we can move forward and take this club to the next level
2231093 prepared to exercise its absolute discretion under the exceptional circumstances provisions of its insolvency policy
2231094 we are looking at the appeal process but we are not entirely comfortable with that at the moment so we are negotiating
2231095 ultimately our members will decide if they want to take industrial action to try to correct some of the wrongs
2231096 we as an employer are obliged to review all of our staffs pay in relation to one another and we have to implement that with due consideration to equal pay for work of equal value
2231097 that has meant that some staff have gone up and some staff unfortunately have gone down
2231098 these are good staff that provide a very very good service to the people of bury and they have been very loyal to this council and the locality and my heart does go out to them
2231099 its been a long journey over the last two years
2231100 from what his mother told me he went hiking on a particular route
2231101 hes been hiking before there was no evidence of stress or strange behaviour there was no family row
2231102 i think his whole life is teaching he does extra curricular work outside school hours for the school and spends his time at hyde united or watching sport
2231103 i dont want to speculate but i know of no reason why he would disappear so you are fearful theres been an accident
2231104 if thats the case you would have a rough idea where hes been walking it shouldnt be that difficult to find him but they havent
2231105 we are celebrating his life and it is a chance for the girls to tell everyone just how much they thought of him
2231106 for me the procession will be a comfort its going to be a very emotional day but it wont be sombre
2231107 garrys life was taken so needlessly and you never get over that
2231108 time is not a healer ill never heal i cant plan for the future at all
2231109 theres nothing to look forward to personally i live from one day to the next
2231110 my life is very lonely a jigsaw piece is missing
2231111 when the first of august came last week it was a huge reality check i have been on automatic pilot
2231112 the overwhelming majority of passengers make sure that they have bought a ticket before getting on a tram
2231113 this campaign will target those people who think they can get away with using the trams for free
2231114 ustedes nos pueden ayudar much simo como lo hacen y lo han hecho hay que tomar todas las iniciativas que puedan
2231115 tenemos toda la disposici n de lograr por supuesto la mejor relaci n con la cruz roja a quien agradecemos todo lo que han hecho en colombia y tenemos todo el inter s de seguir teniendo una relaci n eficaz eficiente amplia y generosa
2231116 colombia est pasando por un buen momento hemos tenido avances muy significativos en nuestra pol tica interna
2231117 la comunidad internacional nos est viendo con m s confianza con m s respeto si no fuera as no estar amos teniendo los ndices de crecimiento en inversi n extranjera que tenemos
2231118 colombia es vista hoy como un lugar en el que hay que estar y hay que invertir
2231119 han hecho que a colombia la miren distinto con m s respeto con m s confianza
2231120 claro que tenemos niveles de pobreza enormes problemas de seguridad serios y preocupaci n por el narcotr fico
2231121 no queremos eludir los problemas pero queremos que se nos reconozca por los avances la fortaleza institucional el sacrificio nuestro capital humano y sobre todo por el potencial y las oportunidades que ofrecemos
2231122 he has preyed upon a vulnerable elderly woman and tricked his way into her house stooping so low as to steal her handbag and leaving this woman absolutely traumatised
2231123 no one should be made to feel like that in their own home
2231124 i would ask that local residents be extra vigilant when answering the door to strangers
2231125 if these people think we are only prepared to die for him we are prepared to take up arms and kill for zuma
2231126 as government we are extremely concerned about a lot of the statements being made particularly against the judiciary which basically seems to be suggesting that our judiciary is not independent
2231127 the government as the mediator will not be giving any details about details of the talks except to say that they are progressing extremely well
2231128 my eyes were destroyed on the spot by the glass so i lost my sight i also had deep cuts all over my body and i lost a lot of blood
2231129 nobody ever came to me and said sorry not the americans not al qaeda
2231130 this was a very new phenomenon in terms of terrorism it really took the security forces by surprise
2231131 it really made the security forces reassess themselves and see what could be done
2231132 if my son has done something wrong then he should be arraigned in court and if hes guilty then he should serve his jail term if hes not they should set him free
2231133 we must double and re dedicate our efforts to fight terror but equally as we fight terrorism we must make sure that peoples human rights are not violated without just cause
2231134 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let him down
2231135 only tottenham have dared continue negotiations but as it stands nothing has developed
2231136 my desire to leave is still as strong but there is nothing more to do now other than hope for a miracle
2231137 i understand perfectly well that if i dont move on now i probably never will
2231138 im just hoping that one fine morning the bosses at gazprom will wake up in a good mood and say weve had enough of arshavins whining lets let him go
2231139 when tottenham made their offer i was sceptical at first
2231140 but after ramos called me personally and told me that that they were selling robbie keane and that he wanted me in his side the situation changed
2231141 when a coach shows an interest in you especially such a renowned and strong coach then that is already half of the success of any move
2231142 i also like the way tottenham play so i agreed in principle to join
2231143 a short while later a representative from spurs arrived to discuss my personal terms and contract
2231144 the discussion didnt take long and we agreed on everything quickly only then did my asking price go up
2231145 tottenham have a decent squad with luka modric dimitar berbatov and other players and the club is fully capable of fighting for a place in the champions league
2231146 the main thing is to try my strengths in a league like the english premier league and play against the likes of manchester united chelsea and arsenal on a regular basis rather than once every five years
2231147 i am sure tottenham will be back to make another more suitable offer for arshavins transfer
2231148 there is no set time period or deadline for this zenit are doing everything in the correct way
2231149 if tottenham can sell robbie keane to liverpool for 25 million euros then in my opinion they should pay good money for arshavin
2231150 as usually happens in russia they dont listen to the demands of the player its a dictatorship of the directors who still think they are in the old soviet union
2231151 he would have already come to tottenham but he has been treated like a slave
2231152 it felt like i played a lot better than 71 i really struggled on the greens and i had a number of putts that the hole lipped out on so it made me feel like i was putting a lot worse than i was maybe
2231153 then it even got a little bit into my longer game towards the end of the round as i was getting a bit more frustrated
2231154 and i have to sit down and get that into my head tonight and look that its only the first round
2231155 this is all you want in the first round you want to keep yourself in there its all about staying patient for the first three days and i need to get my head around that
2231156 i just need to get a bit more confidence back in my putting and that sort of gets into your game as well
2231157 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2231158 beijing you are a host to the present and a gateway to the future thank you
2231159 please compete in the spirit of olympic values excellence friendship and respect dear athletes remember that you are role models for the youth of the world reject doping and cheating
2231160 we are not daunted we are really really excited what an inspirational show we cant wait to get started on our welcome to london in four years time
2231161 everyone expected an opening ceremony of epic proportion and china did not disappoint including a most spectacular finale
2231162 we now look forward to 16 days of sport and for us 16 days of learning as we prepare for the the next summer games in london
2231163 we should not be intimidated by this we will do something just as wonderful and just as extraordinary
2231164 what beijing has done was absolutely stupendous and everyone lucky enough to be there will remember it for the rest of their lives
2231165 it is our turn now and we look forward to it even more now than we did before
2231166 it is a huge challenge but it is one that we will absolutely rise to and emulate
2231167 i did not want to come to this club and have an easy training session i wanted to come here and fight for my place in the team
2231168 fulham are a top team and they have a great gaffer here a great training ground and it was my first choice
2231169 i was always confident the deal would happen and im happy to be a fulham player i wish everton all the best but im looking forward now
2231170 i had a good few years there and enjoyed it although i had a few injuries in my second year
2231171 i have a few family back this way which is one of the reasons i wanted to come back down south
2231172 we persisted so long with the transfer because andy was the player we wanted
2231173 all transfer dealings these days especially when you are talking about a relatively large sum of money take a bit longer
2231174 i never had any doubt the transfer would not be completed and im very grateful to the chairman mohamed al fayed to bring this deal about
2231175 fulhams medicals are no more stringent than anywhere else any player who reaches andys age and who has played as many games as he has is likely to have had some problems down the line
2231176 we wanted to get it right and so did everton the only thing which was unusual was that we flagged up we were in negotiations early on and everything else was reported
2231177 maybe other clubs only announce they are interested in players once the deal has been done
2231178 as far as i am concerned there has never been a problem with the medical we have seen over his career that andy doesnt miss many games
2231179 three under par in those conditions was more than i could have hoped for i know ben curtis shot three under too but the average score today is going to be very very high and guys are going to have a hard time this afternoon so im glad to be done
2231180 i drove it a little better and had more shots from the fairway which makes it a little easier but you are just trying not to bleed to death out there
2231181 its just like the pga slice your throat on the first tee and you have to try and make it round to the 18th without dying
2231182 i wish i was a couple better yesterday putted really well today with two putts for distance so it is okay but it is just frustrating when you stand on par threes and you are hitting five iron and aiming for a greenside bunker because you know that is the only way you can make par
2231183 thats pretty sad i am very disappointed we are having to do that on such a great golf course just because of the infatuation of having to put 30 yards on par threes when they think we are hitting irons 30 yards passed where we used to
2231184 we might hit our drives 30 yards further but certainly not hitting our irons so why should we be aiming for bunkers to try and make par that personally is not right is not on its unacceptable
2231185 it was a struggle for me i did my best to be ready for the week but clearly im not
2231186 what can i say the harder i tried the worse it got i havent got the focus this week im just not with it
2231187 anybody who does well at the olympics is unlikely to do well at the us open
2231188 it makes it harder if you do well here but between the final of the olympics and the us open final is three weeks and you are going to have at least two weeks off in that time because you obviously play every second day in the slams
2231189 i think if you do all the right things in between the tournaments you can do well in both
2231190 to be involved is awesome and you also want to play well as long as i play well i wont have too many complaints ive had good preparation coming in so there is no reason why i cant do well
2231191 sometimes in tennis you can play a great match and lose if someone plays better than you ive played really well the last few months and if i can keep that up im sure i can win through a few rounds and once you get to the quarter finals anything can happen
2231192 cincinnati last week was very hot it was hotter there than it is here but the humidity is very tough you are sweating so much
2231193 its hard conditions but after a few days playing you start to get used to it i work hard and train a lot in miami and its very humid over there as well
2231194 if we want to do well in both competitions i will definitely have to play singles and doubles in the same day it obviously makes it harder but its a great opportunity for me to play in the doubles with my brother
2231195 it helps that weve played a lot together and a lot of the other teams are scratch pairings because theyve had to split up and play with someone from the same country
2231196 just because it is has been a quiet summer does not mean dic have lost interest they are happy that things have now become low key and they are awaiting developments
2231197 it is normal legal procedure for companies to wait three months after the granting of planning permission before signing the lease
2231198 this is because under planning laws the public have a right of appeal for three months after the planning permission is given
2231199 we expect the lease on stanley park to be signed in a matter of weeks
2231200 the fans need to know that we will only do whats right for the football club in the short term medium term and the long term
2231201 selling a 29 year old full back for 6million a year after we bought him for 2 5million and doing so in the knowledge that we will replace him is right for the football club in the short term medium term and the long term
2231202 if i never win an olympic medal that was my olympic medal
2231203 this goes alongside everything i have ever done in sport there have only ever been 29 flag bearers for britain and they have been some very illustrious names
2231204 if i never win an olympic medal that was it that was my olympic medal
2231205 i have had so many texts and phone calls from friends and family telling me to enjoy every minute of it and i have it has been an amazing experience
2231206 i was pretty nervous coming through the tunnel but it took my breath away when i saw 90 000 people we had such a great reception
2231207 everything has been focused on tonight it has been a huge honour my arms are getting a bit sore now tomorrow i will have a massage do some weights and start turning my mind completely to the swimming
2231208 alex hes outstanding the way he consistently produces great teams and has developed players as well as bought them i have the utmost respect for him
2231209 he is a great man at a great club but there is just something about him and them that i love beating
2231210 if im honest i think i love beating them more than i would beating even arsenal its just something thats there just like alex always wants to beat liverpool maybe
2231211 i dont know how long hes going to go on but hes been fantastic im still dreaming i know but one day i might be lucky enough to be arsenal manager and knock united off the top
2231212 yes he wasnt very happy did we deprive them of the treble or something as it turned out
2231213 he swore at me afterwards but he also gave an order he said we had to go on and win it now after beating united
2231214 in the end it depends on the board and the finances what players we can bring in but ive no doubt harry will be pushing and pushing for more hes done that since ive been here the last two years and some terrific players have come here
2231215 youve always got to believe but at the same time you have to be realistic the level of quality has gone through the roof here the last few years and weve had two consecutive top 10 finishes
2231216 last season we even managed to put the fa cup on the sideboard as well and if we did something similar in the league this time it would be an achievement
2231217 finishing 11th or 12th is not the end of the world either i dont know if weve got the quality we want to go and compete in all competitions including europe weve got the numbers certainly but going for all four i dont think so
2231218 there is always expectation especially after youve won something like the fa cup and got into the uefa cup but the uefa cup can be blessing or curse if you havent got the players you need
2231219 regarding events of the past few weeks and following full and frank discussions with the club i accept that my off field behaviour has been unprofessional and have apologised to those concerned for that
2231220 i would also like to extend that apology to the supporters who have been tremendous since my arrival at the club
2231221 i firmly believe we can gain a top six place in super league and look forward to helping achieve that
2231222 the meeting was very positive and paul particularly impressed me by showing a strong and genuine determination to make up for lost time and to get back to recapturing his best form
2231223 whilst we will monitor the situation carefully i expect paul to play an important part for us between now and the end of the season and for the remainder of his contract
2231224 chelsea have made a formal proposal to real madrid for robinho i do not know the amount but the offer has been made
2231225 robinho is very angry with the way that the directors of real madrid have been behaved towards him
2231226 he calls me every day to see if anyone has told me anything about his future and i have to tell him that i have received no calls
2231227 i have spent three days trying to speak with some of the directors at madrid but they have all disappeared
2231228 robinho does not understand anything he wants to be the best player in the world but at real madrid he cannot achieve that because they treat him like a normal player
2231229 he has liked nothing about the way that real madrid have gone about their transfer activity this summer
2231230 real madrid wanted to sign cristiano ronaldo and have not been able to
2231231 things cannot be like that because he wants to be the best and he des not have the support at real madrid he is also certain that real madrid is trying to sign david villa
2231232 robinhos plan has been to play for real madrid for many years and then go back to santos where is he going to find a better club than real madrid
2231233 people who love horrible pieces of shit will love this horrible piece of shit
2231234 and as a citizen of berlin i take pride in the words ich bin ein schwuler
2231235 because of a new and unusual threat a polar bear stuck on land due to climate change
2231236 but with recent warming the ice is miles from shore and bears are becoming increasingly trapped on land well away from their usual seal prey
2231237 the shorelines have experienced dramatic erosion because of the warming climate
2231238 to understand how such erosion was affecting the ability of millions of shorebirds attempting to gain enough food energy to fuel their southward migrations to asia south america and many other distant sites
2231239 it is ironic that our efforts to understand how climate change is affecting wildlife were disrupted by the top arctic predator displaced by climate
2231240 the uncertainty of how dangerous this or other polar bears in the region might be led to the decision to charter a bush pilot to get the crew out before a major storm made such a rescue unlikely for days
2231241 we saw the polar bear on our first clear day after several days of poor weather
2231242 but the prospect of maintaining a round the clock vigil while trying to do our surveys had us concerned
2231243 polar bears have been trapped on land in arctic alaska all spring and summer unable to swim out to sea ice and pursue seals
2231244 their condition and how dangerous they might be is unknown
2231245 if there is any real news then the club will speak but until now there have only been rumours in the papers
2231246 what have i been doing for the last 34 years i must have missed something or been asleep somewhere
2231247 they are saying because of scolaris experience chelsea are going to win the league i do not understand that
2231248 i have exactly the same squad as last season and i have to be confident it is not deteriorating i cannot see how that can possibly be the case
2231249 i would have concerns if my team was full of players the same age as ryan giggs but it is not
2231250 in people like anderson nani and tevez we will see a lot of improvement
2231251 and the older ones have looked after themselves their concentration levels are still good and so is their desire
2231252 if anything paul scholes passing is the best it has ever been
2231253 it will not be easy you expect arsenal and liverpool to improve and you would think chelsea with their experience will be there
2231254 but i have to feel this team can defend its title
2231255 at this particular time we are not in the best position fitness wise but it doesnt concern me unduly
2231256 there is a great quality in the squad and a great enthusiasm a lot of them are exhilarated by winning the european cup
2231257 we dont want one and we are not seeking one we dont have to sell the player or any player at this stage we dont have to offload players simply because of that situation
2231258 some players were going to leave anyway and that will still happen but its not entirely because of our failure to qualify for the champions league
2231259 we had some money there anyway but we are finding a difficulty in getting a level of player that we want to bring in thats been a difficult task over the close season
2231260 but there is some money there for us to bring in a couple of players yet
2231261 there are specific areas of the field that we want to improve on and hopefully in the three weeks remaining of the transfer window we will be able to do that
2231262 nobody likes to be criticised in any way shape or form
2231263 but you dont become a football manager expecting to go through your career without receiving a level of criticism
2231264 if you are not prepared to accept the criticism you shouldnt become a football mananger
2231265 it comes with the territory when you lose out in the manner we did you expect criticism and its deserved
2231266 i have to accept that ive had it before and it doesnt make it any easier at the moment but you have to try to recover and get on with it and thats exactly what we will do
2231267 we are not responsible for how people react we can only feel the disappointment of the result the other night and every one of us involved feels it
2231268 from the chairman all the way down we feel the disappointment
2231269 the one thing we have to make sure of is that the disappointment doesnt allow our domestic results to be affected
2231270 we suffered a big disappointment midweek and even after a couple of days the disappointment doesnt go away
2231271 but we have to make sure it doesnt affect our overall season
2231272 there is that little bit extra pressure on us to do well in the league and our thoughts must be on that we cant let ourselves be affected too greatly going into our first league game
2231273 like every other club when you dont have european football thats whats left for you to aim for and everybody aims to do as well as they possibly can
2231274 we would hope to do well in the league we certainly made up the gap that was there between ourselves and celtic last season and they were good enough to go on and clinch the championship at the end when we fell just short
2231275 we have to make the spl our aim for the season and the retention of the two cups we won last year would be something wed look for as well
2231276 cristiano has four years left on his contract and at some point hopefully he will extend it
2231277 he is happy at manchester united and hopefully as he gets older he will appreciate being here more and more
2231278 it does happen to players at this club they end up never wanting to leave
2231279 look at rio ferdinand he joined us as a young man from leeds united now he is a real manchester united person he loves the club
2231280 it is no different leaving london for manchester than portugal you come north you come to a colder climate you come to a wetter climate
2231281 but you also come to a real football city there are very few cities like that
2231282 his interview was very good and from my perspective he has explained himself perfectly
2231283 he is happy to be a manchester united player he always has been it is just the unfortunate participation of real madrid in the boys life has made it difficult for him however the matter is now closed
2231284 i think real madrid know they are dealing with a different animal now
2231285 i cant deny it was important for us as a club to keep him
2231286 there are very few players who have left me against my will
2231287 it is unusual for anyone to really want to leave manchester united and i think cristiano understands that too
2231288 the social and portable inbox optimizing e mail marketing in the new era of communication tools
2231289 we cannot afford the forever increasing price of transport food and electricity
2231290 we want to register our serious dissatisfaction with the way the government is dealing with these issues
2231291 my take home salary is not even enough to take me home
2231292 all the food is too expensive especially mealie mealie maize bread and milk
2231293 those are the types of food that we survive on every day
2231294 jacob zuma is a man of the people from the rural areas
2231295 he is one of the people and one of us he will help the poor of that im sure
2231296 we are consistently working with regulators toward a comprehensive solution for all auction rate securities investors
2231297 its like saying once you get into willy wonkas chocolate factory and youre in the garden where everythings edible you have it all
2231298 the technology is becoming easier and cheaper and anybody can do it and at the same time theres more incentive now to do it these are two trains on a collision course the question is when theyre going to collide
2231299 somebody with a wireless device in china should expect it to be compromised while hes there
2231300 if you can do without the device dont take it
2231301 applies to travel to virtually any overseas destination from a mediterranean beach to this months olympic games
2231302 corporate and government officials are most at risk but dont assume youre too insignificant to be targeted
2231303 its an afghan government plan he gates has endorsed and we are now working to achieve
2231304 now who would pay for that those are the discussions we are just now beginning to enter into it would be wrong to assume we are going to shoulder this burden alone
2231305 we are going to work with our allies to determine how we can finance this necessary growth
2231306 quality versus quantity we are focused there on remediating and reforming the police forces that currently exist
2231307 the main additional responsibility he is assuming is for the training mission which is just an essential mission for the afghans and for us
2231308 the sooner they are a capable fighting force and can assume responsibility for protecting their own people and their borders the sooner us forces and the worlds forces can come out
2231309 we are looking for options and ways we can streamline the command and control arrangements for us forces in afghanistan making them more efficient and effective
2231310 dont try to build a new market from scratch go where the money is
2231311 its exciting for the city and we wish him and the team and the fans all the best its going to be a great year
2231312 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2231313 let me warn you that when you get on and off the train during rush hours just be sure to follow your blockers
2231314 i cant tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons
2231315 because it will be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2231316 the attention that ive gotten since ive been here has just been overwhelming
2231317 id like to thank everyone for that the bottom line as we all know is to win games and thats what im here to do
2231318 its a huge challenge its one i never thought id have to face but as hard as i worked in green bay and as much as i prepared and got myself ready its different
2231319 my job is to play football and to be a leader for these guys and its that simple
2231320 theres no other reason for me to be up here
2231321 mi sono sentito bene ho giocato senza dolore sto migliorando giorno dopo giorno da oltre una settimana che lavoravo per questo rientro chiaro mi manca un po il ritmo partita ma andato tutto bene come speravamo
2231322 i really like pierre dreossi the clubs general manager and i believe that is reciprocal
2231323 at the end of last season he promised me that if there was a good offer he would accept that i could leave
2231324 this offer exists it comes from everton who want to buy me for more than 8million euros
2231325 i want to leave rennes everton are offering me 1 5 million euros a year rennes could never offer me that much
2231326 i owe everything to rennes my formative club but they must understand me in africa i have a family to feed and i am very ambitious
2231327 everton are a very established club in the premier league managed by david moyes a coach who puts trust in youngsters
2231328 i have spoken to him on the phone he wanted to invite me to visit the club i hadnt the time to do it
2231329 it annoys me when i hear the rennes directors say i am going to extend my contract i am not going to extend my contract
2231330 rennes must understand me there are things you cant turn down
2231331 i want the directors to come to an agreement i have confidence in that
2231332 i have seen that rennes have recruited a player with the same profile as me kader mangane signed from lens this week
2231333 nobody from barca has asked me about berbatov there has been no movement on that front all i know is what i read in the papers
2231334 we will have to wait and see what happens it is a question of waiting a bit more and then we will see how things turn out
2231335 all i can say about that is that i know nothing about it either we have a list of forwards and we are working on that not on what journalists or agents are saying
2231336 many things have been said and half of them are just not true
2231337 if we look at things along general lines then tottenham are the club that has been the busiest this summer
2231338 all the major clubs will finish changing their squads next week the champions league starts then and some leagues too
2231339 i do not expect many surprises but there could be some interesting late moves
2231340 they need some minutes on the clock before the start of the season
2231341 the community shield is a prestigious match but i have used players in it who were not quite fit and we are more or less in the same situation again
2231342 you can suffer this kind of thing from time to time when you have had a cruciate operation
2231343 we are trying to manage the swelling but he is not ready to take part in any games it is unfortunate for the lad because he was looking forward to the new season
2231344 frankie was on the phone to wish all the boys the best of luck and to tell them despite his disappointment he will be cheering them on on the television
2231345 its going to be painful for frankie but hes been a part of the team for a long time now and hes still a part of it i wouldnt expect anything less of frankie to support the team even though hes on the other side of the world
2231346 frankie will undoubtedly be a motivating factor i have told the lads they have got to concentrate on their own games now but they told me to a man they are now even more determined to do it for frankie
2231347 its an unseeded draw and it has not been kind to us all the team have proved they can beat the best in the world and they will have to do it again
2231348 the injuries to craig and lewin are a real worry for us this close to the qualifiers craig is a very important player for us while lewin has become a reliable defender
2231349 it is more worrying because we also look likely to be without central defenders james collins and danny gabbidon
2231350 the news on james is encouraging he may even be available next month i think we will have to wait a little longer for danny
2231351 the game in wrexham for the under 21s takes centre stage it would be a huge boost for welsh football if they could qualify for sweden so brian can have anyone he wants to boosts his squad
2231352 some of the players in brians squad who he decides not to use will come back to the senior squad for the georgia game
2231353 this game gives me a chance to look at other candidates for starting spots come the world cup ties
2231354 i do not look upon this game as a rehearsal for the world cup games we need to see who arrives on the monday before the azerbaijan match before we can make any decisions

2231358 do we get the back pocket warranty on that repair
2231359 well most of your repairs work till we see your back pockets go into the elevator
2231360 do any of you ever notice how the first mate always stares at major brills breast when he talks to her
2231361 its because they are at eye level to the little guy
2231362 i used to do drugs i still do but i used to also
2231363 i used to have a crack problem but now i dont smoke it anymore hardly ever that much
2231364 las relaciones con el partido siempre las he tenido y las he mantenido
2231365 no se trata de recomponer relaciones la verdad es que las relaciones siempre las he tenido y las he mantenido por supuesto que a veces uno dice cosas que no todos van a compartir pero lo que quiero decir es que aqu estamos pensando en algo mucho m s grande que despu s de 20 a os de gobierno de la concertaci n la alianza va a llegar a gobernar chile
2231366 podemos tener ideas pol ticas distintas discrepancias sobre formas de actuar maneras de relacionarse con el gobierno cada uno puede tener su propia opini n

2231376 dont get me wrong i think westwood is one of the class golfers of this era i am sincerely rooting for him but an honest opinion would have been one concerning the golf course taking a switch to his backside i score it oakland hills cc winning the first round 10 8 with one knockdown on the 16th hole a player of his calibre still has plenty of time to recover though ding ding round 2
2231377 jm singh usually seems to hit decent first rounds followed by poor second ones i wager he shoots 75 or worse today
2231378 i feel sorry for you and the ugly heart your church has
2231379 the things theyre saying about their lady of guadalupe are completely unbiblical they give her attributes and power and authority that belong only to god
2231380 is known to be a powerful intercessor being the mother of god when jesus mother asks him to do something its known that jesus generally will do what his mother asks
2231381 the mother of god desired that a chapel be built to which she could invite her children to come on pilgrimage
2231382 the spirituality of the turtle is one of sacredness and closeness to the earth the earth is the center of our lives physically but spiritually its a real center for me
2231383 two young eagles began circling cavorting in the air dipping down toward the statue and loudly calling out said jack socha a shrine spokesman
2231384 on behalf of south west trains i would like to wish you a pleasant journey
2231385 this week were on fire for god gods doing incredible things last month or the month before we were at youth camp god impacted our lives but what about in between were you still led by fire or were you led back to sin
2231386 te has portado peor que todos los que vivieron antes de ti al extremo de hacerte otros dioses dolos de metal esto me enfurece pues me has dado la espalda
2231387 the fairways are narrow if you miss the semi rough by a foot you are worse off than if you miss by 20 yards
2231388 you have to reward the accurate players like they did at the us open
2231389 i had a shot on the fourth hit a driver and because the fairways are firming up ran through the fairway a foot into the rough and i couldnt even get a lob wedge to the green and i only had 95 yards to the front
2231390 it is a difficult course anyway with the greens and the pin positions to protect it
2231391 i am not sure you need rough as long as it is and you certainly dont need to sweep it back towards the tee the night before the tournament when we have played it as it is in the practice rounds
2231392 i cant recall it happening before and cant think of a reason why they would do it other than to irritate the players as that is all it does
2231393 i asked my partners if i was out of order and they said no if you are slightly off line you are crucified
2231394 they are sucking the fun out of the major championships when you set it up like that
2231395 they actually ended up having the perception of supporting doug lamborn
2231396 congressman lamborn has consistently questioned the value of debating opponents who agree with him and his voting record on all the major issues he remains skeptical
2231397 congressman lamborn has always been widely and readily available to constituents through phone e mail letters and radio and tv call in programs
2231398 congressman lamborn is only interested in talking about the issues not personalities
2231399 neither these tactics nor the intervention from the likes of tom delay have any place in colorado politics
2231400 i think there are other strategies and tactics that get us far closer to advancing the cause of human life
2231401 ik ben de enige die een klacht kan indienen bij de fifa
2231402 en ik zeg neen neen en nog eens neen kompany mag zijn eerste kaart dan wel onterecht vinden hij zal zijn straf uitzitten daar kom ik niet op terug
2231403 de rechtbank legt de lat in zijn argumentatie zo hoog dat het bijna uitgesloten wordt voor een journalist om over rechtszaak te berichten
2231404 hopelijk legt de uitkomst van het beroepshof de beperkingen bloot van de vrije meningsuiting in het land
2231405 ethiopische journalisten zijn omringd door vijandige instellingen de regering rechters en zakenlui
2231406 de wet beschermt de persvrijheid niet en geeft zelfs wapens aan diegenen die de pers willen berispen
2231407 those who dance are considered insane by those who cant hear the music
2231408 i thought james fowler did well last season but i felt we needed a bit of cover in that area as well
2231409 hes a really good lad hes settled in quickly and im sure he will do really well for us
2231410 we are used to playing on a sunday in italy and so we watch the scottish matches on occasions on a saturday
2231411 i know all the celtic and rangers players because they also play in the champions league and celtic have an italian player massimo donati and they have shunsuke nakamura who played for a long time in italy
2231412 oder er vermengt die antworten streicht die 99 ausschm ckung weg und erkennt dann wie unglaublich de und langweilig mein leben war bevor ich mich hals ber kopf in meinen
2231413 eliminate confusion among investors and consumers alike regarding various names in use for fannie mae
2231414 she has decided that she will need a few more weeks than originally planned to be ready for her return to the stage
2231415 at that time he will still be considered an enemy combatant but he will be eligible for review by an administrative review board
2231416 it is my duty as president of the jury to inform you that this military commission sentences you to be confined for 66 months
2231417 it was a sorry or sad thing to see innocent people killed
2231418 i personally present my apologies to them if anything what i did have caused them pain
2231419 do justice for all the victims of material support for terrorism in this case
2231420 and they have sentenced him hicks to nine months and the term of his prison is over within his own country and he is free with his family right now with his children
2231421 this sale is brought about as the present lord has been diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer
2231422 for sale as a whole or in part can include david the existing eccentric lord of the manor physically as well to a suitable purchaser
2231423 only family members were allowed to see them as the lawyers have no power to make arguments during the hearing
2231424 what were finding is that human beings are probably driven tremendously by comparison unless you understand those comparisons youre not going to understand the rate of obesity
2231425 understanding the sociology of obesity is much more important than understanding the biology
2231426 they may not be aware of it our computers can trace out these patterns without the individual necessarily knowing them
2231427 we can win with what we got are you saying that you dont have any friends that are puker fans they will hold it over your heads forever you won the superbowl with our qb play the hand of cards we got and get off the bf bs
2231428 anyone can see this is painful from 50 feet away
2231429 i wanted people to understand the psychological ramifications of this
2231430 we have good news for democracy mr zardari said at a joint news conference with sharif in islamabad
2231431 the coalition believes it is imperative to move for impeachment against general musharraf
2231432 immediately launch the proceedings and draw up a charge sheet against mr musharraf a two thirds combined majority in the upper and lower houses of parliament is necessary for impeachment
2231433 the presidents options are either to issue an order dissolving the national assembly or impose emergency rule under which the government will be suspended and a new caretaker set up would be announced the source told afp
2231434 the democracy is not that weak now that the threat can be used
2231435 his policies have weakened the federation and eroded trust in national institutions mr zardari said
2231436 the incompetence and failure of his policies has thrown the country into the worst power shortage in its history
2231437 the coalition doesnt have the numbers they are fooling the people said chaudhry shujaat hussain the leader of the pro musharraf pakistan muslim league q party which was in government until february
2231438 its about soldiers being conned into going into battle for like business men it isnt even a cause anymore
2231439 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2231440 tskhinvali and the heights around tskhinvali and the majority of the villages in south ossetia are under the control of georgian forces
2231441 russian armoured vehicles have entered the northern suburbs of tskhinvali
2231442 what russia is doing in georgia is open unhidden aggression and a challenge to the whole world
2231443 if the whole world does not stop russia today then russian tanks will be able to reach any other european capital
2231444 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2231445 about 1400 died we will check these figures but the order of the numbers is around this we have this on the basis of reports from relatives
2231446 i want to reiterate on his behalf that the united states supports georgias territorial integrity and we call for an immediate ceasefire
2231447 i am deeply concerned over the dramatic situation in georgia and i deplore the loss of human lives and the suffering inflicted on the civilian population
2231448 lea t hampton is going broke glam town 12m in the hole
2231449 everybody perceives east hampton to be the home of the rich and famous
2231450 when the summers over its just the same old town just like all these other towns
2231451 the disparity between rich and poor is probably unmatched anywhere in the world you have the heads of multinational corporations billionaires but of the year round population half the work force are undocumented immigrants living below the poverty level
2231452 i dont mind providing the programs but what the general public has to understand is that we dont manufacture money here
2231453 jarvis is a talented guy who we recruited when he was in high school
2231454 it was a very extensive review from officiating to talking to people in las vegas to talking to pamon to talking to government officials
2231455 its hard to prove a negative that they didnt make mistakes but we found no evidence in any of our follow ups done by other people and ourselves that indicated there was anything wrong in those games
2231456 we talked to pamon specifically about sports gambling in these games more generally and he adamantly contested the notion
2231457 we found people who were telling us that wasnt true at all
2231458 what it really means in a credit report is the protection of bankruptcy has been taken away which is not a good thing
2231459 so that one was on us we had seen it but we misinterpreted it
2231460 officials will be required to disclose any non sports related gambling activities
2231461 and they will be prohibited from engaging in these activities during the period of time encompassing their officiating assignments
2231462 the good that came out of this is the processes are tighter
2231463 the bad situation is we didnt do everything we could have done because we werent doing it annually once you do it you have to do it really well and we could have done it better
2231464 we looked at their performance and made some decisions with respect to next year for our whole staff not just these guys
2231465 you would not have a difficult time tracking whos on our staff when the season starts
2231466 as a result of these market trends gmac is taking steps to reduce the volume of new lease originations in the u s
2231467 as part of our annual august model year clearance we are leveraging the move from leasing to retail purchases to offer our customers the best deals of the year and make buying as affordable as renting
2231468 i remember it being like 40 below or something crazy like that
2231469 but winter is really a breeze when you think about those less fortunate than yourself
2231470 we somalians compare winter to other scenarios we could be stuck in
2231471 if i rhymed about home and got descriptive id make 50 cent look like limp bizkit
2231472 america has places like new orleans with real struggles and i respect those struggles
2231473 that song is me talking to rappers who glorify their hood like its the end of the world somalians are happy if we even get to live in their hood their hood is our salvation
2231474 even though i didnt understand the language just the fact that i was listening to foreign music gave me a place to dream
2231475 the rare rapper who doesnt exploit or more accurately glorify his difficult past his music and words mean a lot to me as an african because it has truth and dignity and its extremely funky
2231476 i used the b 3 hammond organ that bob marley actually used on exodus
2231477 id say i sketched out my first ideas of what i wanted to do musically when i lived there
2231478 i was in the scenario that most somalian people are living in there which is just kind of struggling it out
2231479 in minneapolis when you see the somalian community its clear the lack of representation in the media that was the thing i most thought about when i was there i saw something was missing so id come home and write which started me down this path
2231480 i couldve just been the good entertainer and everybody would have been happy but i had to say something how many kids who came from where i did the streets of mogadishu would ever get that kind of chance
2231481 i could say nothing about the somalian experience and still live pretty well make my money
2231482 but i have a true passion for my country and my people and for justice thats what keeps me from being quiet
2231483 as an artist who wants to speak for all the people its hard to say anything or to take a side even my mother would like for me to not talk about it
2231484 the ultra compact surface mount package expands the potential applications for the tps859 which could range from large applications such as flat panel displays and various home appliances to small applications including cell phones and digital cameras
2231485 in addition the new filtering technology and the lower operating voltage improve both the sensitivity and the power saving capabilities of the component
2231486 the real triumph of this tour is that we havent strangled each other
2231487 not to say it hasnt crossed my mind or andys or stewarts
2231488 we had a really good defense and we held them to 31
2231489 we lost i think one regular season game over the next four years
2231490 well see where this thing goes but i think it will be a while
2231491 its very very good and it hasnt reached its peak yet its a beautiful thing and a scary thing to watch what it does like option football does it makes a lot of one on one tackling i mean you put people on islands and then you strand them every time you do that its hard
2231492 you got to be able to play in space with guys who can run
2231493 in college football everybody wants their best players on offense most of your head coaches are offensive head coaches your best athletes a lot of them are on offense i think that has to change a little bit were going to have to try to divvy it up a little bit were going to need more of that type of athletes on defense too i may take a hit a little bit with the run game and really just focus on having athletes on the field playing that style of ball
2231494 the biggest issue is your speed on the field on defense
2231495 and athleticism guys that can play in space tackle in space cover pressure i think youre going to see quicker and lighter linebackers overall so you have to try and match their speed
2231496 i would talk to norm chow the ucla offensive coordinator and say look when were able to get off the field youve got to keep us off the field those offenses are stressful the more the defenses are on the field youre giving the offense opportunities to make plays on us you have to play a little bit more ball control on your offense
2231497 the driver saw that the bridge was moving and was starting to fall
2231498 he immediately slammed on the emergency brakes and hid in the engine compartment of the locomotive six seconds later there was the shock and it was still going at 120 km h
2231499 our carriage was full of young people and we were having fun then there was the crash chaos people were dying they had no legs and arms i am alive i have been born again
2231500 please get back to me if you have any questions
2231501 though we dont think this type of advertising is appropriate for college sports we have tried this once before in this country and it didnt work very well
2231502 beer promotion during college sports telecasts undermines the best interests of higher education and compromises the efforts of colleges and others to combat sometimes epidemic levels of alcohol problems on many campuses today
2231503 we find it puzzling that ncaa advertising rules prohibit ads for cigarettes other tobacco products organizations promoting gambling and alcoholic beverages yet continue to allow ads for beverages with alcohol content of 6 percent or less beer the top alcoholic drink of college students
2231504 given the devastating problems caused by underage and excessive drinking much of it in the form of beer this policy makes little sense and flouts the core values of sports and learning
2231505 i think weve taken a very sensible very rationale very conservative approach and weve asked that any company that advertises alcohol during our games continue to include the message drink responsibly on its ads
2231506 i think weve taken about as a conservative an approach as any sport in the country while not everyone agrees 100 percent i think we represent what is a good balance in that opinion
2231507 our bylaws lump together names images and likenesses and the names are being used now so well have to go back and look at this
2231508 we will need to go back and look at our options we certainly are not giving up our model of amateurism
2231509 penetration levels of humira within each of its six approved uses are still very low
2231510 abbot coming from nowhere now has the opportunity to be the dominant player in that market
2231511 youre getting the benefit of significant diversification across product areas on a global scale
2231512 watch the disease progress in a dish that is to watch what goes right or wrong
2231513 i think well see in years ahead that this opens the door to a new way to treating degenerative diseases
2231514 represent a collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models for the most part in studying them
2231515 the hope is that this will accelerate research and it will create a climate of openness
2231516 at least for the foreseeable future and i would argue forever they are going to be extremely valuable tools
2231517 so einen kraftakt wie wir ihn letztes jahr gemacht haben k nnen wir als fc bayern nicht jedes jahr machen es sei denn man geht gro es risiko
2231518 ive been out throwing footballs and its still the same routine
2231519 i was like im satisfied this is awesome either way
2231520 its the hardest part of the game the hardest part of coaching and the hardest part of playing especially when youve got a guy like that who does everything right
2231521 hes such a big part of what we were planning to do and i know he was going to have a great season weve got to handle it deal with it and go on but its not easy
2231522 this is one of the most spectacular finds in europe
2231523 this find will open up an area of paleontological research in the area
2231524 it is sensational to discover a near complete skeleton like this is unique in romania and a rarity in the world
2231525 it is important because it can give us complete information about the flora and fauna or the era
2231526 bus stopping at next bus stop please stand well clear of doors
2231527 developed a valuable niche between the expensive car dealer service operations and the inexpensive single service shops such as oil change outfits
2231528 companies are continuing to invest in technology to reduce costs and enhance their information technology infrastructures
2231529 we are pleased with the direction of our football program under the leadership of ron
2231530 he has a plan in place and is right on course with that plan
2231531 i am very appreciative of the commitment that the university has shown to our organization
2231532 the administration has proven its long term commitment to us as a program as evident in the current facility expansion and other projects that are essential for sustained success
2231533 we feel that we are on schedule with our plan of building a fast tough strong and disciplined program and are looking forward to this season and many seasons to come
2231534 aufgrund der verletzungssorgen unserer innenverteidigung haben wir schnell reagiert und sind sehr froh dass wir einen spieler verpflichten konnten der so viel erst und zweitligaerfahrung mitbringt
2231535 ich will ein teil zur erfolgsgeschichte des fsv frankfurt beitragen
2231536 but hes a pretty resilient kid obviously hes quite disappointed himself but hes got a lot of good options out there
2231537 bens a good friend of mine and weve been through a lot of stuff together
2231538 our discovery indicates that by following a calorie restriction diet for six months and then taking alpha lipoic acid while eating normally the same life extension effects will be experienced
2231539 this is a groundbreaking solution and were very happy to be the first to test it
2231540 mobile advertising provides a compelling opportunity for brands and their media agencies while allowing our customers to consume more mobile services for less
2231541 when you think about it one day you could actually save somebodys life to me thats something really important that you should do
2231542 we thought it would be like anything else a one year thing you go in you go out the doctors didnt mention a bone marrow transplant or anything well do treatment were good to go
2231543 but now were starting to talk bone marrow transplant because some of the therapy is not working
2231544 if youre a caucasian a plain vanilla caucasian your chance of getting a match is about 80 percent but it drops off dramatically if youre a minority
2231545 these guys are young their cells are viable they will be able to donate for many years which is extremely important and theyre male those are big criteria
2231546 those are the ones we really want because those are the ones that are going to graft or actually work in a patient
2231547 i thought heck why couldnt we weve got a lot of strong healthy young guys if theyre willing to do it
2231548 we just informed them that if they wanted to thered be this opportunity
2231549 hopefully a lot of division i schools will see what coach stoops is doing and then hopefully do it
2231550 if we get all these numbers of people to get their dna out there youre bound to find someone who will meet your match and save thousands or millions of lives
2231551 i think as much as anything just the general public doesnt realize maybe how easy it is to be on the registry i just did it in a total of 5 minutes
2231552 i understand there will be a process if i were to be a donor for it but i think to help someone to improve their life or to give them a chance to live its worth it maybe the little bit of discomfort it might be to give them that chance
2231553 theres a lot of kids who need bone marrow transplants and its just an opportunity for us to add to the possibilities that theyll find a match and that theyll be able to get the transplant that they need
2231554 a lot of these kids need it to help them live so its just something that we can do to help people out
2231555 a religious system that promises happiness and nice things is difficult to reconcile with the faith whose founder had no place to lay his head urged his followers not to store up treasures on earth and called on them to deny themselves and take up a cross of suffering
2231556 my problem with the prosperity gospel movement is that it is too easy to morph into a justification for selfishness and elitism
2231557 nobody wants to be mother teresa but the least we can do is hold her up as an exemplar
2231558 what role does god or your faith play in helping you get through tough financial times
2231559 there is nothing surprising about the fact that nearly 4 out of 5 low income americans regard their faith as a comfort in hard economic times
2231560 i have not seen a scientific poll but observation tells me that people who have little materially seem to trust god more than those who have an abundance
2231561 apparently there are no atheists in foxholes or in recessions
2231562 trust god ask the hard budgetary questions of yourself and your family and make the tough decisions
2231563 ich freue mich dass wir jetzt eine zus tzliche alternative im sturm haben die uns in der neuen saison weiterhelfen wird
2231564 whatever the proper resolution of the extraordinarily important questions presented the public interest clearly favors further consideration of issues before defendants are required to take actions that may forever alter the constitutional balance of separation of powers
2231565 the bush cheney administration continues to defy our validly issued congressional subpoenas for information relevant to the politicization of the department of justice by this white house
2231566 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process for prosecuting detainees
2231567 as a former offensive coordinator i know the pressure it puts on a defense
2231568 and just the tempo changes the game from a conditioning standpoint a physiological standpoint and a mental standpoint
2231569 theres a saying in sport that fatigue makes cowards of all men
2231570 i think its the most true thing in all of sports
2231571 fatigue makes cowards of us all men in condition do not tire
2231572 that first day of bowl practice we ran four times as many snaps in half the time
2231573 you can be frisky and everything but the moment you reach fatigue it doesnt matter youre dying
2231574 kind of like the fight with george foreman and muhammad ali where ali set back on the ropes for seven or eight rounds and took the beating then all of a sudden foreman was dead his arms were gone and he ali knocks him out thats kind of the philosophy of this thing eventually fatigue will set in even though it might set in on you too because youre playing at such a fast tempo you know what youre doing and they dont
2231575 we can get to the line get set and see what the defense is doing
2231576 instead of the defense watching us and our personnel we get to see their personnel theyre bringing in
2231577 we dont have transmitters in helmets as nfl quarterbacks do the offensive coordinator cant just call something to the quarterback and then its out there the coordinator calls it the offensive coach on the field signals it the quarterback processes it and gets it to the rest of the offense now youre going to the line of scrimmage that clock is going down so its an issue were all going to have to manage
2231578 they concentrate better theyre having more fun theyre more involved as a team
2231579 i really like the attitude of our team its the way we practice they are focused more theyll get bored because its not quite as complex in some areas as the west coast offense getting bored sometimes is good it means its simple
2231580 well because my belief is eventually the tempo will win
2231581 it may not win early but eventually its going to win
2231582 if you think about it how many times do you have an extremely complicated nfl offense that has six shifts and motions before the snap with these geniuses and they run it and they lose two yards i could have done the same thing in a lot less time ive always thought im as smart as them ill just lose it faster
2231583 we were slap worn out by the end of the spring game
2231584 ladies is your no good man secretly a woman hater
2231585 we dont want any fornication going on in this band
2231586 we all love the bangles sleater kinney tegan and sara
2231587 we like it being an all girl thing we want to be a band that represents for sure
2231588 she still comes to the shows and loves it when we point her out
2231589 hey guys thats sarah over there walking toward the bar
2231590 you know he wanted it he really really wanted it but he always wanted what he couldnt have
2231591 i was essentially living on a rock and would only see bands on american tv i picked up a guitar when i was 13 and i knew thats what i wanted to do
2231592 there were ladies in like camping chairs waiting for en vogue and when they saw us come up they were like oh great
2231593 but by the end they were like yeah you go girl if we can win them over im confident we can win a lot of people over
2231594 i have called melissa several times to say how much i love her blog
2231595 the only way this blog would be better is if she dedicated 50 of the posts to affordable housing
2231596 not as good as beth spotswoods blog but i like it anyway
2231597 the jury believed mr penn and did not believe kerrs defense that the product it distributed did not release harmful
2231598 we have seen first hand how asbestos has wreaked havoc on americans working in naval shipyards automobile plants and the construction industry most often this is through their employers conscious choice for profits over a workers health
2231599 the isps have made a counter proposal that they are prepared to support streamlining the process to allow the copyright holders access to subscriber details so they can take legal action
2231600 afact claims to have the ip addresses but its alleged even then the isp cant say who at the address did the downloading the due legal process must be followed in our legal system the existing usage terms and conditions talk about illegal activity and not alleged illegal activity people are presumed innocent until found guilty by a legally constituted court
2231601 they never did it again its a very effective way of educating users
2231602 im not sure people would be comfortable in living in a society where their internet connection can be terminated without the allegation being tested in court
2231603 the frustration for consumers is when theres something good that people are talking about in the rest of the world like flight of the conchords that was available elsewhere six months before here
2231604 people go for illegal choices because there is no legal way to download this stuff
2231605 the industry has rallied like weve never seen the industry rally before
2231606 weve got a problem but we dont know how big it is
2231607 the jurys kind of still out on the impact but it cant be a good impact
2231608 sort of the delta airplane hub of the west in terms of migration
2231609 if you tried to get insurance with how big you are youd never get covered
2231610 i could write a book on this one subject alone if only you did great grandpa grizzly that would be very interesting to see how these imported scalists socialists could come and organize the farmers and i w w s to gather and organization that would destroy the farmers first and then all other taxpayers and to this day there is lots of farmers just as blind as ever
2231611 we can confirm that the divorce is final they remain the best of friends and their family is obviously the priority
2231612 ive managed to bring artur on loan today for a month so everything is up and ready for crawley away
2231613 i didnt enjoy telling josh this morning but i told him two weeks ago that id have a little look at him and see how it was
2231614 its a difficult one crawley away because josh let six in there it was my call i just had to make a decision thats what get paid for
2231615 whether its the right decision or the wrong decision only time will tell but josh has accepted it very well
2231616 one thing about the civil war a kind of material and a kind of object that could express that kind of loss
2231617 i dont know the temperature might get back high i dont know might even melt tomorrow morning
2231618 thats the fun you dont know what the weather brings makes the guessing fun
2231619 i already had it in my brain 28 hours 28 minutes
2231620 the more the ice melts the more your guess costs starting at 2 then 3 then 5 til there are no more guesses
2231621 there is no science behind it i guessed for a slot early friday and one friday afternoon
2231622 i dont want to sound morbid but my mom passed away on the 28th so i said 28 hours 28 minutes thats the big science behind my guess
2231623 i think im gonna guess for friday because if it rains no that might help it melt so i say friday friday morning
2231624 low informati same sex marriage and abortion to be on californias fall ballot
2231625 low informati obama decree of unilaterally disarmament alarms allies and encourages enemies
2231626 one of the most importan hillary held center stage tonight jan 24 2008 ind
2231627 we have been sort of like john mccain but not co florida republicans boycott todays primary in sympathy with democrats
2231628 we have been sort of like john mccain but not co hillary held center stage tonight jan 24 2008 ind
2231629 but the event has grown so much that we decided to make it free for the whole community
2231630 i just really i thank the staff at elvis presley hospital and many many thanks to my many well wishers its great to know people care about you
2231631 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2231632 any decisions we make that affect atlanta could affect every other airport in the country
2231633 i dont really like the idea of people coming here with weapons and carrying them into terminals but thats their right as citizens of the state of texas
2231634 if airports think guns should not be allowed they should have the right to modify their security plan to reflect that
2231635 there is no justification for permitting firearms at any airport
2231636 you might like to have a gun in your car because you come home on an 11 30 p m flight
2231637 wir h tten auch ein zwei tore mehr machen k nnen wir m ssen auf dem platz besser miteinander sprechen das werden wir im training verbessern es ist aber egal wie hauptsache wir haben gewonnen
2231638 der sieg war klar verdient trier ist f r die 4 liga eine gute mannschaft und spielt gut nach vorne in der zweiten halbzeit waren wir deutlich besser vor allem was die balleroberung angeht
2231639 any decisions we make that affect atlanta could affect every other airport in the country
2231640 i dont really like the idea of people coming here with weapons and carrying them into terminals but thats their right as citizens of the state of texas
2231641 this is a solid example of government collaborating with the private sector to conceptualize and produce a product that really works to improve and advance the security process
2231642 we put the challenge out there and bag manufacturers overwhelming responded with innovative products that provide a win win for travelers and tsa
2231643 im not so sure he shouldnt be impeached or recalled whichever is swifter for doing that
2231644 i dont care whos looking but dont i look cool anyways
2231645 weve found that even simple changes to improve usability are difficult or impossible to make at papers in the us
2231646 waiting for the next threat and reacting with some wimpy promotion is not a plan
2231647 with a little cooperation we might find that craigslist can help to turn around newspapers
2231648 our inability to deliver small targeted audiences is a significant reason behind why newspaper classifieds arent selling as well as they used to
2231649 maybe we could stop blaming the customers or the competition or craig newmark and think up a classified product that people might actually like
2231650 we shouldnt be afraid to knock down our walls and share our classifieds with other newspapers or even with other websites
2231651 facebook may have the superior technology but it doesnt have the users in germany
2231652 we apologize for the confusion but in an abundance of caution we treated this unaccounted for laptop as a serious potential breach
2231653 were glad to confirm that a preliminary investigation shows no personal information was compromised
2231654 the republican nominees advisers brush off the charges arguing that the spot was meant to be a
2231655 am i the only one who doesnt see creativity or humor in these ads
2231656 the ad was the creation of fred davis one of mccains top media gurus and the nephew of conservative oklahoma senator james inhofe
2231657 support our troops because we are the only patriots in the country
2231658 pull out everything you want to get me elected stuff you wouldnt even dream of doing for bush
2231659 its not what a person believes or should believe its what the age is
2231660 were continuing our investigation to see if there are other crimes we should be charging other offenses
2231661 i dont believe in knee jerk reactions to violations of the law i dont believe that we just pass anything to get gang legislation on the books
2231662 i think that it needs to be effective and protect that ability to assemble
2231663 i think we need to protect the constitution as much as possible
2231664 but we also need to protect the citizenry and gang members are dangerous
2231665 there is not one celebrity no rapper no president no nobody who is standing in the gap for you and we got this big old youth problem aint doing jack because the problems just as bad or worse as it was before
2231666 i didnt have stuff growing up so its interesting to see what people will do in desperation and all you really have to do is offer them something and they can help themselves
2231667 law enforcement we just happen to be on the front lines were the boots on the ground
2231668 so are the teachers so are social workers so are health care professionals that are treating gunshot victims in the er
2231669 you know little league coaches high school coaches you name were all stakeholders
2231670 so its not just a law enforcement issue its an everybody issue
2231671 women are more scared of dirty old men than tall black guys
2231672 i know im often my own worst enemy i take time to answer rude readers who dont deserve it and hey look i twitter
2231673 in the cave you can stay as long as you want and control your own experience the boatride is quick
2231674 entre todos podemos lograr la reparaci n hist rica del chaco
2231675 me emocion cuando cantaron el himno con toda la fuerza lindo y c lido me gustar a que mucha gente escuche hablar a esta directora vieran las caras y la organizaci n de estos padres porque yo como ella creo que los cambios se dan con la educaci n y tambi n con la organizaci n comunitaria
2231676 una obra muy sentida porque ha tenido varios traslados pero la verdad es un hecho muy emotivo el empuje que tiene la comunidad para transformar su propia realidad
2231677 quiero reconocer que como ministra de desarrollo social acompa e a estas lejanas tierras de el impenetrable es para nosotros motivo de satisfacci n y orgullo lo que establece el compromiso social con la argentina y el chaco
2231678 recorro a lo largo y a lo ancho del pa s y siempre que veo a los chicos como ustedes llego a comprender m s el enorme compromiso que tiene nuestro gobierno con nuestra presidenta cristina fern ndez de kirchner para transformar las realidades por que comandancia fr as su pueblo su gente se merece mucho mas
2231679 quiere nuestro gobierno son hechos y por eso cuando los veo con esta esperanza le pido a dios por favor que no nos equivoquemos y que hagamos las cosas bien que respondamos a las expectativas de ustedes
2231680 but put a sex story out there and our beltway insiders are on it priorities people
2231681 hey if the edwards story is true might that cover on the globe about obama be true as well
2231682 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address at the convention
2231683 have lives personal lives that indicate something about what kind of human being they are
2231684 i think it is crucial for democratic voters and caucus goers to determine who they can trust whos honest who is sincere who has integrity
2231685 its hard to believe that boxing fan john mccain couldnt see this left cross coming after he threw this stiff jab
2231686 point about how the beltway insider media have been grading mccain on a curve
2231687 i was the greatest critic of the initial four years three and a half years
2231688 did you guys know mccain has a comprehensive energy policy
2231689 i hate to say it but pariss energy platform is very well tanned
2231690 i find it shocking that a man with such contempt for women isnt called out on it for the most part even those who have said its terrible seem to have a boys will be boys tone where is the outrage
2231691 gas is 4 78 per gallon in hawaii and yet barack obama doesnt want to cover the planet with oil wells which might in 15 years or so bring the price of gas in hawaii back down to well probably around 4 78 per gallon by then figuring for inflation
2231692 and overall mccains campaign has gotten three times more money from the industry than obamas has 1 3 million compared to about 394 000
2231693 if barack obama were a real american he would have come close to flunking out of school only to be rescued by the fact that his daddy had a lot of influence and stepped in to rescue him
2231694 mccain leads the money race with nearly every other top giver in the oil and gas industry though
2231695 obama pretty clearly demonstrated his merit at harvard by heading up the law review
2231696 what were calling individual talent is actually a function of that individuals social position or opportunities gained by virtue of family and ancestry
2231697 mccain on the other hand had to rely on other people taking the blame for his violations of the honor code in order to avoid expulsion at annapolis where he was legacied in
2231698 mccain did in faith of my fathers write about his shame driven attempts to commit suicide after
2231699 i will go puzzle over that assertion of bush holding a valid resume and experience to be president
2231700 i made a lot more money in the past three years than i would had i not been going to afghanistan
2231701 id rather stay here and not make the extra money at this point
2231702 when people are getting paid more because of hazardous duty pay theyre all coming back and spending it our businesses are all reaping the benefits theyre able to pay the employees a little bit better
2231703 you have a lot of these folks heavily trained that are exiting the military at the rate of 7 000 annually thats a lot of very very employable people
2231704 he promises more taxes on small business seniors your life savings your family
2231705 capital gains tax increases would not directly affect most working people saving for retirement
2231706 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standard deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
2231707 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
2231708 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
2231709 vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year
2231710 factcheck org a nonpartisan web site said the vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year the 32 000 figure it said was the amount of taxable income those people had
2231711 would have allowed tax rates to return to pre 2001 levels meaning that an individual with taxable income of about 32 000 would have faced a tax increase
2231712 at issue is obamas vote on a non binding budget resolution in march that called for president bushs tax cuts to expire such a step would have allowed tax rates to return to pre 2001 levels meaning that an individual with taxable income of about 32 000 would have faced a tax increase taxable income is whats left after taxpayers account for deductions
2231713 the senate voted to stand up for working families in illinois and throughout the nation
2231714 today the senate voted to stand up for working families in illinois and throughout the nation by rejecting the failed policies of the bush administration and moving our country back on track to fiscal discipline our country needs change and this budget is an important step in the right direction i commend house and senate leaders for working together to move this legislation through congress
2231715 statement of senator barack obama on the senate s passage of the fy 2009 budget resolution
2231716 i look forward to the ad that scolds obama for totally not lusting after white women
2231717 local arizona reporters seem to paint a much different picture of mccain than the beltway reporters do
2231718 the charge lacked evidence but it still managed to knock the obama campaign off message
2231719 the status quo means mccain loses hes got to change things
2231720 i would answer back hard what do you mean hes not one of us its john mccain who wears 500 shoes has six houses and comes from one of the richest families in his state
2231721 its barack obama who climbed up the hard way and thats why he wants middle class tax cuts and better schools for our kids
2231722 the new mccain is tight and focused the candidate who once invited all comers onto the back of his bus now hangs a curtain on his campaign plane to prevent reporters from even catching a glimpse instead of charm and candor he serves up fastballs instead of risk taking he seeks control its a whole new mccain
2231723 not unlike fox news channel senator mccain is not just exploiting the ignorance of his supporters hes counting on it
2231724 edwards told abc news correspondent bob woodruff he did have an affair with 44 year old rielle hunter but said that he did not love her
2231725 i cannot recall ever seeing let alone hearing of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted
2231726 its still very hard to accept that gavins not here the plans are to make sure that this doesnt happen again
2231727 we are going down a few avenues at the moment with my lawyers its got to be started now with gavins death because its gone on too long
2231728 im really angry because hes lost his life for nothing theyve let him down theyve let me down theyve let his sister down all the family are devastated
2231729 the army does not allow or condone any form of physical activity to be used for disciplinary purposes
2231730 commanding officers are made fully aware of their responsibility to protect their soldiers from all forms of physical and mental harassment or intimidation and any suspicion of bullying is dealt with immediately
2231731 lamabilit est la gentillesse des gens qui nont pas de coeur
2231732 fo every ill rhyme put a dollar in the bank
2231733 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2231734 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2231735 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
2231736 my country is in self defense against russian aggression russian troops invaded georgia
2231737 will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished
2231738 my duty as russian president is to safeguard the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are this is what is behind the logic of the steps we are undertaking now
2231739 all of us hundreds of thousands of georgians here and abroad should come together unite and fight to save georgia we are a freedom loving people and if our nation is united no aggressor will be able to harm it
2231740 a large part of the city has been destroyed over 15 civilians have been killed several buildings are on fire in the city center and the local parliament building has burned down
2231741 street fighting in tskhinvali has lasted for many hours ossetian home guards are using grenade launchers to destroy georgian tanks eyewitnesses say tanks are burning throughout the city the turning point is approaching in the battle for the capital city
2231742 this is just a start fellas were going to get better with this
2231743 from what i gather the major objection to mccains points for blogging scheme is that people actually receive something of some monetary value in exchange for their hard work
2231744 certainly the talking points may help mccain supporters stay on message
2231745 its one thing to get a gift from your boyfriend quite another to find cash on the table the next day
2231746 i think the commenters here are in the minority in thinking that msm coverage of the election has favored mccain
2231747 mccain on the other hand is targeting two right wing blogs and the daily kos
2231748 you who writes a snotty blog for a living are calling obama volunteers smug
2231749 i think the commenters here are in the minority in thinking that msm coverage of the election has favored mccain
2231750 whereas obamas volunteers simply bask in the glow of their smug self satisfaction
2231751 theres a thread running through the way mccain treats his wife how about an apology for miss bulffalo chip if nothing else and putting cash on the table
2231752 if only she would do what i said then i wouldn t have to beat her
2231753 there are mccain supporters who arent morons why then do we never actually encounter any
2231754 keep pimping the blame america stalinist candidate lefties by pushing the white guilt card
2231755 i also dont recall either side calling the other stupid or evil as i see republicans called on a regular basis
2231756 however there are many other republicans that have little use for the religious right they are for the most part neither stupid not irrational
2231757 for the first time the idea began to take hold that john mccain can win this thing
2231758 mr obama got tagged the past month as something new not the candidate from mens vogue but arrogant aloof and somehow ethereal
2231759 the daring and exciting european trip was probably a wash and possibly a mistake in the bridge too far sense during the coverage pundits were always saying the trip leveled the playing field on foreign affairs between sens obama and mccain
2231760 however mr obama consistently shows that he doesnt know what he doesnt know its a theme with his talented confident staff they dont know what they dont know either because theyre young and theyve never been in power and it takes time to know what you dont know
2231761 i saw a fire once it spreads like syrup no it spreads like explosive syrup no its formidable and yet fleeting
2231762 it has been called many things the past 50 years
2231763 for the first time the idea began to take hold that john mccain can win this thing you saw the usa today gallup poll this week with mr mccain gaining six points since late june among those gallup dubbed likely voters mr mccain took the lead 49 to 45 among registered voters its still barack obama 47 to 44 a poll came out saying people are tired of hearing about mr obama mr mccain took the lead in youtube hits small stuff and there will be a lot of twists and turns before this is over but theres movement down there beneath the crust of the earth
2231764 is it irresponsible to speculate it is irresponsible not to
2231765 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
2231766 i saw a fire once it spreads like syrup no it spreads like explosive syrup no its formidable and yet fleeting
2231767 obamas sometimes over the top rhetoric about healing the earth and parting the seas
2231768 i think mr bush is admired and liked after three years of war terror strife and recession because people have eyes they look at him listen to him and watch him every day they can tell that george w bush is looking out for america they can tell he means it they can see his sincerity they can tell he is doing his best they understand his thinking because he tells them his thinking they think he may be right they re not sure but at least they understand his thinking
2231769 mr bush s critics say he sees things too much in black and white but he is addressing the central issues of life and death he isn t dithering or dodging and he isn t spending all his time trying to maintain his viability within the system he s calling the shots bearing the burden and taking the heat he reminds me of a man i know who was imprisoned in vietnam we went to lunch in a place with short candles on the table i was asking about the hanoi hilton a waiter walked by and bumped the table which made a candle tilt against a wicker basket full of bread the basket was lined with paper napkins which went up in flames the man didn t change his tone of voice as he continued his story quietly picked up the flaming basket placed it on the floor and softly stepped on it with his large right shoe the flames went out he continued his narrative as he eyed a waiter handed him the smoking basket and asked for more bread president bush reminds me of that guy he would not offer sensitive or witty commentary on how odd it is to be surprised by fire on a spring day but he would put the fire out mr bush has the calm and anxious face of an american man who believes in god but just read the raw threat file he knows what trouble we re in and he knows what time it is he is alert and determined but ultimately trusting and hopeful because there really is a god and he really is watching this is very american
2231770 i should have added that its refreshing to see a conservative refrain from repeating the obama is presumptuous meme and to acknowledge there was some logic behind his trip to europe and the way hes been campaigning even if you think hes made mistakes or overdone it at times
2231771 its refreshing to see a conservative refrain from repeating the obama is presumptuous meme
2231772 obamas sometimes over the top rhetoric about healing the earth and parting the seas
2231773 shes spent the post reagan trying to prove that she has some mystical power to see deeply into the soul of the american people
2231774 the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
2231775 at first it was pretty awkward and none of them seemed like they were really into it
2231776 but then the drummer comes in and right after that the bass player comes in and it was like yes soundgarden is back it was so intense
2231777 i got all the way there but then i just didnt know if i could do it
2231778 i had a huge lunch that day and cinnabon thats some really sugary stuff even if you have a sweet tooth like me
2231779 all i saw was this bare chested guy entering the store and thats unacceptable in the food service industry i hate to be the enforcer but just because we were in a band together doesnt mean i can allow him to create an unhygienic environment
2231780 oh no intel summary statistics library how to manage with oceans of information techmeme river reverse chronological techmeme wesmirch celeb gossip
2231781 casy is right never ever talk to a cop you dont have to they will twist what you say into what they need to hear everytime
2231782 the hectic but repetitive routine of presidential campaigns often seems to consist entirely of back and forth charges between candidates punctuated by photo ops debates and the occasional policy speech followed by another barrage of accusations and counter accusations formulated into the soundbites preferred by cable news producers it is a little hypocritical for candidates or reporters to criticize these deficiencies they are our creation campaigns and the media collaborated as architects of the modern presidential campaign and we deserve equal blame for the regret we feel from time to time over its less than inspirational features voters however even in this revolutionary communications age with its 24 hour news cycle can be forgiven their uncertainty about what the candidates actually hope to achieve if they have the extraordinary privilege of being elected president of the united states we spend too little time and offer too few specifics on that most important of questions we make promises of course about what kind of policies we would pursue in office but they often are obscured mischaracterized and forgotten in the heat and fog of political battle
2231783 mccain sometimes sounds as if hell produce enough wind to power the nation all by himself
2231784 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbash as outlined in mr suskinds book
2231785 russias just invaded georgia good times to be had by all
2231786 how about wondering if ron paul yes that one is over it there is more than a small chance that he and his true believers will cause more problems for mccain than the clintons for obama who much to the medias sadness seem to be working things through
2231787 russias invasion of georgia is the pearl harbor of the 21st century savannah lies in ruins paratroop drops are reported in macon and milledgeville the warsaw pact nations have been alerted that georgia omfg somebody turn this thing off
2231788 they are the worst kind of back stabbing lying hypocrites because they are potentially working privately to undermine obamas chances
2231789 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
2231790 clintons still personally upset with obama campaigns hardball tactics not fully invested in obama victory privately suggest he will fail as predicted despite repeated public vows of support

2231794 georgian forces are controlling the entire territory of south ossetia except java
2231795 this information will be checked but this is the approximate number based on information from relatives
2231796 we are a freedom loving nation right now under attack
2231797 we urge all the parties including georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate and avoid conflict
2231798 we are working on mediation efforts to secure a ceasefire
2231799 ambulances cannot move hospitals are reported to be overflowing surgery is taking place in corridors
2231800 if this is not war then i wonder what is
2231801 there is a threat of even more large scale russian aggression against georgia georgia faces an existential threat amid russian aggression
2231802 they have in effect begun hostilities using tanks and artillery
2231803 there should be only one ossetia we want to live with our brothers
2231804 now we see georgia has found a use for these weapons and for the special forces that were trained with the help of international instructors
2231805 the number of refugees is growing a humanitarian crisis is looming
2231806 the commonwealth isnt so big this is the world were competing against the biggest of the big
2231807 this was my main goal if you reach this you know youve really done well and i have
2231808 i was out due to broken wrists and ankles it was tough but i got here
2231809 googles soc is a formal sponsorship program tailored specifically to open source
2231810 my primary role has changed from developing drupal web sites myself to consulting with large clients such as mtv sony bmg records bbc and popular science magazine that use drupal my job is to help train their developers help architect web sites mapping wireframes to drupal functionality and to impart best practices and advice that ive picked up from working in the drupal community over the past three years lullabot also gives us time built into our working schedule to work on drupal itself
2231811 an internship is a nice opportunity for both an employer and an employee to size each other up to see if theyd be a good match and real world experience will always trump anything you read in a book
2231812 ive been mostly self taught but i went to school to help fill in some of the gaps
2231813 one of my instructors ian macleod mentioned gsoc it sounded like a wonderful opportunity to me id had a love of open source basically since i first heard the term in the late 90s but i had always lacked the confidence to believe that i could be part of it to be able to get my foot in the door and to be paid to do it at the same time was basically a dream opportunity so i applied figuring what the heck
2231814 someone reading about gsoc might come away thinking the sole goal of the program is for open source organizations to use googles money to pay students to work on much neglected or much needed features
2231815 what a sweet deal however i believe gsoc is more about attracting and retaining talent to an open source project than it is about producing fantastic code
2231816 i would much rather have only semi fantastic code from a student who stays on with the project long term and gets involved in other aspects such as documentation and core development than a 100 working thing of beauty from a student who we never hear from again after gsoc is finished
2231817 students work on something fun that they enjoy and get paid to do it
2231818 it greatly lowers the barrier of entry to getting involved in an open source project
2231819 and if they cant help you they know someone else who can
2231820 its a great way to bug test your documentation to see if its easy for new people to get up to speed
2231821 potentially long term contributors get completely immersed and start taking on additional roles in the project since open source projects thrive on contributors the opportunity to obtain more of them is a huge benefit
2231822 working in open source effectively gives you an open resume
2231823 instead of taking you at your word your employer can actually look at your code and see its progression from when you first started on a project until now they can view your interactions with fellow community members and see how you can effectively solve problems in a team environment you demonstrate your ability to use collaboration tools necessary for serious software development
2231824 this program served to completely shatter the myths i had about how open source projects worked i thought everyone who works on open source is this enormous genius with a huge brain and is some sort of god of programming which paralyzed me from getting involved in open source for nearly 10 years
2231825 everyone contributes what they can whether its a starter solution a fantastic algorithm thatll blow your mind a confirmation that the change works on internet explorer 6 under windows xp or documentation that has proper grammar and sentence structure
2231826 suddenly i was collaborating with people in hungary germany and the united states
2231827 instead of smashing your face on the problem for three days mentors are available who will answer your question in five minutes realizing that its perfectly ok to ask questions and in fact encouraged was one of the hurdles i had to get over students also have the tendency to avoid committing projects until theyre so clean and shiny you can eat off them when i finally learned to commit early commit often i had fewer headaches and a lot more help
2231828 i chose to apply for the quiz module which allows people to use drupal to build web based quizzes and tally the results
2231829 one of the people i did contract work for was kieran lal who was with a drupal company called civicspace labs he had seen me actively participating in the drupal community and paid me to drive a couple of patches home and to write some gnarly technical documentation about the new form api that had just been added to drupal after this kind of test drive he ended up hiring me to work full time and that became my first drupal job in november 2005 three months after completing gsoc
2231830 last year i helped manage drupals participation in the google highly open participation contest which was a gsoc like program but for 13 to 18 year old students with a focus on short term tasks rather than two month long projects
2231831 berry was a ghop student who increased drupals automated test coverage by many orders of magnitude and is now working on the usability testing suite which will allow field testing of proposed user interface changes in order to get immediate feedback from users novak is a three time gsocer with drupal who is passionate about re tooling drupals feed aggregation system
2231832 lenders gsoc project was around an automated testing framework for drupal and he was hired by nowpublic a citizen journalism web site powered by drupal to help manage internal testing procedures several of our students have gone onto jobs within drupal shops and one at google itself
2231833 people often get jobs at companies like red hat with no previous relationship to the company however interning certainly can assist in opening doors and building relationships that lead to full time employment
2231834 there are related roles in engineering sales and marketing positions like these are available at red hat and candidates can review our careers site to find more information
2231835 this is often facilitated by the close relationship that red hat maintains with the
2231836 at red hat our new hires must have the basic skills we require to perform the job so while we dont offer on the job training we do offer opportunities to enhance core skills with additional training for example with our associate technical support engineer role new hires participate in six weeks of in house training and then sit for their red hat certified engineer certification which is paid for by red hat
2231837 we red hat have a three month intern program where interns work for specific departments and participate in cross functional projects the internship program delivers a robust exposure to open source
2231838 beyond that as a growing company and a leader in the open source community we look for entry level employees who can demonstrate an ability to scale with red hat
2231839 with regard to specific technical skills experience with linux up stream work java c c perl and python are big pluses
2231840 one approach for this is to seek additional education or certifications that are in high demand in the marketplace for people focused on an open source career a rhce certification could be a good opportunity
2231841 in the web 2 0 world building a strong network is critical to managing your career utilizing tools such as linkedin facebook and plaxo to build your professional network early in your college career is an important first step
2231842 also try to seek out skill enhancement opportunities that are aligned to your career goals
2231843 there seems to have been more or less a straight fight between the states and us as to who actually plunges into a recession first
2231844 anyone who has been keeping an eye on spains troubled economy wont be too surprised to see that the eurozone is really struggling
2231845 a momentous economic slowdown in spain is now under way though just in the beginning stages with the bulk of the pain to be suffered in 2009
2231846 the probability of a crisis scenario similar to the early 1990s is increasing
2231847 the economic situation is worse than we all predicted we thought it would happen slowly but it has hit fast
2231848 the euros 25 to 30 overvaluation against the us dollar
2231849 since 1911 there existed in england a system of unemployment insurance that gave an indemnity to jobless workers known as the
2231850 no religion spread as fast as the belief in full employment
2231851 and in this roundabout way allowed governments that had exhausted their tax and borrowing resources to ressort to the phony delights of monetary inflation
2231852 they did a great job it was an unbelievable experience
2231853 my own personal highlight was right before the ceremony when we met the president it was real quick he kind of made his rounds and met everybody on the u s team all of the u s athletes got to mingle around that was nice
2231854 when they lit the torch of course that was amazing to me
2231855 when it went all the way around to light the torch and when it caught fire my body went numb
2231856 i was in awe tonight when we walked through those tunnels its real bright in the tunnels then it gets a little dark and then suddenly it opens up and just to see 90 000 people in the audience and the roar they had going already amazing
2231857 that many athletes in the olympics to be with the likes of kobe bryant lebron james who brought up the rear for the u s team in the entrance parade and jennie finch those are amazing athletes
2231858 the lighting of the torch was pretty sweet to see
2231859 i told my family you guys have to tape this thing its gonna be awesome i wanted to take pictures but right as soon as were got into the tunnel my camera messed up
2231860 when we came through the tunnel you just see this huge stadium all these people staring at you cheering lights all the athletes are chanting usa
2231861 i got a little emotional thinking about family members thatll be watching it later
2231862 being there being away from the family and knowing theyll be watching got to me a little bit the way they put up the olympic flag was emotional and it was really awesome when china came in to hear the crowd support
2231863 we stuck together we walked out together then we got together once in the infield but after that its all for one
2231864 the bus afterwards that was awesome i was trying to learn chinese there was a french guy there trying to speak our language it was pretty cool the bus probably held 45 to 50 people and we had over 85 people on our bus the little girl who worked for the company was freaking out
2231865 were all very excited to get in the competition and play instead of just scrimmaging china or ourselves
2231866 we have intrasquad then china a couple times before actual games were kind of ready to go weve got the itch a little bit to see what were going to do
2231867 weve had a lot of consecutive days of working out
2231868 it will be good to get our feet under us and get this thing going
2231869 like a rubber ball ill come bouncing back to you
2231870 the trend with young adults is that theyll get a 10 000 ring and a few years later theyll want it to be larger
2231871 its a way of showing their appreciation for the longevity of the relationship

2231873 scotts extensive experience in software and implementation has made the relaunch of the viva website a smooth transition
2231874 im confident that scott will help us continue to ramp up our it capabilities as we move toward our first broadcasts
2231875 one of scotts main goals is to ensure that the new launch of our viva site will give more information to our shareholders and the investment community
2231876 regrettably it is clear that frankie will not make his weight before tomorrow mornings weigh in
2231877 frankie has been working his whole boxing career towards the olympic games and he is obviously completely devastated
2231878 in the end there was nothing left to come off and at that stage i took the responsibility of withdrawing him
2231879 i didnt want frankie to suffer any ill effects to his health from being that dehydrated
2231880 theres that many people nutritionists physiotherapists involved these days that are paid good money
2231881 its been a total let down by everyone making the weight is just not an issue you make the weight
2231882 he was determined to go ahead and give it his best shot which i think he did
2231883 that determination and attitude shows that in my opinion frankie hasnt failed i think he is a tremendous talent and he will come back from this
2231884 it was my decision frankie did everything i asked him to do and maybe a little bit more and in the end i decided he had done enough and i called it a day
2231885 for the first time in his life he has been training like a professional not an amateur and he has been getting bigger as a result and fighting a running battle with his weight
2231886 at the olympics the boxers have to make the weight every day they box
2231887 even if he had made the first weigh in he might have struggled afterwards dehydration might have become a real problem
2231888 its important now that the attention is shifted to the remaining seven boxers who all have a fantastic chance to medal
2231889 thats what frankie wants and hell be watching avidly on the television despite how upset he is right now
2231890 if youre going to fight in an amateur tournament youve got to train in the amateur way
2231891 if you train regular as a pro youre body will change and the weight gain will happen
2231892 someones head has got to roll because of the amount of money that has been put into this fighter
2231893 frankie has to take a lot of responsibility if he knew he couldnt make the weight he should have said ages ago and not gone there and wasted the taxpayers money
2231894 but the overall responsibility has to go down to the head coach the man at the top has to pay the price
2231895 it is always regretful when an athlete who has qualified for the olympic games is unable to compete
2231896 this is an exciting development and one that addresses important e discovery challenges facing todays forensics professionals including processing speed and cost
2231897 the upcoming line of perlustro products which have integrated a newly designed platform of passware advanced decryption tools will provide forensically sound access to data and will do so more quickly and less expensively than competing technologies
2231898 working with passwares team we were able to create a cost effective solution that will dramatically increase the speed of every aspect of digital investigations
2231899 by combining perlustros revolutionary forensics toolset with the passware tools and with microsofts sql server 64 which is a critical component of perlustros ilook toolbase we created a truly winning combination and one that were excited to share with the government and commercial forensics community
2231900 members of the apache nation extend a gracious gesture of solidarity with all indigenous peoples in inviting our earth family to join in prayer for a blue sky opening ceremonies in beijing on 8 8 08

2231910 while blu ray discs bd offering both 25gb and 50gb are sufficient for users current demands we envision the need for a technology that can support far greater capacities as hd streaming in particular becomes commonplace and users build larger files of digital content
2231911 the multi layered method is compatible with blu ray devices providing a long term future for the technology and is more easily produced when compared to competing technologies such as holographic storage
2231912 this is an indictment for failure to disclose gifts that are controversial in terms of whether they were or were not gifts its not bribery its not some corruption its not some extreme felony

2231919 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2231920 i actually walked the country to see who i am who i really am but i dont know what the result of that will be
2231921 but for me personally id rather be successful or unsuccessful based on who i really am not based on some plastic ken doll that you put up in front of audiences thats not me you know
2231922 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false

2231931 as soon as possible as far as we are concerned
2231932 u s presidential candidate barack obama is right when he talks about 16 months
2231933 he refuses to credit gen petraeus and gen odierno for their leadership he disparages their strategic judgment and trumpets his own
2231934 what is sen obamas judgment based on his tenure at the senate foreign relations committee when he did not hold a single substantive hearing his years in the illinois state senate or as a community organizer or is it based on his international experience gleaned while he was in junior high school in indonesia or on a college spring break trip in pakistan or is it based on the memos and briefing papers from his 300 foreign policy advisers
2231935 is that sen obamas judgment on the most important national security questions facing our country in 2007 was wrong and it demonstrates both his inexperience and his ideological rigidity
2231936 i note that he is speaking today about his plans for iraq and afghanistan before he has even left before he has talked to gen david petraeus before he has seen the progress in iraq and before he has set foot in afghanistan for the first time
2231937 i see a joke in here somewhere like what do you get when you clone a booger
2231938 what about the rest the parts of the universe beyond our

2231953 ideea ca daca pdl nu are candidati de teapa lui piedone nu o sa castige alegerile este o mare eroare

2231958 over the past nine years the ccp has used a variety of inaccurate labels on falun gong
2231959 in each case the aim has been to vilify people who practice falun gong and therefore justify the horrors these people are subject to under ccp rule
2231960 there exists sadly a real possibility that the ccp would attempt to stage or attribute a disruptive act perhaps even one involving violence with the intent to pin it on falun gong
2231961 the people location time and story in that report were all fabricated there did not exist a lady named zhi wen zhang at all
2231962 anyone who participates in an organized act of violence in the name of falun gong is by the very act itself not a and certainly does not represent the community of falun gong practitioners
2231963 in all our efforts to regain our basic freedoms over the past nine years we have never engaged in acts that intentionally harm innocent people

2231996 in 2003 a parking adjudicator told the council that we should make changes to the yellow lines and the enforcement in this area of montague hill south and allow some appeals against parking tickets
2231997 at the time she said the yellow lines were misleading and we shouldnt be enforcing
2231998 he has told you o man what is good and what does the lord require of you but to do justice and to love kindness and to walk humbly with your god
2231999 how can you believe in the lord jesus christ and show such blatant partiality on the basis of wealth and social status
2232000 god must love the common people because he made so many of them
2232001 the law tells me to love my neighbor as myself therefore we are duty bound to welcome this man when he comes to church
2232002 if you are really welcoming the man because you love him as you do yourself and you wish to give him the welcome you yourself would wish to receive that is fine but if you are giving him this special welcome because he is rich that is favoritism and that is wrong and far from keeping the law you are in fact breaking it you dont love your neighbor or you would not neglect the poor man what you love is wealth and that is not what the law commands
2232003 where does this christianity now exist where do the christians live where can we find a place in which the inhabitants are all filled with the holy spirit where are those who have one heart and mind and see that no one lacks anything and continuously give to anyone in need is there a place where all the people have gods love filling their hearts and causing them to love their neighbors as themselves where are those who have clothed themselves with compassion kindness humility meekness and patience who are those that do not in any way violate justice mercy or truth either by word or deed rather at every point they do to others as they would have them do in return can we properly term any territory a christian country if it does not conform to this description in that case let us confess that we have never yet seen a christian country upon the earth
2232004 the school is being built on raised land which is above the 1 000 year flood warning plus 20 so it wont flood
2232005 weve spent 3 5m and four years developing this project
2232006 weve got vast support the only people that are blocking it as far was we can see are the environment agency
2232007 they wont talk to us we dont know what a planning inquiry on this is going to achieve when the environment agency are the only ones blocking us
2232008 we are disappointed with the comments made by mr dyson following the decision by the government to call in the planning application for the south quays development particularly since this is an integral part of the democratic process
2232009 the agency has been working with mr dysons agents for more than two years and have had numerous face to face meetings

2232014 development studies and gold farming have so far had nothing to say to one another
2232015 processes found in chronologies of capitalist development and the product life cycle
2232016 the rather wobbly legged best guesses for 2008 are that 400 000 gold farmers earning an average us 145 per month produced a global market worth us 500 million but we could easily more than double the latter to over us 1 billion there are probably 5 10 million consumers of gold farming services
2232017 everything you ever wanted to known about gold farming as seen through the multi faceted prism of economic and sociological analysis

2232024 the video is honestly the best thing ive ever done
2232025 the whole thing is eight parts so you can see every single stage of the song and video coming together along with work logs and lyrics and lots more its the first time i got to go this deep into everything i stand for
2232026 then their eyes would cross as soon as wed start talking about it and theyd start talking about web isodes
2232027 editing is cool was perfect conceptually because i got to get my philosophy about process in there
2232028 i used to always be creating for someone else and that was great but writing music and seeing someone elses visuals attached to it is totally disjointed for me what im doing now in whatever medium linear non linear virtual physical i can execute on all those different planes and thats what i always wanted to do
2232029 i went to my high school mumford high for the first time in 43 years
2232030 i thought i was going to give a 10 minute speech and they surprised me with allis willis day

2232035 it was like watching a field of poppies grow in six weeks the students applications collectively got 16 million installations then it was 25 million we stopped keeping track
2232036 some of the most viral apps from our class had a clear life cycle
2232037 once the novelty wore off they werent so fun anymore so students would create another app learning to transfer users from a dying app to a rising app became a skill we want to learn more about this so were starting to look at the psychology of persuasive designs and what metrics you can use to measure it i want to be able to teach how to use psychology to make good decisions about what you want to persuade people to do measure whats working and be able to iterate quickly based on how they respond
2232038 he took three calls from the office just during lunch about the metrics that day
2232039 he told me that they change their ads on a daily basis
2232040 what were doing is identifying antecedents to peace like empathy and tolerance that most people would agree need to be present in a peaceful society then were designing measurable persuasive techniques to achieve them
2232041 our surveys of users before and after showed that peoples empathy and tolerance levels changed measurably
2232042 people who answered four questions in the game felt different from people who didnt answer the questions
2232043 they did not challenge it very much and it therefore turned out to be quite a simple fraud to conduct

2232067 coming from a generation where technology infiltrates so many aspects of our lives its really nice to see that enthusiasm for reading is still alive and well
2232068 i cant believe how many friends i have made just through this series
2232069 not to mention the friends i already had and converted to loving meyers books
2232070 its nice to know there are so many fans as dedicated to meyers clean creative and addictive treasures
2232071 aufgrund der verletzungssorgen unserer innenverteidigung haben wir schnell reagiert und sind sehr froh dass wir einen spieler verpflichten konnten der so viel erst und zweitligaerfahrung mitbringt
2232072 mir gef llt die philosophie von j rgen klinsmann zun chst einmal die st rke des vorhandenden kaders auszureizen und jeden spieler individuell zu verbessern philipp lahm und bastian schweinsteiger k nnen beispielsweise schon seit f nf jahren mit links keine flanke schlagen obwohl sie auf der linken seite spielen da anzusetzen ist der richtige weg
2232073 man darf nicht vergessen dass wir in den vergangenen jahren einen finanziellen aufwand betrieben haben den man nicht jedes jahr wiederholen kann
2232074 nat rlich wird der druck entsprechend hoch sein aber als profi muss man dem standhalten
2232075 wir haben einen solchen spieler auch verpflichtet damit der fc wieder in dimensionen vorst t in die wir kommen wollen
2232076 ive been answering questions about you hank your one little fade pattern has gone over real big in philadelphia youre not running any more of those fade patterns again
2232077 if youve got to dig that deep to bring up something bad about me that shows a lot about me
2232078 im gonna have a lot of fun out there coming out and starting with the no 1 unit im gonna try and showcase my talent and let the coaches know im ready
2232079 i will just go out there and do what i do work on my fundamentals what my coach taught me go over plays and show them what i got
2232080 it was a tragic case and i think ive now got a good understanding of what transpired
2232081 the case has raised a number of very fundamental issues relating to patient privacy and the circumstances when that ought to be breached
2232082 eating home cooked meals from whole in season ingredients obtained from the most local source available is eating well in every sense good for the habitat good for the body
2232083 better food more local more healhty more sensible is a powerful new topic of the american conversation
2232084 the farmers markets are so affordable that i cant really justify planting a large garden
2232085 even though what the kingsolvers did was drastic just to make some small changes in our lives would make a difference
2232086 i didnt realize how much gardening and eating overlap each other
2232087 i mean im not willing to not ever eat an orange because it doesnt grow in our climate
2232088 i dont think our parents ever thought so much about what we ate
2232089 our children are eating way more processed foods than we ever did even though the idea of only eating home or locally grown items seems highly unrealistic i appreciate kingsolvers enthusiasm for eating local
2232090 we were very conscious this year to plant things that we all will eat
2232091 my kids love the cucumbers i was amazed my kids pick them and eat them right off the vine because they taste so much better than store bought

2232094 the underpinnings of it were always the technology applications that government was buying and thats pretty much what we have left
2232095 whereas ab 2747 mandates that a physician discuss the cost and burden of medial treatment with
2232096 we screwed up our handicapping in the console wars and are working like hell to catch up given the wild and unexpected success of the wii remember guys we bought that studio in utah specifically devoted to developing games for the wii we are keeping up the pressure to catch up with ubisoft and hey while we missed the boat early we are getting on now after all we are ea
2232097 man that ps3 has screwed the pooch and is killing us can you believe nobody in japan wants it we have 25 titles lined up thankfully they can be dual purposed for ps3 and xbox 360 since development costs are a fortune and ps3 is a disappointment at least microsoft has this gaming thing going ok im only saying i think ps3 can do 6 7 million units because of the goodwill i need to preserve with sony given the massive installed base of ps2 users
2232098 there could be a price cut for the ps3 by the end of the year and more software titles will hit the market i expect the ps3 to be doing better after a while
2232099 of course the wii will keep running ahead all the while
2232100 yeah weve got 25 titles going for the ps3 and xbox 360 were amortizing development costs over both platforms no more exclusives for sony if ps3 craps out well quickly shift resources we still rock at development and still have a chance to come up with some unique games for the wii that give us a competitive advantage relative to both ubisoft and nintendos in house studio developement for the wii is much cheaper its less risky and we have to do it
2232101 i know what im going to do deny theres a problem
2232102 wii could be considered an impulse buy more than anything else
2232103 thq has always avoided direct competition with top publishers by going after a niche and with wii they have found success
2232104 we are very bullish on the wii and the ds and we think that our product lineup maps very well to both those platforms
2232105 i think you should think of the wii as incrementally more positive to us than the ps3
2232106 we are redirecting some other resources toward wii and the ds
2232107 by the end of this fiscal year we will have six titles in the market which other than ubisoft will make us the most prolific publisher on the wii platform through march
2232108 you have to look at the wii as a new platform so you cant just port stuff from the ps3 to the xbox 360 to the wii though thats the ea way
2232109 companies that do differentiate between the platforms will have the edge because they can write for the platform
2232110 it was a little slow in may but once the schools let out in june
2232111 ive been pleased and surprised and i didnt hold out high hopes
2232112 to be honest i did not anticipate a great summer
2232113 we sell the things you want not necessarily the things you need
2232114 most of our guests are from new england or are canadians
2232115 once they get their heating bills well vacations and going out to dinner are the first things to go
2232116 the hotel owners are telling me that reservations look good for the fall
2232117 but i worry about oil prices people getting their bills and looking at them this time of year
2232118 in the fall we get a lot of european customers
2232119 they usually have no children or their children are grown and they have more money to spend
2232120 our hotels are full our stores are busy and its hard getting a dinner reservation around here
2232121 for july 4th we had a beautiful weather weekend and some businesses had their best weekend ever
2232122 some businesses are down but a lot more are holding their own and doing better than anticipated
2232123 faced with a weak economy and increasing energy costs many mainers are having a tough time making ends meet
2232124 the purpose of these rebate checks was to get people to spend more money and when they spend their payments here in maine that will help our local economy
2232125 most of these people are seniors who are not required to file for any reason other than to get their stimulus payment so they may not realize they qualify and because they may not have filed a tax return in decades they may find the process intimidating
2232126 we need to get the word out that people have until oct 15 to claim the payment and that they can get help in applying
2232127 many of the seniors who havent filed yet are home bound and may need special assistance
2232128 family members and friends should check in with the seniors they know to make sure theyre aware they can qualify for the payment and get the help they need
2232129 i think norman rockwell resonates with the american public far more than a lot of artists do
2232130 he painted a broad stroke across the american nostalgic theme everyone still looks back and talks about how wonderful that world is
2232131 people have come up to us and have told us stories about how they knew norman rockwell he has touched a lot of lives
2232132 one day i got a call from a lady in ohio saying im booking a flight if you can promise me two tickets
2232133 happily ive always loved his stuff just about everything he painted had a story to it
2232134 im hoping that the public has as much fun at it as weve had creating it
2232135 take back the tap why choosing tap water over bottled water is better for your health your pocketbook and the environment

2232152 a lot of my ability came from my high school coach linda boudette at saugus
2232153 if you look at my stats i didnt have a lot of points i was more defensive minded
2232154 i was not the most skilled player but i had desire and my coach brought that out i want to bring that out in my players and i want to see the girls have as much fun with it as i did
2232155 this is a wonderful opportunity for people in the community to come out and enjoy a fun evening with the smmc family auxiliary and their friends while supporting a worthy cause

2232158 i just saw this thing in the water like a polythene bag
2232159 i thought it looked like a portuguese man of war i havent seen one of those in the cove since i was about 14
2232160 i remember when i was at school there were so many of them about we actually had them in science lessons floating in tanks
2232161 i did that mainly to ensure it could not sting anybody
2232162 its not completely unheard of for them to appear at this time of year we usually get one or two
2232163 they usually stay out in warmer deeper water but can get blown this way by southwesterly winds
2232164 notwithstanding its affirmative obligation to cooperate in reintegration efforts canada the first country to ratify the child soldier protocol and leader in international efforts to protect children involved in armed conflict has done nothing except hide behind vague assurances that omar is being treated
2232165 it is time for prime minister harper to stand up for the rights of a canadian citizen
2232166 after the second round of interviews i would hope to be able to make a job offer and negotiate the terms of employment
2232167 youll collect very little on your claim you wont have any insurance on what remains the value of your property will plummet and your mortgage company will most likely foreclose
2232168 we should not be beholden to the french for parts and maintenance for the defense of our nation
2232169 and we should not require our military personnel to learn to speak french to be able to operate our refueling tankers
2232170 when i first met with them they were excited to be part of the norman rockwell weekend because of their affinity to rockwells 1936 painting of a barbershop quartet
2232171 i didnt know at the time was how dedicated to their craft they were and what perfectionists they were
2232172 that was quite a day traffic came to a complete halt in dock square as everyone took pictures while we did our photo shoot they harmonized and entertained everyone with their antics
2232173 when we went to downtown kennebunk to shoot photos there they walked around and sang at some of the local businesses the daily scoops customers were in for a treat because they had entertainment as they enjoyed their lunches that afternoon tourists visiting asked if this happened all the time in this quaint little small town
2232174 last year as 10 year olds these kids finished the season as state runner ups
2232175 even though we finished in the same position this year i thought the contrast in the level of play from last year to this year was not even close despite the fact that 10 of the 13 kids returned from last years team
2232176 next year all of the players will be eligible for the williamsport team
2232177 the competition will be tougher however i think the experience that these kids have gained over the past two seasons will contribute greatly to the teams success next year
2232178 i want to thank all of the parents and fans for their tremendous support they have provided us since the start of practices back on june 22nd
2232179 i am so good that i dont play by the rules
2232180 if youre really great at something everyone will look the other way when you act like a jerk

2232185 a survey of the literature reveals that discretion to award punitive damages has not mass produced runaway awards

2232189 temple has one of the best womens fencing teams in the nation
2232190 theyre coached by nikki franke a two time olympian ive thought about the olympics of course i love fencing and have such a fun time doing it if that takes me to the olympics id love to go but thats not why i fence
2232191 ive met so many amazing people and learned so much that translates out of the sport and into everyday life
2232192 its a part of my life i dont think will go away any time in the future i want to see what happens and see how college fencing goes
2232193 right now i have no plans except to enjoy myself and learn
2232194 santa called on the phone i told him i wanted fencing lessons he said i was too young and it was too dangerous i cried to my parents
2232195 nobody i knew fenced i never saw it on tv i have no idea why i wanted them but when i was 9 i got lessons
2232196 out of all the races i have ever done this one was the nicest
2232197 the campaign has decided to seek federal judicial review of a decision that has troubling near term and long term ramifications for the constitutional rights of maine citizens
2232198 the maine law court has construed and applied maine law in a manner that not only tramples upon the federal constitutional rights of mr hoffman but also on the rights of the thousands of maine voters who validly signed his petitions and the rights of other members of the electorate who seek to engage in political expression or association through the nomination of non party candidates to federal or state office
2232199 places strict limits on the nature and extent of permissible regulation of ballot access by the states particularly in the context of state regulation of federal elections
2232200 its the nature of what makes great players great they always want the next challenge and its hard to find that next thing thats going to give you that excitement and that adrenaline thats what were seeing a little bit here
2232201 an estimated 2 billion people are expected to watch the games on television in a variety of screen sizes
2232202 there are excellent justifications for protests against china however there are excellent reasons to let china have her moment of olympic glory
2232203 well that seems to cover everything except how the sporting events will actually go we were looking for a forecast from a diehard sports blog but the only site that seems to be on the record with
2232204 its so dark there are the stars the armadillos and the skunks
2232205 its the best thing that has ever happened to me

2232209 well sort of one okay im sort of with this guy but i like this other guy dont know much about the new one but the other one ive known for years
2232210 an evening of norman rockwells famous saturday evening post illustrations
2232211 after several years of relatively flat achievement scores we are beginning to see a positive trend
2232212 schools now have three years of grade level data for grades 3 through 8 to inform the development of their programs over time
2232213 the meas are not about trying to show how well we are doing
2232214 they are a tool to help us assess how we are doing for better or worse we are working to assess why the results were inconsistent and how we can adjust the assessment in the future so that we can use it yearly to assess progress in writing
2232215 youre keeping the food local and it ripples back through the economy
2232216 the benefits are you get great food its fresh it tastes great and at this time of year you get a tremendous variety
2232217 i felt like we were on sacred grounds and that we somehow shouldnt have been there
2232218 im not forwarding this because of the chain letter threat that my hair will fall out my first born will be a hermaphrodite and my armpits will be infested by a thousand fleas im forwarding it because this is sound advice and these are words to live by
2232219 a week long protest to keep the spotlight on the people of darfur during the beijing games
2232220 he cared about me first and the job second i have great respect for him
2232221 he always took the time to help us through our problems and work towards making things better he always listened
2232222 pat myers and i were best friends in high school and still are
2232223 pat and i talk two to three times a week nick who just took over at ohio state has been instrumental in me getting into coaching and i talk with him weekly i was in his wedding two summers ago if that helps to define how close we all are its nuts that three guys from little kennebunk have all made it to this level of division i athletics go figure
2232224 so much credit is owed to our high school coaches mine specifically being joe rafferty for football don hill and dustin black for hockey and charlie burch for lacrosse its very rare to see kids from one town who have experiences under these coaches to make it to the intercollegiate coaching level and there are a bunch more other than the myers brothers and myself it goes to show how good of a job they do preparing the student athletes for the next level and that is tough to come by these days which i have learned the past few years in the recruiting process they deserve a lot of credit for that and kennebunk is fortunate to have great coaches across the board in most sports
2232225 as for new hampshire we wanted to return open wheel racing to the new england market
2232226 with the substantial upgrades weve planned for that track and the opportunity for the irl to get a footprint in a top 10 market such as boston we thought the time was right for new englanders to again enjoy indycar as well as nascar however the irl made it clear that new hampshire was not in its business plans moving forward
2232227 im extremely disappointed for our fans who have given us very positive feedback about the possible return of indycar racing to new hampshire motor speedway
2232228 in fact in a recent poll on our web site nhms com nearly 80 percent of our fans said they wanted to see this exciting form of motorsports return thats a strong endorsement and i dont understand the decision not to include our facility on next years schedule
2232229 i think its a slap in the face to bruton smith our chairman and to our company who have both been very supportive of the indy racing league since its inception from a historical perspective bob bahre the former owner of new hampshire motor speedway was one of the first to agree to go with the indy racing league irl when they split from championship auto racing teams cart in 1995
2232230 its two hours of really wonderful skill and of sophisticated youth performers really having a good time with what they are great at
2232231 if people think youth circus and they are unsure they should definitely be sure because they put out a ton of energy and put on something really amazing its hard to describe the show because part of me doesnt want to give it away
2232232 its basically if dr seuss wrote a science themed book
2232233 its a bizarre science done through great skill and its had many people leave the tent just buzzing
2232234 one of the really wonderful things for us is that they are a nonprofit but that they do these shows so that other organizations can raise money too
2232235 when the individual was asked he did admit that he had a weapon on him
2232236 at that point it heightens the awareness of those on the checkpoint both police and secret service
2232237 there was at least enough probable cause to stop him as well as a need to talk to this individual
2232238 the antitrust law your honor does not require this court to impose an unnecessary death sentence on a couple of innocent patients at prince william hospital each year just to shave a couple of bucks off the regions health insurance premiums
2232239 i sort of feel like great britain after the collapse of france
2232240 we must get married right away i cant risk losing you
2232241 be patient do not panic plan your future with confidence
2232242 it may be summertime in maine but winter is on the mind of many maine people
2232243 it is time we begin working together to do what we can before the temperature drops
2232244 i know we are in serious trouble this winter especially for the elderly we have to do something to help these people out
2232245 i am hearing the concerns throughout the district and i am going to do everything in my capacity as state senator to work for solutions and relief
2232246 at the beginning of this summer we set an artificial deadline to get the plan to the state by aug 15 knowing full well that we may or may not get there by that time but we at least needed a door to walk through
2232247 as long as the selectmen are talking and moving forward then im convinced the plan will move forward
2232248 this is a critical issue for us as the rsu 57 committee
2232249 we need to sit back and see what is in the best interest of all the communities
2232250 as long as bush has been here theres been a reason to march
2232251 were all politically active in this area if there is a just cause that we believe in then were there
2232252 when the president moves from one place to another or if he is out on the property or if there is a general security concern then the police adjust for that situation possibly by creating roadblocks with detours
2232253 this is the first time weve been here for this for a laidback kind of town its pretty interesting that a president lives here
2232254 the program has been under wraps for six months but with the attention to mobile device security new mobile devices and considering how companies are trying to save money on energy lately we felt it was time to announce the initiative
2232255 companies need to ask will it be productive does it really add value to our bottom line
2232256 it was a little slow in may but once the schools let out in june
2232257 ive been pleased and surprised and i didnt hold out high hopes
2232258 to be honest i did not anticipate a great summer
2232259 we sell the things you want not necessarily the things you need
2232260 most of our guests are from new england or are canadians
2232261 once they get their heating bills well vacations and going out to dinner are the first things to go
2232262 the hotel owners are telling me that reservations look good for the fall
2232263 but i worry about oil prices people getting their bills and looking at them this time of year
2232264 in the fall we get a lot of european customers
2232265 they usually have no children or their children are grown and they have more money to spend
2232266 our hotels are full our stores are busy and its hard getting a dinner reservation around here
2232267 for july 4th we had a beautiful weather weekend and some businesses had their best weekend ever
2232268 some businesses are down but a lot more are holding their own and doing better than anticipated
2232269 you can find yourself saying im getting tired of looking at all death records so you change to another type of record
2232270 some of the records we have we got by mistake whether its from another town or another state
2232271 and part of the oath is that he wont divulge that information because the town wouldnt have that information anyway
2232272 you look in the documents and many times there is information in these books that families were required to report but they didnt want the world to find out
2232273 some records he had trouble reading so someone else had to take oath and help him to read the script writing
2232274 i dont quite know how many hours he put into this project but it has to be hundreds and hundreds of hours
2232275 i think i saw a moose walking into teds backyard
2232276 we think the ymca does an outstanding job with their programs to benefit the northern york county community after hearing about the dinner ed and i thought we could help out with the dessert for their fun afternoon by giving what we make best ice cream
2232277 the campaign has decided to seek federal judicial review of a decision that has troubling near term and long term ramifications for the constitutional rights of maine citizens
2232278 the maine law court has construed and applied maine law in a manner that not only tramples upon the federal constitutional rights of mr hoffman but also on the rights of the thousands of maine voters who validly signed his petitions and the rights of other members of the electorate who seek to engage in political expression or association through the nomination of non party candidates to federal or state office
2232279 we hope to not only continue but expand the efforts in the future
2232280 we believe that with your help this will be possible the tournament is only one way of helping these great charities
2232281 some catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new pearl harbor
2232282 the hall is used to provide a gathering place that anyone can use
2232283 the uniqueness of the area will be lost if we dont continue to make the repairs and renovations
2232284 my goal is to be a head coach at the division i level
2232285 working under mike pressler has been an outstanding opportunity my role as the defensive and recruiting coordinator will certainly allow me to learn how to be successful at the highest level to prepare myself to make that move when the right opportunity comes along there is no question that the move to division i puts bryant mens lacrosse on the map nationally being a part of the transition that is happening right now is as good an opportunity a young coach could ask for combine that with working under arguably one of the most respected and accomplished coaches in the sport of lacrosse is an unreal opportunity
2232286 quarrying through york county stories from heart of the granite
2232287 my interest lies mostly in the stories of the stone workers and their art but one cant know the worker without knowing where he did his best work that being one of the 20 or so quarries of york county
2232288 theyd say this has nothing to do with me or i dont know enough about this
2232289 they did not seem to be very involved politically at all
2232290 if kids dont have the information lets get it to them
2232291 i was part of the process during that part of my life civil rights anti war protests
2232292 this is their country and this is their future we just want them to be participate
2232293 that was important to me that we open up a dialogue so that people leave talking about what affects them
2232294 unless youre really poor or have a decent job or are a child you wont be covered they absolutely dont understand the consequences
2232295 kids were running and jumping there was a lot of joy and appreciation
2232296 if you go into it and say its so depressing youre not going to make any difference
2232297 you do hold peoples hands as they die but what you bring away from that is their stories and its a celebration of their stories
2232298 they sing all the time youre eating your eggs and its like a choir coming out of the kitchen it really bonds them
2232299 they have nothing and they are just the strongest people because they have to be
2232300 they have little bits i have little bits and everybodys willing to teach
2232301 you tell their story and you can help the next generation
2232302 the community has supported me i want them to know theyve created an amazing change in the world
2232303 the reason its an important story is that it makes you reflect
2232304 people from all over the country were flocking into the office
2232305 we have suggested donation levels for our items but we are thrilled about the number of people who have chosen to donate over and above these levels
2232306 any large extraction contracts and to support the enactment of an ordinance to regulate extraction
2232307 it is very important that we let our kkw trustees and town selectpeople know we are serious about protecting our water and that it should be a public trust
2232308 this proposal presents an immediate sustainable and environmentally conscientious solution to our waste problem
2232309 and this solution is also an intriguing economic development opportunity with great potential to attract new business create good jobs and propel maine forward on the path to clean sustainable energy development
2232310 it would go past the riverland irrigators who are on a two per cent allocation they wouldnt be able to use it itd go past the city of adelaide and it would then evaporate in the lower lakes and only one fifth of the water would actually get there
2232311 youd need five times more to drive the water down that would be a grossly irresponsible action
2232312 cubbie is the easiest place in australia to point a finger at but theyre continually pointing a finger in the wrong direction
2232313 our estimation and our intelligence indicates that this syndicate is alleged to be involved in something in the order of 60 per cent of importations coming into south east australia
2232314 it is classic organised crime and we have done our best to shut down the syndicate
2232315 it shows that the australian federal police are taking action to protect the youth on our streets
2232316 it is another success story in a long line of recent achievements in tackling both domestic and transnational crime
2232317 the volume of the seizure indicates that the international syndicates saw australia as a potentially fertile market
2232318 we hope that impression has well and truly been smashed
2232319 today the court of appeal has confirmed that in queensland an accused person can receive a fair trial with a properly directed jury that juries can arrive at intelligent decisions on the evidence put before them and only the evidence put before them
2232320 i welcome the decision today of course it places confidence in our justice system in queensland and i do expect everyone to abide by the decision
2232321 well certainly there have been high profile cases in the past and will be in the future
2232322 potentially the patel matter is one of those but this actually proves that the court system in queensland believes that such high profile individuals can actually get a fair trial in this state
2232323 it was always the worst decision possible to say you cant get a fair trial therefore youre free
2232324 if he is convicted of this then he will be a prisoner and then we have an opportunity for the indefinite sentencing legislation to kick in
2232325 justice will take its course and thats all weve ever asked for
2232326 i would doubt if mr ferguson could get a fair trial
2232327 the mind can only absorb what the seat can endure
2232328 im going to change leadership and im asking which of these three should i choose
2232329 either im a genius or lots of people can do this
2232330 do you have the tools you need to do the job
2232331 you i hold accountable for this you are accountable you know it
2232332 if a manager cannot use substantial financial incentives his people will go someplace else
2232333 god must have one hell of a sense of humor to put me in that position
2232334 we are consistently working with regulators toward a comprehensive solution for all auction rate securities investors
2232335 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
2232336 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
2232337 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
2232338 among the african species the great apes such as gorillas and bonobos have always tended to grab the limelight and even though they are deeply threatened it is smaller primates such as the red colobus that could die out first
2232339 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change

2232377 domestic violence is a criminal act which has to be dealt with accordingly
2232378 one of the women who came for support to ekaterina said shed endured 14 years of violence said her partner beat her during her pregnancy raped her after an operation gave her insulting and hurtful nicknames refused to pay child maintenance prejudiced her child against her and beat her repeatedly
2232379 this project aims to influence the attitude perception and opinion of the general public and professionals in responding to domestic violence cases
2232380 there is a basic lack of understanding and compassion for such victims at every level
2232381 that means that three is no help to make a complaint and if a slightest mistake is made all paperwork is sent back to victims which results in the women losing the will to do proceed with their cases
2232382 if a case does reach court which is very rare the presiding justice of the peace has no awareness of domestic violence and that is where our work is making a difference
2232383 the jury is still out on whether these technologies are positive or negative
2232384 separated parents are criticised so often i felt strongly that i wanted to report on some positive examples of functioning happy divorced families who like the rest of us are just doing the best they can and to offer practical help to assist parents in making the right choices for what to say and how to relate to each other after separation
2232385 as we continue to expand our export markets in conjunction with uk trade and investment we have needed to increase our workforce to cope with growing demand
2232386 weve also invested in state of the art weighing methods and have added new vehicles
2232387 public consciousness about recycling is at an all time high which has boosted our business our goal is to stop any waste going to landfill
2232388 were delighted that this message is getting through to children we talk to in schools we all have to recycle now for future generations
2232389 and in staffordshire and beyond we have also been able to support the county air ambulance and other worthy charities so our customers are also pleased to be able to help with that
2232390 we know there is a big demand out there for this service time and money is very tight for haulage companies at the moment due to fuel price increases so we know every penny counts our cost effective service offers excellent value
2232391 and as we are local we know that time is money and hope firms can benefit from the convenience of popping by and setting an account up with us

2232414 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2232415 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2232416 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2232417 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2232418 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2232447 a recent report demonstrates that about 46 percent of americans will have some type of mental disorder during their lifetimes
2232448 most of them will experience symptoms before the age of 14 if we can treat these children early we can avoid long term consequences in adolescence and adulthood including suicide
2232449 they do it because theyre hopeless but things are rarely totally hopeless and they just need a fresh pair of eyes to look at it

2232463 my father worked in the purchases and stores department with air canada my mother was a school secretary education was very important when i was growing up my parents were very encouraging when i was in school in fact my mother went back to school at the age of 80 to take a bachelor of arts degree at the university of toronto she studied to get her honours but passed away the night before she was to receive the degree
2232464 i loved to play sports hockey i played tennis skied being from montreal theres lots of great skiing there swimming baseball football anything of that nature i loved doing
2232465 i made my first investment in the stock market when i was a teenager it was a mining company based in new brunswick and i made a little money on the stock i think that whet my appetite for the business world at university i studied corporate finance and really enjoyed taking apart companies looking at their financial models and figuring out what made them work when i finished university like most students i didnt know what to do i started in human resources at dupont of canada and then i worked at the royal victoria hospital it wasnt called human resources in those days it was called personnel then i worked for a computer company first of all in human resources and then in sales and then i moved into the brokerage business it was great because it was an opportunity to try a lot of different things id work in an area for a year and a half or so and then id say gee this isnt really what i want to do for the rest of my life finally when i landed in the investment business as a stock broker i thought well ill give this a try and 35 36 years later im still at it i was very fortunate that i could do a lot of different things because its great to be able to come to work every day and be excited about doing it its not necessarily how a lot of people are
2232466 with a company called dupont glore forgan it was a brokerage firm run by ross perot the u s computer millionaire then i worked for baker weeks a u s based investment research firm then i joined montreal trust as a portfolio manager taking care of individuals money and subsequently moved into the institutional business in toronto with the same company in 1977 i had my own firm for a few years with a couple of partners and then i was recruited here by sir john templeton who was the founder of the templeton organization ive been here since 1989
2232467 i first met sir john in the early 80s and then subsequently ran into him several times he started recruiting me around 87 88 but i was at a firm and really had no interest one day a chief executive from templeton galbraith and hansberger that was the name of the firm asked me whether i would like to come to visit with sir john in lyford cay his home in the bahamas if id like to spend half a day with him my response to him was i would love to however i didnt really think i was interested in making a move if that was all this was intended for i didnt want to mislead them he said certainly they would like to recruit me but going down there was not conditional so i went down and i did spend half a day with sir john we talked about everything we talked about investments we talked about canada we talked about everything you can possibly imagine even non investment topics i didnt take a resum with me because i had no intention of being recruited even today the firm still doesnt have my resum from that time but as i was going back to the airport the chief executive of the firm who reported to sir john who was chairman of the firm said sir john would like to hire you i was given the possibility to think about it for the next month i discussed it with my family and decided that i would like to make that move there were several reasons that led me to that decision one of which was the group that i was with i was not able to practise international investing there i had been a founder of the international society of financial analysts and i liked the international markets but the key reason was really meeting with sir john talking about his values discussing his philosophies on markets and i guess on life generally it was that time that i spent with sir john that caused me to join the organization and here i am now itll be 19 years later in september and its been just an incredible period of time
2232468 the first time that i ever attended a meeting where he spoke was in new york city
2232469 your son should go out and take an mba program and go into the business world
2232470 but everybody knows thats the case with that company so everybody is paying prices that are too high and thats why i dont own the stock there were all kinds of anecdotes over the years we could probably spend a month and not go through them all
2232471 essentially he was my mentor all the way through my career and also became a very good friend looking back what an incredible opportunity it was to be able to spend all that time with one of the very few gurus in the business the way that i invest my clients assets whether its the mutual funds i manage or part of a clients pension fund is based on core principles that have been in the organization since he first started the organization in the 1940 41 timeframe he believed in value investing as i do
2232472 long term my focus is really international ive managed canadian equities and i still do but the biggest part of my job is managing international money the mutual fund that i manage is the templeton international stock fund its a 2 7 billion fund in addition to that i manage assets for parts of pension funds for corporations and government agencies and so on
2232473 were bottom up investors really meaning that were populating our portfolios on a stock by stock basis with that comes a diversified portfolio were not thematic were not looking for industries were value investors and were looking on a long term basis for securities that are cheap and have good potential typically well hold a stock for five years probably longer than anybody else youve ever talked to
2232474 when i take a look at the portfolios that i manage exposure is heaviest in telecom that would mean a lot of my process shows a lot more bargains in telecoms than it has in other areas the other area where our exposure is the least is in the financial sector that means we cant find as many good value situations in the financial sector so theres no theme to the way we invest but you get up one day and you see your exposure as heavy in one area or several areas and it got there on a stock by stock basis we have pretty good exposure to the energy sector as well
2232475 our clients pay us for our investment capabilities so we tend to be fully invested
2232476 when things get a little bit pricey with companies then we sell those positions it sounds simplistic but its a fact
2232477 in terms of risk management we have several different operations within the company first of all we have people that use quantitative measures to monitor the risk in our portfolios secondly we have a peer review process where my portfolios are put in front of the whole research department 34 analysts there are other people as well the portfolios are put forward just to make sure that my portfolios are lined up with our overall investment philosophy
2232478 we dont use technical analysis but we have a very comprehensive database on companies that were looking at companies that we may want to buy in the future and companies that we currently own that gives us the ability to collect about 260 pieces of information on every company we have a research technology group of four or five people that do screens on those situations and our analysts in addition to those databases will have industry specific databases on the companies that they follow each analyst will follow an industry sector or part of a sector depending on the size of the sector and do the research and present the ideas to the research group
2232479 im not sure pressure is really the right term in the mutual fund for example i put a lot of money into it personally so that ill be really living with the investors with a long term focus im not really worried about what happened yesterday or whether the price of oil went up a dollar a barrel today or whether the canadian dollar was down half a cent or gold is up 10 an ounce over the last couple of weeks thats not the kind of thing that im looking for as long as im comfortable with the companies that are owned in the portfolio then i can operate pretty comfortably and be rational as opposed to getting over excited about things
2232480 that works very closely in line with the financial institutions and where the financial institutions are lending money the consumer is quite key so were seeing a slowdown and a credit crunch simultaneously from our standpoint in canada if we see consumption declining dramatically were the second largest exporter to the u s now we used to be first that could have an impact on us and the level of the canadian dollar could have an impact on us in terms of our export industry and our tourism industry it is having an impact on us and thats hurting manufacturing i dont see it having a great impact on the money that i manage since i invest very little in the u s and canada but if you look at our global portfolios that invest in every country then one thing youll notice is our exposure to the u s is well below the amount thats in the world index
2232481 the portfolios that i manage are overweight compared to the global index in asia but under weight in japan japan is about 21 per cent of the eafe europe australia far east index and im at 1 500 basis points so i am below that weighting but im overweight in asia in places like china hong kong taiwan korea and a little bit in singapore as well i think were going to continue to see good growth in china and that has a major impact on the rest of asia whereas japan is struggling a little bit it has been for over a decade but were still able to find some companies there
2232482 i look after the canadian company and i sit on the executive committee of the overall company and i manage money to manage money it takes patience theres a lot of homework to do looking at companies thats a big part of my job managing the company here in canada that also requires some patience and identifying people that can do jobs better than i can
2232483 i think corporate governance is quite good in canada i am on the board of the canadian coalition for good governance and governance in general has been improving over the last number of years there are many things that weve done work on like majority voting thats starting to creep into proxy voting also work that were doing on compensation its not to keep compensation low its to make sure ceos of companies are fairly compensated so that if things are not going well for the company you do not see ceos making inordinately high amounts of money pay for performance is really the name of the game there is improving transparency in companies the compensation committee of the company should not have the ceo sitting on it determining his own compensation having independent directors that work on your boards and having meaningful positions on the committees and many if not all of the committees having a majority of independent directors and separating the chairmans role from the ceos role those are two different functions one is overseeing the board the other is overseeing the day to day activities of the company those are important things to see in a company
2232484 hard to know probably working as an investment counselor for a small investment counselling company sitting on corporate boards and investment committees i dont do well sitting back and chilling out i like to be active you can only play so much golf

2232601 we are also entrusted with the responsibility of protecting montana investors from becoming fraud victims we wont tolerate unscrupulous investment promoters in montana and i will do all that i can administratively to halt these investment abuses and will seek criminal sanctions when warranted
2232602 time and time again we see investors harmed by the fraudulent activity of firms and their representatives

2232608 the wheeler center has had a tremendous influence on the policy and legislation in the state
2232609 a planner and community designer also goes into a community without an agenda to try to help a community develop public policy in a geographic area
2232610 this state is still a place where we share the jeffersonian idea that the people have control over their landscape and their lives and the balance between individual rights and the communitys rights is still quite achievable
2232611 here an individual can have an influence on the state
2232612 i think roundup ready is a critical feature in winter canola at this time so that weeds can be managed simply and effectively in a patchy stand
2232613 the ability of safflower and sunflower to make yield on stored soil water is nothing short of amazing

2232615 there has been a definite improvement over the last year
2232616 most of the anti pollution efforts put into place for the olympics will stay in effect afterwards

2232618 finally a light designed for hunters by hunters the carnivore blood tracking light combines bright xenon light with brand new patent pending trax blood tracking technology the sportsman can easily toggle between bright xenon and trax to find his wounded game
2232619 the courts decision will make voting harder for the elderly
2232620 the record lacks concrete evidence that 84 004 has had an appreciable impact on elderly and disabled voter participation on this record the court cannot conclude that 84 004 has had a chilling effect on voters or that 84 004 has disenfranchised the voting public to any appreciable extent
2232621 t he states position is that section 208 empowers the voter to choose the person who will assist him or her but the voter is not entitled to his or her preferred choice if that choice is reasonably restricted by the state in the states view the protection afforded the voter by section 208 is simply that the voter is not required to accept another persons choice
2232622 i really noticed the first day that it was pretty smoggy we landed on the plane and i think we were all like wow is this weather is this smog is this fog what is it it was kind of surprising to see that
2232623 the air quality i think its good it looks a little bit misty you cannot judge the air quality by its appearance you have to trust the scientists
2232624 all those results have brought us to the gate of the olympic games we will be able to ensure that air quality during the games is good enough
2232625 with this rain we expect the weather in beijing to be clearly improved
2232626 we have to look at the favorable weather conditions which can help spread and remove major pollutants
2232627 they turned the factories off a lot of the roads are blocked off so there arent as many cars i think its in the best condition it has ever been in but its still very hot and very humid and its pretty tough ive practiced out there the last two days and it is probably the most humid place ive ever played
2232628 first you are meditating and using incense to set the mood and instead you set off the fire alarm then after adt calls you decide to move the smoke out of the house by turning on the attic fan and while sucking up the smoke into the attic it also sucks the 110 degree 100 humidity air into the house and then you realize that the fan is still broken and you cant turn it off and potentially you will be sucking air into the house all day long on one of the hottest day of the year and then you call me and i cant come home and fix the fan and we realize that your arms are not as long as my monkey arms and i cannot effectively describe my trick of turning off the fan and you are too lame to actually do it yourself so then you stand outside in the 110 degree 100 humidity weather turning the fuse switches off and on off and on off and on multiple times around the box until you finally figure out which one turns the fan off and then you go out in the subaru to run some errands and the check engine light starts flashing while the power nearly cuts off in the car you coast into the post office parking lot and call me i call aaa and find out that they will not be able to tow the car for two hours you have a choice of sitting by the car in the 110 degree 100 humidity weather or walking back 15 minutes back to the house in the 110 degree 100 humidity weather and then walking 15 minutes back to the car in the 110 degree 100 humidity weather when the tow truck arrives and then walking 15 minutes back to the house in the by then 115 degree 100 humidity weather after the tow truck leaves you opt to walk and have some time in the a c vs sit by the car like a roasted idiot and then you get a call from our daycare at 4 30 in the afternoon to decide which pre k class conor is going enroll in the going to kindergarten next year pre k class or the going to wait another year before going to kindergarten pre k class this bring to a massive head the discussions weve been having for the last week about whether it would be better for conor to be the oldest or the youngest student in his class he will always be the tallest but should we honor his introversion or his curiousity in when he starts kindergarten we continue to note that everyone we know who has been the youngest in their class has hated it while those who have been the oldest or in the middle have not noticed it the benefits for holding conor back are numerous and could include more self confidence now and college scholarships later the benefits of letting him go forward include keeping him apace with some of his friends and keeping him from being bored for his first few years at school daycare gives us a week to decide while we try to make one of the biggest decisions in conors life thus far and we cannot get his reasoned input on it and then we get a call at 8 15 at night from the fancy california ivf clinic to discuss test results and while everything looks great on the fertility side blood levels and egg counts there is a problem with another test and they have decided to cancel our ivf cycle this month resolve the test issues and reschedule the ivf for october you point out your lack of vacation days or sick days as a professor but agree to the delay they point out that nothing is inherently wrong or bad but were delayed again so does that kind of sum up how the day has gone
2232629 flip a coin and see if you feel that initial surge of gladness or regret at how it turns out

2232650 it makes you think them being an alarm business its supposed to be for your security they arent supposed to be leaving your information laying around anywhere
2232651 the gentleman left behind what appeared to be some paperwork my wife had taken a closer look at what it was exactly that they left behind we were shocked to find that it was private information and the passwords for our neighbors
2232652 the technician indicated that he had been contacted by the customer and that he or another technician had attempted to contact the customer at her home on four separate occasions to retrieve the information on each occasion nobody answered the door
2232653 pretty much anyone could have entered the house the alarm would not have done its job if they are going to do a job do it right they sell you a product to protect you but they take your information and carelessly leave it anywhere
2232654 these statistics are becoming increasingly worrying and for the average amount of spam blocked per person to have nearly quadrupled in the last three months suggests that action desperately needs to be taken
2232655 im not an awards driven person in anything anytime you do get caught up in that you usually end up getting whacked
2232656 a man turns 50 and he has a funeral for the skills that he never had

2232661 its just that what you do it doesnt have as important a place in the lives of people now
2232662 the world is in a really tough spot and you can make people laugh and do a tv show and thats important to them but
2232663 how long does that last that effect how long do you take their mind off other things and the second question becomes
2232664 i know this sounds like im being handy but its handy and true at the same time which works quite well the networks have to do it clean i love the sopranos i love everything on the cable stations where its much more hard edged salty more adult the networks we dont have that luxury you cant go blue youve got to keep it clean thats harder to do the fact that we have a smart show with nothing that caustic or harsh is a miracle to talk about what i want to do to condoleezza rice sexually without saying something really really anatomical that takes a lot of doing
2232665 i suspended my account and i find it atrocious that you would not clearly tell the people who are receiving my profile that this is the case
2232666 you mean 15 000 people are joining daily and i am only compatable with 2

2232668 the dems have just met in denver and chosen obama and my email address is blahblah oohay with service provider spelled backwards

2232674 they had everything in that you need to win a super bowl they just have to police each other buy into the system buy into the team frame and make sure you be a great teammate if they do all those things they give themselves a chance to do it
2232675 you cant win the super bowl today what they have to do is come here to work on their skills and timing and get in shape then they have to start with the four preseason games but then against cleveland thats when it starts win your division and have the best record in the nfc you cant worry about the super bowl until the playoffs get here
2232676 you saw the dallas mavericks had that window and that window closed on them
2232677 you can keep mannys options as long as you realize his throat has been acting up and he might need a few months or years to rest
2232678 i was not able to guarantee to the national coach that i would still be playing football at the end of the coming season during which i am under contract to stuttgart
2232679 in these conditions i proposed to him and to andreas kopke that they should no longer include me in the national squad it has been a good period for me in the german team
2232680 he brought a great deal to german football above all it was his leadership quality which impressed me i dont know many players able to bring such experience into a team
2232681 the excitement is taking over everyone and in a way we cant wait to get saturday underway
2232682 charlton will be a huge test and its clear that if you switch off you are going to get heavily punished
2232683 the valley is a very tough place to go but in a way its perfect because we are going to be pushed to our maximum
2232684 finally a word on the possible sexism of my language this issue has dogged my steps for a while and i want to state my position on it once and for all english is not my language though i have developed a taste for it it was once forced upon me even now i often form my thoughts in my native bengali and then translate when i have to put them down on paper now after thirty years of toil i have acquired reasonable competence in the language i am told by the progeny of those who first imposed it on me that i have been taught the wrong english by my forefathers that i must now relearn the language frankly i am too old to do so those who are offended by my language may console themselves by remembering that the language in which i think has traditionally looked at the male and female differently
2232685 theres no way mark cant win its been such a close race and now with this he will definitely win

2232688 stevens knows alaska he knows that most of us have a hard time making money and he wants to help us out of course we want to keep him around for as long as we can hes doing a great job i dont care if hes 90

2232700 i dont know if my church loves me any more or not
2232701 when he said no she apologized and assured him that she would find him later
2232702 especially in a matter as high profile as this the court was disappointed that much of the testimony particularly as it related to public figures within the state of new jersey and the dirty laundry associated therewith needed to be aired in the public and in the press the mcgreeveys clearly had agendas as previously addressed their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2232703 im in talks right now i think i found a really good space

2232707 this lawsuit seeks to shut down the companys unlawful operation before more people are exploited by the scam
2232708 this is great news for me and countless number of travel agents
2232709 and i congratulate the states for finally taking action against this company
2232710 in 2007 only 38 percent of the companys members made any travel commissions
2232711 for the minority of members who made any travel commission in 2007 the median income was 39 00 less than one months cost to keep the website there are at least 139 000 of the companys travel websites all virtually identical on the internet
2232712 the toughest filed so far against the company since it stared operations seven years ago
2232713 with a horde of unqualified wonders out there claiming to be a professional travel agent and offering to get you a great deal
2232714 i can understand why some folks shy away from the real travel agent
2232715 fill the gap in the market with a model that gives consumers greater control safety and efficiency and creates more qualified inquiries for participating attorneys
2232716 we built our service around what people find everywhere else on the web today the ability to get an immediate answer without revealing confidential details or giving out their name and phone number
2232717 this will make whocanisue com the go to choice when people feel theyve been wronged and are looking for answers
2232718 as far as consumers are concerned the more information the better
2232719 i mean what legitimate lawyer would pay 1 000 a month or more to be listed on a site that actually makes fun of lawsuits

2232735 hi there this is police community support officer bloggs im trying to arrange a community clean up day and wonder if you would assist us by providing a couple of street cleaners for a few hours to help the residents with some street cleaning
2232736 that sounds like its do able let me speak to my boss im sure it wont be a problem

2232738 organizers are hoping fridays money bomb will bring in 1 million to add to the approximately 350 000 the group collected to oppose the foreign intelligence surveillance act which it used to placed ads attacking three democrats who supported the surveillance legislation

2232740 in entering into new commitments for public provided financial support for trade with iran notably the granting of export credits guarantees or insurance
2232741 carry out inspections at their airports and maritime ports on cargo going to and from iran
2232742 stability in lebanon will be helped to the extent the west understands and relaxes its position on the issue of the iranian nuclear reactor
2232743 well i turned that movie down but then i signed on to make a sequel to jfk only this time jfk is still alive and he plays baseball now plus it has ashton kutcher so that should be a good career move
2232744 in 2004 there was no investment budget in 2005 the investment budget was 3 billion in 2006 it was 11 billion and in 2007 was 12 billion
2232745 in the years before 2008 less than half the investment budget was spent because of the security issue
2232746 i think its absurd that were paying for the reconstruction in a country when right at the beginning of the war the bush administration assured the american people that iraqs reconstruction would be paid for by iraq and through its oil revenues
2232747 inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
2232748 we are dealing with it through other channels measures have already been taken and we will follow them up if necessary and if appropriate
2232749 have agreed that while informal contacts between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iranian negotiator saeed jalili will continue we now have no choice but to pursue further sanctions against iran as part of our dual track strategy
2232750 it may well be that in the course of those discussions some members of the six raised the issue of the sanctions
2232751 but to the best of my knowledge there has been no firm agreement or understanding or concerted work in this regard
2232752 the main thing to remember is the negotiating track is open there are contacts between the parties we need to focus very much on the negotiating opportunities which this may produce
2232753 security authorities launched an investigation last saturday august 2 immediately after the prison break to ascertain the facts and means of escape
2232754 both escapees are saudi nationals however we are still looking into the means of escape
2232755 we deal with all forms of prison breaks and the truth must come to light regardless of the situation officials who have been negligent must be held accountable if the escape is a result of their negligence irrespective of the reasons
2232756 there is much difficulty in obtaining information from those close to brig gen suleiman his family or acquaintances because they are not answering their cell phones contacting or talking to them remains impossible so far
2232757 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
2232758 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now
2232759 pursuing the policy of public praise and private pressure on pakistan doesnt work
2232760 we need to enhance the capacity of hitting these targets
2232761 religion is one of the most important components of our society and culture but there are some groups that employ it as a means to develop their subversive ideas
2232762 these groups are attempting to invest in the hardships that are hitting the country to serve their own interest
2232763 what is the political appropriation of religion in a state that is already religious
2232764 the muslim brotherhood truly believes in its ideology otherwise it would not have paid the price by their souls money and freedom
2232765 should the muslim brotherhood rise to power it will recognize israel and respect the treaties signed with it
2232766 i dont know if the panel can render fair what has already happened
2232767 this military judge is to be commended for providing a fair and internationally legally sufficient trial for the accused and the government regardless of the ultimate verdict
2232768 his policies have weakened the federation and eroded the trust of the nation in national institutions
2232769 the coalition further decided that it will immediately initiate impeachment proceedings the coalition leadership will present a charge sheet against gen musharraf
2232770 we hope that 90 percent of the lawmakers will support us
2232771 we have backed him and voted for him so we are duty bound to support him we will oppose impeachment
2232772 there is a strong likelihood but not certainty that the ruling coalition can impeach him
2232773 the army would be crazy for doing that the army needs to improve its reputation and image with the people of pakistan
2232774 by making such remarks the iranian officials are hinting at punishing the gulf cooperation council countries
2232775 supporting irans right in using nuclear energy for peaceful means and their rejection of any military action against it
2232776 watching a stressful sports game involving the national team can more than double the risk of an acute cardiovascular event and the uaes poor cardiovascular record means spectators here can be even more at risk
2232777 sports enthusiasts who prefer watching the proceedings from the sofa rather than engaging in physical activity themselves should be aware that statistically the comfort of their living room is no safer than actually competing
2232778 the p5 1 major powers are discussing next steps in the u n security council and beginning to consider possible outlines of another sanctions resolution
2232779 regarding our response the matter is not clear so far we are studying the issue and studying the response
2232780 when certain points are clarified then we will send our response we are waiting for some clarifications
2232781 there is no choice now other than imposing new sanctions on iraq
2232782 we were disappointed by irans failure to send javier solana a positive response to the six major countrys generous offer
2232783 we have no choice now but to impose new sanctions on iran we regret that the iranian leaders have obviously chosen isolation
2232784 just let us know of any field work in iraq or neighboring countries and it will be approved in advance
2232785 weapons are to be exclusively in the hands of one group the resistance group
2232786 al assad did not come to mediate between us and the europeans we no longer need a syrian or non syrian mediator because the communication channels between us are open and direct in fact al assad visited us to convey his impressions of a private conversation that took place between him and french president nicolas sarkozy during his recent visit to paris
2232787 my dear you pursued your late fathers policy under which our relations continue to be good and distinguished
2232788 as a confidence building measure as a gesture of good will
2232789 we are defending islam and its sanctity this is the country we were raised in why should we stand by while our men are defending the country
2232790 the americans took my husband they destroyed our home weve got nothing were living by the grace of god we will not stay silent and everything including bombings we can do in response
2232791 violence by u s or iraqi forces will lead in many cases to grudges and a wish to take revenge especially when husbands are killed i think this is one of the main reasons for female bomb attacks
2232792 female suicide bombers cost little provide ease of planning and are relatively free of risk to terror organizations there is little chance that security forces will obtain sensitive information from them
2232793 we hope that more women will join us in this work
2232794 of course i m not coming into the olympics with big wins behind but i have put in my best efforts and have my fingers crossed
2232795 i trained in italy for quite a while and have been practising here since the last 10 days i did all i could and think all would depend on how i fare on the day of competition

2232797 i want to see how things go i m improving i played in la and montreal but i could see that i wasn t prepared i had some issues with physical strength where i m not as good as i used to be
2232798 we tell the sons of france and the slaves of america and we tell their masters too that our finger is on the trigger and the convoys of martyrs are longing to rampage your bastions in defense of our islamic nation
2232799 i hope the day comes that you return to your wife and daughters and your country and youre able to be a provider a father and a husband in the best sense of all those terms
2232800 they chose to make this a test case but they never imagined that it would result in such a stunning rebuff
2232801 the government attempted to inflame the emotions of the panel
2232802 asking for 30 years to life not only was ill advised and wholly inappropriate but was also soundly rejected by the panel
2232803 it was all for show if mr hamdan does not go home in december
2232804 i would like to apologize one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
2232805 i can reassure you that the defense department is hard at work on this issue
2232806 the decision showed what the jury thought hamdan was worth
2232807 there is a perception that trying people in front of the military was going to be a rubber stamp process
2232808 this shows they are conscientious following instructions and are making rational decisions
2232809 its true there are work opportunities in yemen but not at the level i needed after i got married and not to the level of ambitions that i had in my future
2232810 i personally present my apologies to them if anything that i did has caused them pain
2232811 you have found him guilty of offenses that have made our world extremely unsafe and dangerous
2232812 the government asks you to deliver a sentence that will absolutely keep our society safe from him
2232813 the problem is the law was specifically written after the fact to target mr hamdan
2232814 this is the time of year people are going to be in the sun more often and sun exposure can increase your chance of getting skin cancer
2232815 everyone except for babies under six months should wear sunscreen you should put it on about 20 minutes before you go outside you should also avoid the sun between 10 and 4 when the uv rays are their strongest and its important to wear protective clothing
2232816 a is asymmetry so if the mole doesnt have a perfect circular shape you might want to just keep an eye on it b stands for border and that can be an irregular border or its not perfectly round c is for color so if youve got a mole that has different colors throughout it its important to watch it as well and d stands for diameter typically a mole that could develop into cancer is about the diameter of a pencil eraser
2232817 if this is not war then i wonder what is
2232818 i wake up in the morning with an idea and it makes my day to think of adding a couple of lines to my program it gives me a real high it must be the way poets feel or musicians or painters programming does that for me

2232823 the sovereignty issue is very big for the iraqis and we understand that but we are losing patience
2232824 the process needs to get moving and get moving quickly
2232825 this move is meant to offer an incentive for the foreign forces to withdraw
2232826 the special cells of fighters will not strike against foreign forces until the situation becomes clear vis a vis the iraq u s agreement on the presence of american forces here

2232836 the fact that the activities i had yesterday and the way the knee responded today honestly i do feel positive in the sense that were progressing forward
2232837 what we can say after two world championship and a number of continental championships is that it will make it easier to differentiate between gymnasts

2232852 the mme with the inclusion of the act is a rigorous test and all students have to be prepared with the knowledge to excel
2232853 as the requirements of the new high school curriculum continue to be implemented we expect to see students scores improve
2232854 once all students are given the opportunity to become proficient in subjects like algebra where districts are developing different ways for kids to learn in a traditional classroom or a career pathway we will see this commitment by schools and students rewarded with greater success for all kids
2232855 i think everybody had a little better heads up just because theyre more familiar with it
2232856 the teachers being familiar with it help them prepare the students for the test
2232857 we did not see any improvements in areas where we see a dire need for improvement
2232858 that still shows a lack of alignment of what many students are learning and what the tests measure
2232859 i dont think you can determine how smart a person is by taking a standardized test
2232860 its unique to be able to raise your scores from year to year in every category which we were able to do
2232861 we have focused on reading and writing over the curriculum over the past few years we did implement algebra as the staple course in the eighth grade it has been a challenging transition but i believe it has helped us be able to prepare our students to be prepared for the math portion they have to take
2232862 we are realigning the curriculum to match the new rigorous curriculum the state has set forth
2232863 im concerned about the fact that one size doesnt fit all
2232864 i would like to see a little more flexibility for those individuals that dont fit into this type of program
2232865 student test scores remain low state officials expect results to improve as more are educated under new graduation requirements

2232883 we want to be responsive to our commuter students whether they are extension center students or students coming to the new orleans campus
2232884 the increased fuel cost is something we are all experiencing but the burden falls much harder on our commuting students we want students to know that we are doing all we can to mitigate the dramatic increase in costs that they are experiencing
2232885 it is a way to help our students be good stewards of their own resources and of the environment
2232886 first of all on campus students have greater access to the courses they need
2232887 these courses are routinely offered in each semester many of them multiple times it is not normally an issue of students being able to get the courses
2232888 secondly the seminary receives no sbc funding at all for internet courses whereas the sbc provides maximum funding for on campus students
2232889 in order to keep the regular tuition affordable for everyone we had to limit who takes the internet courses
2232890 it is not our intention to continue the exception past one year
2232891 our hope is that this will give students time to adjust their budgets and driving patterns for the increased travel costs
2232892 its a much more commuter friendly schedule now on wednesdays and fridays
2232893 a lot of these classes will be wednesday only classes students could consider doing a monday wednesday schedule as another option they can easily take a full time load that way

2232904 los datos son bastante mejores de lo que esper bamos para la primera retransmisi n todav a nos estamos haciendo conocer para mucha gente y nunca se ha hecho nada igual para los juegos

2232906 con la villa queremos ofrecer a nuestro p blico la capacidad de interactuar directamente con los deportistas y dar mucha m s visibilidad a esos deportes y atletas que s lo salen una vez cada cuatro a os queremos que la villa se convierta en nuestra red social de deportes para siempre que contin e tras los juegos para que esos deportes deportistas y las comunidades alrededor de ellos sigan teniendo presencia importante en rtve es siempre

2232915 what were talking about is changing the vehicle for the people who are thinking about how to communicate in new ways smart agencies who are using blogs to communicate will realize they dont need to separate them from the agency site they should be the same thing tell a story share an experience and inspire an idea
2232916 its an afghan government plan he gates has endorsed and we are now working to achieve
2232917 now who would pay for that those are the discussions we are just now beginning to enter into it would be wrong to assume we are going to shoulder this burden alone
2232918 we are going to work with our allies to determine how we can finance this necessary growth
2232919 quality versus quantity we are focused there on remediating and reforming the police forces that currently exist
2232920 the main additional responsibility he is assuming is for the training mission which is just an essential mission for the afghans and for us
2232921 the sooner they are a capable fighting force and can assume responsibility for protecting their own people and their borders the sooner us forces and the worlds forces can come out
2232922 we are looking for options and ways we can streamline the command and control arrangements for us forces in afghanistan making them more efficient and effective

2232965 he said my potion was the wrong color the text said it was suppose to be iridescent cerulean which it was but he insisted that it was cyan the debate got rather intense and ended with me vanishing the potion taking a t for the day and receiving yet another detention
2232966 hermione severus is the teacher and a potions master if he said it was wrong then
2232967 it wasnt wrong that potion was perfect ask anyone that was in the room it was the perfect color and he knew it but for some reason professor snape has it out for me this year

2233057 pada kenyataan yang lepas saya benarkan pertemuan di antara pemimpin pas dan umno berkaitan islam dan masalah rakyat serupa sahaja dengan kenyataan yang disebut presiden pas
2233058 kalau difahami betul betul tidak bercanggah di antara satu sama lain
2233059 masalah yang dialami di negeri negeri yang diperintah oleh pakatan rakyat kita minta kerajaan pusat menyelesaikan itu yang kita bincangkan dalam pertemuan dengan pemimpin umno
2233060 tidak timbul masalah pas menyertai kerajaan kerana pas masih lagi bersama dengan pakatan rakyat
2233061 ketika itu tidak timbul isu muzakarah majlis syura telah menangapi perlu diberi ruang untuk kita bermuqabalah dari face to face
2233062 namun apa yang timbul sekarang perkataan muzakarah itu seolah perlawanan seperti yang berlaku di dewan bahasa dan pustaka baru baru ini di antara menteri penerangan dan dato seri anwar ibrahim
2233063 kita tidak mahu berlawan macam itu kita nafikan ada muzakarah kalau dedahkan begitu akan menimbulkan masalah kerana akan ada yang kalah dan menang hanya apa yang ada sekadar pertemuan biasa

2233073 tidak berlaku dalam suatu kejayaan yang lebih besar daripada kejayaan perjanjian hudaibiyah sekalipun jika disbanding dengan kejayaan perang badar perang uhud perang khandaq dan lain lain lagi sesungguhnya manusia berperang selama ini ketika mereka bertembung apabila perdamaian telah berjaya diusahakan oleh rasulullah saw api peperangan telah terpadam mereka hidup dalam aman damai saling bertemu dan berbincang muqabalah dan muzakarah antara satu sama lain islam makin diterima oleh penentangnya kerana sememangnya islam itu agama yang paling sesuai untuk mengatur kehidupan manusia dalam masa beberapa tahun selepas perjanjian damai semakin ramai orang menganut atau menerima islam berbanding semasa orang islam dan orang kafir berperang

2233178 when she finally regains consciousness and tries to speak her doctor leans over to hear her sigh contently and to feebly ask where is that marvelous ape
2233179 john mccain is the eddie haskell of politics you can attribute that to me and hell kill me for it
2233180 the beginning of the end of his respect for and friendship with mccain
2233181 he had slipped some highly technical questions to mcclure to ask mofford questions she wouldnt be prepared to answer or expected to answer
2233182 hurt me more than anything to be set up like that
2233183 you will recall during my speech at the dinner for the president in phoenix i announced that you were going to give half of the funds you raised to the state republican party i am told by the party that you still owe them 35 000 and unless you pay all of it or most of it they cannot meet their payroll next wednesday
2233184 a farce mccain famously sponsored a law designed to control special interests grip on washington but at the same time he took money from those interests
2233185 he traces his environmental awareness to the sainted rep mo udall an arizona democrat who took mccain as a young congressman under his tutelage to environmentalists thats like saying you learned about civil rights by driving around alabama with martin luther king jr
2233186 i have always wondered why john mccain has done nothing to fix the problem he must either not see that a problem exists or does not choose to do anything about it it would seem that it would be in everyones best interest to come to terms with the situation and do whatever is necessary to fix it there is so much at risk during my short tenure at avmt i have been surrounded by what on the surface appears to be the ultimate all american family in reality i am working for a very sad lonely woman whose marriage of convenience to a u s senator has driven her to distance herself from friends cover feelings of despair with drugs and replace lonely moments with self indulgences
2233187 that was devastating to me that he brought in a reporter i thought that was crossing the line and it destroyed me
2233188 im sure i would have accepted the offer to go the hospital as well i cant blame lewis but maybe the sight of the legendary mo udall in his final sad days wasnt mccains to share
2233189 you can definitely tell theres a sense of urgency out here considering what could happen this season
2233190 we know that if we take care of business the skys the limit so every guy out here is excited and looking forward to the next day
2233191 weve got a lot of guys out here that are physical guys that love to get after it and cant wait to strap those pads on
2233192 thats what they love to do thats why they play the game
2233193 especially on days like today it was so competitive out there today and i want to be out there so badly i just hate not being able to do what i love to do
2233194 people always talk about how hes always hurt but hes really only missed like six games since hes been here really i know hes gonna get in the training room and so is steve redmond and our unit is going to be solid when it needs to be
2233195 you read all the magazines and theyre saying were the second best unit in the big 12
2233196 coach came and told us that and said guys weve got a lot of work to do so we know its up to us to make sure that were known as the best linebackers in the big 12 once the season gets going

2233591 laki laki yang mencuri dan perempuan yang mencuri potonglah tangan keduanya sebagai pembalasan bagi apa yang mereka kerjakan dan sebagai siksaan dari allah dan allah maha perkasa lagi maha bijaksana
2233592 hai orang orang yang beriman apabila datang berhijrah kepadamu perempuan perempuan yang beriman maka hendaklah kamu uji keimanan mereka allah lebih mengetahui tentang keimanan mereka maka jika kamu telah mengetahui bahwa mereka benar benar beriman maka janganlah kamu kembalikan mereka kepada suami suami mereka orang orang kafir mereka tiada halal bagi orang orang kafir itu dan orang orang kafir itu tiada halal pula bagi mereka

2233601 telah dila nati orang orang kafir dari bani israil dengan lisan daud dan isa putera maryam yang demikian itu disebabkan mereka durhaka dan selalu melampaui batas
2233602 orang orang kafir yakni ahli kitab dan orang orang musyrik mengatakan bahwa mereka tidak akan meninggalkan agamanya sebelum datang kepada mereka bukti yang nyata yaitu seorang rasul dari allah muhammad yang membacakan lembaran lembaran yang disucikan al quran di dalamnya terdapat isi kitab kitab yang lurus dan tidaklah berpecah belah orang orang yang didatangkan al kitab kepada mereka melainkan sesudah datang kepada mereka bukti yang nyata padahal mereka tidak disuruh kecuali supaya menyembah allah dengan memurnikan keta atan kepada nya dalam menjalankan agama dengan lurus dan supaya mereka mendirikan shalat dan menunaikan zakat dan yang demikian itulah agama yang lurus sesungguhnya orang orang kafir yakni ahli kitab dan orang orang musyrik akan masuk ke neraka jahannam mereka kekal di dalamnya mereka itu adalah seburuk buruk makhluk

2233746 i was on stage with dave harris and ken hamm dave kay sp at some point we kinda looked up at each other like this is a trip none of us were playing in the same open tuning we were all trying to play songs for each other we all hit it off right away and continue to cross paths
2233747 it wasnt like the musical renaissance of today where you can get anything
2233748 i remember as late as 1977 having a car that only had an am radio so i always tuned in to it i drove a lot on sundays and i remember these holy roller shows that seemed to merge from the sacred to the profane over the course of the programme at least as far as how the grooves went
2233749 music to some degree has always been a commodity but we didnt necessarily see the music itself as a commodity now and it isnt just music everything is for sale everybody seems more interested in how its marketed than the music itself they seem to think that being successful at pop culture is an end and that the achievement of pop cultural status is a single goal then they wonder why their lives are so empty
2233750 i dont know how artistic directors of festivals weed through all the stuff they receive i know how many submissions they get but the submitters are more worried about becoming a star than they are making music most of the time things like youtube get people thinking that thats what they should be doing to get famous like its always been the arts are like a microcosm of whats going on in the world like a mirror
2233751 today everybody just expects that because you want to do something and there is all this information around you can just do it
2233752 its like push a button and its done but have they ever thought about learning a song and playing it all the way through just for the heck of it for the fun of doing it
2233753 i have a friend who works at a small public radio station as a reviewer and dj in germany he and many other performers have said to us as we travel around that there are so many musicians around now too because it is so easy to produce a cd people who figure that the music industry is a good way to participate in pop culture inundate programmers with new product my german friend says that he has boxes and boxes of unsolicited product by there would be singer songwriters he gets rid of hundreds of cds without ever having listened to any of them
2233754 mind you when people tell me they have an independent recording contract i think yo myself
2233755 you can make that product for ten thousand dollars when it used to cost you sixty thousand to do the same thing so wanna be stars are making vanity albums that they have zero hope of ever recreating on stage what these people are deluded by is a pop cultural notion that they should be musicians along with everybody else but thats a whole other kettle of fish for one thing you have to learn some people skills and some stage presentation chops bobby blue closed off the filbert festival singer songwriter category after receiving just about four hundred submissions

2233776 nevertheless i have this against you that you have left your first love

2233778 and i gave her time to repent of her sexual immorality and she did not repent

2233814 iddah adalah hak seorang suami yang menceraikan istrinya sedangkan lelaki yang berzina dengannya statusnya bukan suami melainkan fajir pezina
2233815 al istibra bukan karena hak kehormatan mani lelaki pertama yang menzinainya akan tetapi untuk hak kehormatan mani lelaki yang kedua yang hendak menikahinya karena tidak dibenarkan baginya untuk mengakui seseorang sebagai anaknya dan dinasabkan kepadanya padahal bukan anaknya
2233816 seorang wanita yang khulu2 karena dia bukan wanita yang dicerai dia tidak ber iddah dengan iddah wanita yang dicerai bahkan dia harus melakukan istibra membebaskan rahimnya dan istibra juga disebut iddah maka wanita yang digauli dengan nikah syubhat dan wanita yang berzina lebih utama untuk melakukan istibra
2233817 karena wanita yang berzina bukanlah istri yang ditalak yang wajib untuk melakukan iddah dan tidaklah keadaan wanita berzina melebihi keadaan budak wanita yang harus melakukan istibra sebelum digauli oleh tuannya yang baru padahal seandainya dia telah dihamili oleh bekas tuannya maka anaknya dinasabkan kepada bekas tuannya itu maka wanita yang berzina yang seandainya hamil maka anaknya tidak dinasabkan kepada laki laki yang menzinainya lebih wajib untuk melakukan istibra
2233818 tidak halal bagi seorang lelaki yang beriman kepada allah dan hari akhir untuk menyiramkan air maninya di ladang orang yakni menggauli wanita sabaya yang hamil dan menggauli wanita sabaya yang telah bersuami sampai wanita itu melakukan istibra
2233819 yang hamil tidak boleh digauli sampai melahirkan demikian pula yang tidak hamil sampai haid satu kali
2233820 anak yang lahir untuk pemilik kasur artinya anak yang dilahirkan oleh istri seseorang atau budak wanitanya adalah miliknya dan seorang pezina tidak punya hak pada anak hasil perzinaannya
2233821 boleh bagi seorang lelaki yang menghamili seorang wanita dengan perzinaan untuk menyelamatkan nasab anak itu dengan cara menikahinya dalam keadaan hamil dengan syarat keduanya telah bertaubat dari perzinaan dan diketahui dengan pasti yakin bahwa yang menghamilinya adalah laki laki itu
2233822 yang dimaksud dengan sulthan adalah imam amir atau perwakilannya adapun sekarang urusan perwalian ini dilimpahkan oleh pemerintah kepada petugas khusus
2233823 siapa saja wanita yang menikah tanpa izin dari walinya maka pernikahannya batil dan jika para wali berselisih untuk menikahkannya maka sulthan adalah wali bagi seorang wanita yang tidak punya wali
2233824 hadits ini menunjukkan bahwa sulthan adalah wali bagi seorang wanita yang tidak punya wali dalam pernikahan baik karena memang tidak ada walinya atau walinya ada namun tidak mau menikahkannya7
2233825 they got the timely hit in the ninth inning and thats the name of the game
2233826 i dont think that either one of us played the game particularly well i imagine that ball was fair by inches louisiana techs go ahead double in the ninth inning and that sometimes will be the difference in a game
2233827 they helped us we got a couple of hits in the first inning but we werent driving the ball
2233828 i dont know if we even had an extra base hit in this game all eight hits were singles but i give their guy credit their guy alan knotts kind of gathered himself and really pitched well then they gave us a left handed look with landon braud and he did a nice job and then the bulldogs closer aaron lorio has obviously got plenty of ammunition at the end
2233829 craig fritsch was every bit the equal of anybody that threw tonight and we needed it
2233830 it was just a timing play and we timed it perfectly
2233831 we caught them off guard and it worked it was actually cool to steal home but it wouldve been a lot better if we wouldve won
2233832 they take some hacks but they were not any different than what we expected
2233833 the biggest thing about being a closer is coming out and throwing strikes and especially with a righty up there
2233834 coming out and walking the first guy is how you dig yourself into holes
2233835 i still dont feel like my slider is there yet but thats no excuse i have other pitches and i do other things besides throw a slider its not on but its a long season and ill have plenty more chances to bounce back
2233836 were just playing games and trying to find ways to win them
2233837 were having to find ways to win right now because were not doing the job on the mound in terms of throwing strikes and were really not swinging the bats with a whole lot of authority up and down the lineup for the most part our defense has been very good weve got way better arms than what we have shown in terms of throwing strikes
2233838 the difference you can feel between two days is crazy
2233839 yesterday i couldnt hit the broad side of a barn and today was just one of those days when i felt good and felt dialed in he gave me a pitch that i could handle and i took care of it
2233840 theres a little bit of uncertainty at the end of the game with whos going to do what and when
2233841 there is no dialing up three strikeouts i wouldve been just fine with erik forestiere finishing the game he should have mace thurman should have that didnt happen so we moved on to the next guy
2233842 nicks cassavechia not nick right now and i dont think thats a secret but hes still pretty good
2233843 hes got big time heart hes got big time guts and composure and i would not have put him out there if i didnt think that he was the guy to get the job done ive seen him win some games in some pretty unbelievable situations that were much more unbelievable than tonight
2233844 no matter who is on the mound its not really too calm when its the top of the ninth and the bases are loaded with a couple of outs
2233845 theres not really anybody else that wed rather have out there than nick cassavechia nicks proven himself day in and day out

2233848 few believing christians yet realize for few scholar are yet adminitting how many important doctrines are doe to be change radically and how many others should eventually be eliminated when the scroll are properly recognized and evaluated in relation to the new testament the very vulnerable doctrine of the holly spirit will have to go as we shall see and will take with it inevitably the doctrine of the trinity which was never in the bible anyway
2233849 the cappadocians were also anxious to develop the notion of the holy spirit which they fe t have been dealt with very perfunctorily at nicea and we believe in the holy spirit seemed to have been added to athanasiuss creed almost as an after thought people were confused about the holy spirit was it simply a synonym for god ar was it something more some have conceived the holy spirit as an activity noted gregory of nazianzus some as a creature some as god and some have been uncertain what to call him
2233850 christian theologian the great athanasius himself has candidly confessed that whenever he forced his understanding to mediate on the divinity of the logos his toilsome and unavailing efforts recoiled on themselves that the more he thought the less he comprehend and the more he wrote the less capable was he expressing his thought
2233851 god is one god is three since there is nothing like this in creation we cannot understand it but anly accept it
2233852 for 1 am not seeking to understand in order to believe but 1 believe in order that 1 may understand
2233853 the correct order is to believe the deep thing of christian faith before undertaking to discuss them by reason so that even though 1 totally unable to understand it nothing could shake the constancy of my belief
2233854 the three most powerful of the ultra tradition alist movement within the catholic church engage in secret initiation ceremonies brainwashing techniques involving ego destruction moral and spiritual intimidation and highly questionable even dangerous psychtherapeutic practices

2233878 as far as tonights game i think texas a amp m won the game
2233879 they hit big shots and played very well josh carter hit big shots donald sloan hit big shots and the interior did a great job defensively i think we wanted to win so bad for our seniors that you either play great or you come out and play tight
2233880 i think we came out and played tight obviously with their interior defense we needed to hit some outside shots we had some good looks early and we didnt make those their outside defense was very good
2233881 physical and half court basketball favors them texas a amp m
2233882 again i thought it was a bit different than the first time we played give texas a amp m coach mark turgeon the credit for doing a great job controlling the tempo and getting the style of play that they wanted
2233883 i thought early we had some good looks and as the game went on we started to press a little bit more and then we took some tougher looks
2233884 early on i thought cj curtis jerrells had a couple of good looks and i know lace lacedarius dunn had a good look it was a situation where we didnt get off to a good start after that we tried to go inside more and they did a good job defensively
2233885 that is what coach scott drew preaches to us he just tells us to push the tempo up and get it into our style of game but i think they texas a amp m did a good job of slowing it down getting inside and doing what they do
2233886 we had a game like that not too long ago with shots not falling in the first half we know that we just have to stick with what we do and what has got us here eventually they are going to fall but tonight was just one of those nights in which they didnt
2233887 they have good big men down low they like to bang a lot that is the style they play so we are used to it they are one of the most physical teams in the big 12
2233888 i think they just keyed in on us and locked down a bit more they did a great job defensively on us obviously look at the stat sheet
2233889 it was a tough night tonight we didnt shoot like we normally do
2233890 we play with these guards every day we know that they can make those shots we just didnt hit shots tonight and sometimes that just happens tonight was just one of those nights
2233891 it was pretty physical that is the big 12 every game is physical but this one against texas a amp m was the most physical game this year
2233892 i did not like it sloans final dunk as time ran out
2233893 the arena was already hostile they were throwing bottles all over the place which was ridiculous i wish he would have just let the clock go out the game was over

2234078 this is something that we set out to do all season we felt like we worked hard enough to do it and it just came down to that last spot we just had to have faith so we just want to thank god
2234079 i think i lost my voice in all of the screaming and the excitement so i apologize for that
2234080 i also want to echo cjs curtis jerrells thoughts about thanking the lord for helping us get to this situation being the 65
2234081 when you put in perspective it is the second time baylor has been to the ncaa tournament in 58 years so it has been a long time coming being able to progress this far as we have in such a short time is just a tribute to the players that we brought in the school administration and the community that has been able to support us over this time
2234082 it wasnt the performance that we wanted but at the same time i think this team has accomplished a tremendous amount this year
2234083 its something that hopefully they can be proud of the rest of their lives
2234084 in the second half we thought we were coming back
2234085 we had all season long but we just couldnt come back against purdue
2234086 i think the taste in our mouth will be a whole lot better next year and well actually guard somebody
2234087 when i first got here thinking of days like this and thinking about going to the tournament wasnt even in the picture
2234088 i think it is just a testament to this program the coaching staff and the people that they brought in were fighters and we are going to keep fighting
2234089 you count us out we are going to show up on a board on the ncaa tournament sooner or later and that is what we did it is just a credit to those guys credit to the staff and everybody that has something to do with the baylor basketball program

2234103 i wanted to split the game up between tim matthews and craig fritsch
2234104 i wanted to give craig an opportunity to start a game and to get his feet wet like that but ive seen him better
2234105 he wasnt as good tonight as what weve seen that experience and that extended look out there will help him tim has a lot of experience and has done everything he did a good job
2234106 his stuff was better his velocity was better and he was sharper thats a good feeling for him all of this stuff is just about confidence and you cant do anything without it
2234107 some of the things that have gone against him and some of the bad games hes had obviously theyve taken a toll on him mentally from a hitters perspective the whole weekend took a toll on us so tonight was a good opportunity to get well in terms of confidence
2234108 we take nothing away from the missouri staff because they threw us really well and thats a place where you dont want to go when youre not on your a game
2234109 after the weekend we had to come out here and jump out to a 4 0 lead in the first inning you could see it in the dugout that everybodys shoulders dropped a little bit and everybody relaxed and started having more fun
2234110 the whole problem ive had has been pitch selection in the last couple of weekend i havent been swinging the bat too well and id been going out of the zone and trying to make something happen instead of just letting it happen i told myself today that i was just going to make them throw strikes before i started swinging and i got a few i could handle
2234111 hes just got some pop and when he gets the ball up in the air like he does it can blow out of the park on a night like tonight it was good to see him swing the bat better after the weekend he had hell sleep a little better tonight
2234112 it was definitely a big improvement from the weekend it was good to see us start driving some balls again and putting up runs
2234113 in the first inning we put up four runs so it was good to see that early
2234114 at missouri we had the chance to score early twice and we didnt so its good to see us get on the board and keep getting on the board it definitely helped us relax a little more once we put up four in the first and then we scored in every inning except for two so it was good to see
2234115 thats pretty much my thing throwing the sinker and just going right after guys without trying to be too fine its been working out
2234116 im pretty much a groundball pitcher and throwing a two seamer down in the zone is usually pretty good on a night like this
2234117 keeping the ball out of the air is always good and usually i do a pretty good job of keeping the ball out of the air nights like this dont worry me too much but if you do get it up its one of those nights that can be dangerous if you just try to keep it down and induce groundballs it usually works out
2234118 this wouldve been a tough night had we come out here and had the wind blowing in our faces after this weekend
2234119 the hitters needed a night that at the least didnt work against them and this one definitely worked for them we had some guys that took some good at bats and we made some good contact

2234261 the lord is compassionate and gracious slow to anger abounding in love he will not always accuse nor will he harbor his anger forever he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities for as high as the heavens are above the earth so great is his love for those who fear him
2234262 he will not let your foot slip he who watches over you will not slumber indeed he who watches over israel will neither slumber nor sleep the lord watches over you the lord is your shade at your right hand the sun will not harm you by day nor the moon by night the lord will eep you from all harm he will watch over your life the lord will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore
2234263 the lord is gracious and compassionate slow to anger and rich in love the lord is good to all he has compassion on all he has made
2234264 the lord is faithful to all his promises and loving toward all he has made the lord upholds all those who fall and lifts up all who are bowed down
2234265 the lord delights in those who fear him who put their hope in his unfailing love
2234266 for the lord takes delight in his people he crowns the humble with salvation
2234267 because the lord disciplines those he loves as a father the son he delights in
2234268 he tends his flock like a shepherd he gathers the lams in his arms and carries them close to his heart he gently leads those that have young
2234269 he gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak
2234270 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through him
2234271 for he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the son he loves in whom we have redemption the forgiveness of sins

2234279 but i need you on this side of the veil there are many souls who suffer from depression and who are in search of the pure love of christ will you assist me in creating a place of refuge for these women and children
2234280 who would listen to an lds woman who has been married as many times as i have been i have been married almost as many times as the woman at the well
2234281 oh that i were an angel and could have the wish of my heart that i might go forth and speak
2234282 i was just driving by the point of the mountain when i felt the strongest impression whisper dont forget us karyn the women at the point of the mountain need you to come and sing to them the songs of the atoning love of the savior
2234283 can you find out who we should ask to come and sing to them
2234284 ill find out who the relief society president is and do my homework and then ill get back in touch with you
2234285 who will listen to a woman who has been married as many times as i have and who does not have the perfect mormon family
2234286 could the woman at the well have also wondered as i did the day that i poured out my heart in prayer
2234287 oh if i were an angel and could cry repentance unto every people
2234288 never will i drive past the point of the mountain
2234289 the turning point of the mountain this can be a sacred time to get to know who you truly are and to come to an even deepening understanding of the lords atonement

2234293 well what are four boys such as yerselves doin out here
2234294 ye escaped from a slave ship four boys all on their own
2234295 we may be just four boys but i happen to be a fair swordsman
2234296 my name is syd this is my little brother billy and my other brothers teck and ryder
2234297 i was sick as a child my voice will always be high
2234298 at least well get to imagine theres a gal on board

2234300 ye can fight me sword fight as i see that little bit o metal about yer waist and if you can unarm me ill let you four aboard my ship as part of the crew but if you fail to unarm me you will be thrown into the brig and used as our next shark feed is it a deal
2234301 ill ask you this once sir and as i am not a part of your crew nor am i your hostage as of yet so i can not be punished for it do i look stupid to you because i am not why would i accept a challange from a seasoned fighter when i meself am more green than grass
2234302 and what about you boy dyou want ta fight a salty old sea captn
2234303 if i lose you may feed me to the sharkies all you like but either way my brothers get a part on the crew a good role none of that ships whore crap that i have heard of and if they wish theyre to be put off at next port just as well off as they came aboard
2234304 how so you get free labor and the only expense is food and a bit of ale every meal time and the only thing your men miss out on is the company of an extra mans bum

2234313 alright lets get out of here before someone get curious
2234314 kata kataku akan memudar laksana jejak kakimu di atas pasir
2234315 saya akan berikan petunjuk padamu di jalan hidupmu engkau akan menemui 3 pintu
2234316 karena di dunia ini ada hal hal yang aku sukai dan ada pula hal hal yang tak kusukai aku akan mengubahnya agar sesuai keinginanku
2234317 aku belajar bagaimana membedakan apa yang dapat klakukan dengan kekuatanku dan apa yang di luar kemampuanku apa yang tergantung padaku dan apa yang tidak tergantung padaku
2234318 bagus gunakan kekuatanmu sesuai kemampuanmu lupakan apa yang diluar kekuatanmu apa yang engkau tak sanggup mengubahnya
2234319 orang orang di sekitarku adalah sumber kesenangan kebahagiaan tetapi mereka juga yang mendatangkan derita kepahitan dan frustrasi
2234320 saya belajar bahwa mereka bukanlah sumber dari kegembiraan atau kedukaanku keberhasilan atau kegagalanku mereka hanya memberikan kesempatan agar hal hal tersebut dapat muncul sebenarnya di dalam dirikulah segala hal tersebut berakar
2234321 apa yang mereka bangkitkan dari dirimu sebenarnya mereka mengenalkan engkau pada dirimu sendiri bersyukurlah pada mereka yang telah membuatmu senang amp bahagia dan bersyukur pula pada mereka yang menyebabkan derita dan frustrasi karena melalui mereka lah kehidupan mengajarkanmu apa yang perlu engkau kuasai dan jalan apa yang harus kau tempuh
2234322 jika memang diriku sendiri lah sumber dari segala problemku memang disanalah aku harus mengubahnya
2234323 aku belajar bahwa ada hal hal di dalam diriku yang bisa ditingkatkan dan ada yang tidak bisa saya ubah
2234324 tapi saya mulai lelah untuk bertarung melawan dunia melawan setiap orang dan melawan diri sendiri tidakkah ada akhir dari semuai ini kapan saya bisa tenang saya ingin berhenti bertarung ingin menyerah ingin meninggalkan semua ini
2234325 aku belajar bahwa membenci dan menolak sebagian dari diriku sendiri sama saja dengan mengutuk untuk tidak pernah berdamai dengan diri sendiri aku belajar untuk menerima diriku seutuhnya secara total dan tanpa syarat
2234326 bahwa dengan berdamai dengan diriku aku tak punya sesuatupun untuk dipersalahkan pada orang lain tak sesuatupun yg perlu ditakutkan dari merela
2234327 if there were momentum to bring back the orchestra we probably would not have come
2234328 it makes the point that there is no orchestra here
2234329 to provide some symphonic music while we have no symphony of our own
2234330 as a regional orchestra the jacksonville symphony is able to serve outlying communities
2234331 increasing numbers of savannah residents have been traveling to jacksonville so we are very pleased to be welcomed into the community
2234332 its a good opportunity for us to play for a new audience
2234333 its the result of not being able to afford our own symphony
2234334 while you can get good concerts from a visiting orchestra most communities want more from their orchestras than just performances
2234335 how much impact does the jacksonville symphony have after the concert is over
2234336 we have to ask ourselves do we want to rent or do we want to own classical music
2234337 i just think that a local resident orchestra adds to the lifestyle of the city
2234338 these are educated people who teach our children and play in our churches we miss musicians living in this city
2234339 it appears that theres a misunderstanding a sort of generalization over many things that we believe is our duty to clear up for them
2234340 we want the whole world to understand we are no kind of racist
2234341 the thing that you need to be sure of is that were going where were going to go please give me the right to state who i am basically
2234342 discriminatory statement the charter of rights gives every individual the freedom to live and act and wear whatever he wants
2234343 what we have seen in the herouxville declaration is symptomatic of a dangerous trend in quebec and canada that could set multicultural progress back generations
2234344 most of the people who turned up to greet the women didnt know what to expect so they were pretty reserved at first
2234345 but once most realized that the women were there to simply voice their concerns and explain islamic culture most happily listened
2234346 i think its reflective of the fact that canada is actually fracturing into two nations
2234347 i asked myself how is it that these people can ask for such things and the only possible answer is that these people do not know who we are
2234348 one of these days you will have many divided groups in canada and groups in canada or groups in any country doesnt make a country
2234349 we need them and we want them and we also want them to have made the correct choice for them
2234350 im not a racist but at a certain point were all going to end up that way
2234351 if we travel abroad we try to adapt to their way of life

2234365 listen to me you and that little critter get off my property before i call the police
2234366 were leaving but dont think our parents and the school board wont hear about this and just for your information the north won the war
2234367 and the next time you see him i would advise apologizing or you can just watch your own child from now on because i wont be doing it
2234368 those things he said were not true at all do you understand me

2234376 well mr mcadams i must say that for an imaginary girl she gets around i saw her macking with colby the other day and we all know thats a breeding ground for stds
2234377 well i must say this is a different turn out from what i expected folks it seems jimmy matters not only has imaginary stds but is macking on colbys leftovers what do you have to say for yourself mr matters
2234378 she told me she was in less then nice terms unsatisfied by colby and that if his kissing was a preview of what was to come she was staying std free for a while
2234379 do you have anything to say in response colby is it

2234387 is it possible that humans have a design flaw not ironed out by evolution that leaves us with unpredictable and insatiable desire
2234388 what lures us into the future is the renewal of appetite having noticed that ones appetite is what vitalises one there could easily be the desire to frustrate onself the project might be to keep appetite alive the problem is that consumer capitalism exploits this because what it does by pretending to offer choice is that it pre empts you finding out that you want its like the way pornography steals peoples dreams it gives you pictures of sex scenarios and so unlike more imaginative forms of literature stops you creating your dreams what i want to show peopl is that one has a hunger to have ones imagination pre empted like that because working out what one wants is quite difficult quite naked

2234564 de flytter rundt p ord fra deres rigtige pladser og glemmer og udelader en stor del af det budskab de har modtaget
2234565 og fordi de br d deres pagt har vi forbandet dem og gjort deres hjerter h rde de ndrede ord fra deres kontekst og de negligerede en del af det budskab de fik p mindelse om
2234566 ndrede p teksten og glemte en god del af budskabet
2234567 flyttet ordene fra deres rigtige pladser og glemt en god del af budskabet
2234568 ndret ord fra deres kontekst og negligeret en del af det budskab de blev p mindet om
2234569 ndrede ord fra deres kontekst og negligerede en del af budskabet
2234570 det er ligegyldigt hvad du tror bare du tror vi tilbeder alle den samme gud og der er mange veje til ham
2234571 ogs med dem der kalder sig kristne lavede vi en pagt men de glemte og forlod en god del af budskabet s vi st dte dem fra os opildnede til fjendskab og had iblandt dem indtil dommedag snart vil allah vise dem hvad de har gjort
2234572 h i bogens folk der er kommet til jer vores apostel der benbarer meget af det i har haft for vane at skjule i jeres skrift der er kommet til jer fra allah et nyt lys muhammad og en klar bog koranen
2234573 de er i sandhed vantro som siger messias s n af maria er gud

2234575 sig h muhammad hvem har s mindst magt imod allah hvis det var hans vilje at udslette kristus frelseren s n af maria hans mor og alle andre p jorden
2234576 j derne og de kristne siger vi er allahs s nner og hans elskede
2234577 straffen for dem der bekriger allah og hans budbringer og tilstr ber korruption og opildner til uenighed i landet de der afviser at underkaste sig islam er mord henrettelse korsf stelse afhugning af h nder og f dder p modsatte sider eller de bliver f ngslet det er deres fornedrelse og van re i denne verden og en grum sk bne venter dem i det hinsidige
2234578 undtaget er dem der angrer og bliver muslimer f r i besejrer dem og de falder i jeres magt i det tilf lde skal i vide at allah er tilgivende barmhjertig
2234579 troende frygt allah og s g vejen til ham k mp h rdt jihad for hans sag bedrag d d og ford mmelse s vil i f succes hvad ang r de vantro tidligere defineret som kristne om de s havde al verdens rigdomme to gange til at betale som l sepenge for straffen p dommedag s vil det aldrig blive accepteret de vil lide en smertefuld tortur de vil nske de kunne komme ud af ilden men det kommer de ikke de skal have en evig straf
2234580 om jeg s taler med menneskers og engles tunger men ikke har k rlighed er jeg et rungende malm og en klingende bj lde og om jeg s har profetisk gave og kender alle hemmeligheder og ejer al kundskab og har al tro s jeg kan flytte bjerge men ikke har k rlighed er jeg intet og om jeg s uddeler alt hvad jeg ejer og giver mit legeme hen til at br ndes men ikke har k rlighed gavner det mig intet k rligheden er t lmodig k rligheden er mild den misunder ikke k rligheden praler ikke bilder sig ikke noget ind den g r intet us mmeligt s ger ikke sit eget hidser sig ikke op b rer ikke nag den finder ikke sin gl de i uretten men gl der sig ved sandheden den t ler alt tror alt h ber alt udholder alt k rligheden h rer aldrig op
2234581 de kristne vantro vil l nges efter at slippe ud af ilden men det vil aldrig ske de skal have en evig tortur
2234582 hvad ang r tyven mand eller kvinde hug hans eller hendes h nder af en eksemplarisk straf fra allah allah er m gtig klog af en sten at v re men hvis tyven angrer efter sin forbrydelse og forbedrer sin opf rsel vil allah tilgive ham
2234583 budbringer lad ikke dem der afviser og forh ner volde dig smerte de har travlt med at henfalde til vantro de siger vi tror men deres hjerter har ingen tro
2234584 og blandt j derne findes der m nd der vil lytte til enhver l gn de ndrer p ordenes kontekst fra deres rigtige tid og sted
2234585 de siger hvis i modtager dette s tag det men hvis ikke s pas p hvis nogens fristelse er frembragt af allahs nsker s kan i ikke ndre p det det er s ikke allahs vilje at rense deres hjerter de bliver van ret i denne verden og i det hinsidige straffet h rdt
2234586 allah nsker ikke at de skal kende sandheden fordi det er hans agt at van re dem og s torturere dem
2234587 de er glade for at lytte til l gne glade for at indtage alt der er forbudt de er gr dige efter uretm ssige gevinster
2234588 det var os der benbarede toraen til moses i den var der vejledning og lys som profeterne brugte til at d mme j derne og profeterne b jede sig for allahs vilje i underkastelse rabbinerne og pr sterne blev betroet at passe p allahs skriftbog og de bevidnede den frygt derfor ikke mennesker men frygt mig og s lg ikke mine benbaringer for en ussel pris
2234589 og i deres fodspor sendte vi jesus s n af maria for at bekr fte den lov der var kommet f r ham vi sendte ham evangeliet deri var der vejledning og lys og bekr ftelse af loven der var kommet f r ham en vejledning til dem der frygter allah
2234590 lad evangeliets folk bed mme hvad allah har benbaret deri hvis nogen ikke d mmer efter hvad allah har benbaret s er de ikke bedre end dem der er p afveje
2234591 til dig muhammad sendte vi i sandhed skriften der bekr ftede det skrift der kom f r det og passede godt p det s d m imellem dem ud fra hvad allah har benbaret
2234592 og dette beordrer han d m imellem dem ud fra hvad allah har benbaret og f lg ikke deres kristne nsker men v r p vagt over for dem da de ellers vil narre jer lokke jer v k fra det allah har sendt jer
2234593 troende tag ikke j der og kristne som venner de er kun hinandens venner og beskyttere

2234622 alif lam min disse bogstaver er et mirakel fra koranen og kun allah ved hvad de betyder dette er bogen fri for tvivl en vejledning til dem der afv rger det onde som tror p det ukendte opfylder deres tilbedelsesforpligtelser og betaler zakat af det vi har forsynet dem med
2234623 enhver der tror p koran og sunna der er blevet nedsendt til dig muhammad og p det der blev sendt til dem f r din tid toraen og evangelierne og tror fast p det hinsidige
2234624 med hensyn til de vantro s er det ligegyldigt om du advarer dem eller ej de vil ikke tro allah har forseglet deres hjerter og deres h relse og tild kket deres jne der venter dem en frygtelig straf
2234625 de bedrager allah og dem der tror men de bedrager bare sig selv uden at forst det i deres hjerter er en sygdom og allah har forv rret deres sygdom der venter dem en frygtelig straf fordi de l j
2234626 n r man siger til dem skab ikke ford rv p jorden
2234627 allah h ner dem betaler dem tilbage og for ger deres forbrydelser s at de t ger rundt i blinde
2234628 de er dem der har byttet vejledning med fejltagelse og ikke f et noget ud af handlen
2234629 de er dem der har k bt fejltagelse for vejledningens pris s de vil intet f ud af deres handel
2234630 de er ligesom ham der havde t ndt et b l da det br ndte omkring ham fjernede allah lyset fra dem og efterlod dem i m rke s de intet kunne se de er d ve dumme og blinde s de omvender sig ikke eller som en storm med m rke torden og lyn i d dsangst stikker de fingrene i rerne men allah omslutter de vantro lynene bl nder dem n r m rket omslutter dem st r de stille og hvis det passede allah kunne han ogs fratage dem deres h relse
2234631 hvis i tvivler p det vi har benbaret for vores gudfrygtige tjener s bring en sura magen til denne s kald p alle de vidner i har bortset fra allah men det kan i ikke ligesom i heller ikke kan beskytte jer mod helvedes ild der n res af mennesker og sten og som er forberedt for de vantro
2234632 de der afviser og ben gter vores tegn vil blive helvedesildens indv nere i al evighed
2234633 h israels b rn husk de begunstigelser jeg tilstod jer s overhold jeres pagt med mig s vil jeg ogs overholde min pagt med jer frygt mig og tro p hvad jeg har benbaret som bekr fter og verificerer det skrift i allerede ejer
2234634 v r ikke den f rste til at ben gte eller s lge mine vers for en ussel pris og frygt mig og mig alene
2234635 skil jer ikke af med mine benbaringer for en s lle profit
2234636 sammenbland ikke sandhed og l gn og skjul ikke sandheden n r i kender den
2234637 udf r b n betal zakat skat fald p kn sammen med de lydige l s recit r og stud r skriftet hvorfor forst r i det ikke hvorfor overgiver i jer ikke s g islamisk p kn b n det er i sandhed h rdt og kr vende undtagen for dem der underkaster sig og adlyder
2234638 bliv muslimer og underkast jer mine betingelser fordi jeg vil have kontrol over jer og jeg beg rer jeres penge
2234639 husk israels b rn de begunstigelser jeg tilstod jer og hvordan jeg fremh vede jer over alverdens folkeslag foretrak jer frem for alle andre
2234640 de j diske syndere ndrede og perverterede de ord der var blevet dem benbaret til et forvansket ord s p grund af deres synder sendte vi dem en plage fra himlen
2234641 allahs apostel sagde plagen var et torturmiddel nedsendt over israelerne
2234642 fornedrelse og elendighed blev j dernes lod og de blev hjems gt af allahs vrede det var fordi de ikke troede p allahs tegn og vers og fordi de dr bte profeterne de var ulydige og rebelske de der tror og j der og nazarenere kristne og sabeanerne zoroastrianere enhver der tror p allah og dommedag og enhver der handler ret vil blive bel nnet hos deres herre og de beh ver ikke frygte eller fortryde
2234643 men i j der vendte jer bort og var fortabte i ved at i br d sabbatens ukr nkelighed s vi sagde bliv aber foragtede og hadede vi uddelte denne straf som et eksempel og en advarsel til dem der frygter allah
2234644 profeten sagde vi muslimer er de sidste der skal komme men vi vil v re de f rende
2234645 men ve j derne der forfalsker skrifterne og siger dette er fra gud s at de kan tjene penge p den m de
2234646 alligevel siger de j der ilden vil ikke r re os i mere end nogle f dage men de er indkapslet i fejltagelser og vil blive indsat i helvede
2234647 betal zakat skat af jeres velstand til gavn for andre muslimer og husk vi sluttede pagt med jer dr b ikke hinanden fordriv ikke mennesker fra deres hjem det lovede i og aflagde vidnesbyrd men i dr ber hinanden kalder mennesker skyldige og bruger undertrykkelse n r i tager fanger tager i l sepenge for dem selvom det er forbudt
2234648 tror i j der p en del af bogen og afviser en del der er ingen anden bel nning for dem der handler s dan end van re i verden og p dommedag den v rste straf deres tortur vil aldrig f ende
2234649 bogen koranen blev sendt til dem j derne af allah som en bekr ftelse og bevis p det der allerede var blevet benbaret for dem toraen og evangelierne de havde for vane at bede om sejr over de vantro og sk nt de genkendte det de modtog troede de ikke p det allahs forbandelse over dem der ben gter
2234650 sig muhammad enhver fjende af gabriel b r vide at han bringer den koranen med allahs tilladelse som en bekr ftelse p det der tidligere blev benbaret en vejledning og glade nyheder for dem der tror enhver der er fjende af allah hans engle hans budbringere af gabriel og michael skal vide at allah er de vantros fjende
2234651 vi har nedsendt klare tegn og ingen afviser dem bortset fra dem der er perverse
2234652 da der kom en budbringer fra allah og bekr ftede det de havde i forvejen var der nogle af bogens folk der smed allahs bog v k som om de intet vidste
2234653 de f lger hvad satan messede og meddelte i salomons levetid
2234654 i troende siger ikke til profeten tvetydige ord som h r p os men i taler med respekt og adlyder ham for dem der ikke underkaster sig venter der en grusom straf
2234655 n r vi sletter et vers eller bortkaster det til glemsel erstatter vi det med et bedre
2234656 uanset hvilken benbaring vi abrogerer eller s rger for bliver glemt s erstatter vi det med noget bedre
2234657 en hel del af bogens folk dr mmer i deres selviske misundelse om at de kan omvende jer muslimer til vantro igen efter at i var blevet troende selv efter at sandheden var blevet benlys for dem v r overb rende med dem indtil allah giver sine befalinger
2234658 bed jeres b nner udf r jeres ritualer og betal zakat skat alt det gode i g r vil komme tilbage hos allah allah ser hvad i g r
2234659 de sagde ingen vil komme i paradis medmindre han er j de eller kristen s dan er deres nsket nkning sig bevis det hvis i taler sandt nej sagde den tolerante religion enhver der overgiver sig til allah og underkaster sig vil f sin bel nning det beh ver ingen at frygte eller s rge over j derne siger de kristne f lger ingenting og de kristne siger j derne f lger ingenting alligevel l ser de det samme skrift men allah vil d mme imellem dem
2234660 og hvem er mere uretf rdig end ham der forbyder allahs navn at blive fejret og n vnt i de hellige lokaler mosk og str ber efter at nedrive dem det var ikke passende at den slags m nd skulle komme der undtagen i frygt for dem er der intet andet end van re i denne verden og i den n ste venter der dem den v rste straf en frygtelig ulykke
2234661 terrorisme er retf rdiggjort fordi mekkanerne jog mig ud af allahs hus
2234662 de siger allah har avlet en s n lovet v re han nej ham tilh rer alt i himlen og p jorden alle er underdanige og lydige over for ham
2234663 ham skyldes alt oprindeligt i himlene og p jorden n r han beslutter en sag siger han bliv til og s bliver det til
2234664 og dette var arven abraham efterlod til sine s nner og det gjorde jacob ogs h mine s nner
2234665 t berne blandt menneskene vil sige hvad har f et dem til at v lge en anden bederetning end den de havde f r sig st og vest tilh rer allah alene han vejleder hvem han vil p den rette vej s ledes har vi gjort jer til et retf rdigt f llesskab for at i kan v re vidner over for menneskene og at budbringeren kan v re et vidne over for jer og den tidligere bederetning indstiftede vi kun for at finde ud af hvem der f lger budbringeren og hvem der vender om p h len
2234666 j derne har afvist vores fup p stande s vi vil ikke lege med dem mere
2234667 i denne periode begyndte en ny type muslim at opst kaldet munafiqin eller hykler de bekendte sig til islam men var ikke klar til at vedst konsekvenserne nogle var indtr dt i den muslimske fold med det ene form l at skade den indefra
2234668 vi vedtog kun den tidligere bederetning for at vi kunne finde ud af hvem der f lger budbringeren og hvem der vender om p h len og ikke underkaster sig
2234669 det var i sandhed en h rd pr ve undtagen for dem allah har vejledt og allah havde ikke til hensigt at g re jeres tro frugtesl s og g til spilde allah er i sandhed barmhjertig
2234670 vi ser det sp rgende udtryk i jeres ansigter nu skal vi anvise jer en bederetning i vil blive tilfredse med drej jeres ansigter i retning mod den hellige mosk i mekka uanset hvor i er skal i dreje ansigtet i den retning bogens folk j der og kristne ved udm rket at kaabaen er sandheden fra deres herre ej heller er allah uvidende om hvad de g r
2234671 om du s fremlagde alle tegnene for bogens folk s ville de ikke f lge din bederetning ej heller skal i f lge deres bederetning ligesom de heller ikke vil f lge hinandens bederetninger
2234672 hvis i efter at i har f et viden valgte at f lge deres nsket nkning s ville i sandelig v re p afveje
2234673 bogens folk hvem vi gav skriftet kender genkender denne benbaring ham som de kender genkender deres egne s nner men nogle af dem skjuler bevidst sandheden
2234674 de vantro minder om en der r ber til en der ikke kan h re de er d ve stumme og blinde de giver ingen mening
2234675 de der skjuler allahs benbaringer i skriftbogen bibelen og s ledes scorer en ussel profit ved at s lge den til muhammad f r ilden som bel nning allah vil ikke henvende sig til dem de vil f en forf rdelig dom
2234676 de er dem der bortbyttede vejledning for fejltagelser og tortur for tilgivelse hvor modigt s ger de ilden deres dom afsiges fordi allah nedsendte den sande bog men de der s ger anledninger til splid i bogen er h rde modstandere
2234677 fromhed er ikke om man vender ansigtet mod st eller vest fromhed er om man tror p allah og dommedag englene bogen og profeterne at man med gl de giver ud af sine rigdomme til sl gtninge for ldrel se de vejfarende muhammads lejetropper dem der beder om det og til at l sk be fanger at v re urokkelig med hensyn til gudsdyrkelsens forpligtelser og at betale zakat skat

2234679 ramadanen er den m ned hvor koranen blev nedsendt som en vejledning til menneskeheden tilligemed klare beviser tegn til vejledning og kriterier for godt og forkert s alle der er til stede derhjemme skal faste i den m ned
2234680 og i skal g re allah st rre sig allahu akbar allah er st rre
2234681 de sp rger jer om de nye m ner sig de er bare tegn p fastsatte rstider for menneskene og p hajj pilgrimsf rd
2234682 k mp for allahs sag mod dem der bekriger jer men overdriv ikke for allah kan ikke lide dem der overdriver
2234683 og dr b dem hvorend i finder og fanger dem og bortjag dem derfra hvor de bortjog jer for al fitnah polyteisme vantro undertrykkelse fristelse til frafald er v rre end nedslagtning
2234684 k mp ikke med dem i den hellige mosk undtagen de bek mper jer d r men hvis de bek mper jer s dr b dem det er bel nningen til de vantro
2234685 men hvis de holder inde afst r fra er allah tilgivende barmhjertig
2234686 og bek mp dem indtil der ikke mere findes vantro og religion kun er for allah men hvis de holder inde afst r fra s lad der ikke v re mere fjendskab bortset fra imod vantro syndere
2234687 den forbudte m ned for den forbudte m ned og for alt forbudt g lder geng ldelsens lov hvis nogen overskrider forbudet mod jer skal i p lignende vis overskride mod ham men frygt allah og vid at allah er med de fromme

2234689 den hellige m ned for den hellige m ned og alle hellige ting giver geng ld enhver der handler aggressivt imod jer skal p f res tilsvarende skade af jer til geng ld
2234690 den hedenske m ned er vigtig fordi jeg er en hedensk gud men jeg tilst r muhammad en s rtilladelse fordi jeg er lige som ham
2234691 brug af jeres velstand for allahs sag kamp mod de vantro og bortkast ikke jer selv til fortabelse g r det gode allah elsker dem der g r det gode
2234692 p den foreskrevne m de if lge profetens sunna at foretage hajj eller umrah ved at bes ge mekka for allah men hvis i er forhindret s send de gaver i har r d til dvs hvis i ikke kan komme og k mpe s send penge s andre kan k mpe og barber ikke jeres hoveder f r offergaven er ankommet til offerstedet frygt allah hans straf er streng
2234693 de sp rger jer hvad de skal spendere sig alt i spenderer er godt allah ved besked om det
2234694 jihad hellig krig for allahs sag er foreskrevet for jer muslimer selvom i m ske hader det men det er muligt at i hader noget der er godt for jer og kan lide noget der er d rligt for jer men allah ved det og i ved det ikke
2234695 krigsf relse er obligatorisk for jer selvom i m ske hader det
2234696 de sp rger dig ang ende kamp i den hellige m ned sig kamp i den hellige m ned er en alvorlig sag men at forhindre adgang til allah at forn gte ham at forhindre adgang til den hellige mosk at uddrive dens medlemmer samt polyteisme er v rre end drab de vil heller ikke holde op med at bek mpe jer f r det lykkes dem at f jer til at forlade jeres religion hvis nogen af jer vender om og d r som vantro vil alle jeres gerninger v re tabt og i vil ryge i helvede de der tror og rejser hjemmefra for at k mpe for allahs sag vil sandelig have h bet om allahs barmhjertighed

2234883 literacy is only dangerous among the working class when it is used to further working class interests schooling could be used by the upper class to get control of the children of the poor they could turn working class literacy into a tool to protect the status quo literacy could domesticate the poor rather than rile them up

2234894 again im not sure conveniently classifying someone an unlawful enemy combatant automatically makes their imprisonment justifiable the number of prisoners at gitmo who have been quietly released about 40 of those originally imprisoned through 2006 without charges or even comment makes me suspect there was more than a little random detention

2234904 it is the oil of this century not a question

2234917 basically these fake dealers are trying to take advantage of your desire to get a bargain and while every business recognizes the need to try and cut costs you cant do it by buying counterfeit equipment
2234918 the quality of counterfeiting has certainly gone up in recent years as theyre really getting very good at this
2234919 its not just the hardware itself but even the boxes the labeling and the holograms on the packaging are being accurately duplicated so its a constant education process for the dealers and we have to share information amongst ourselves
2234920 our members abide by a strict code of ethics to protect our customers from the menace of counterfeiters
2234921 we react quickly to expel any uneda member that is discovered selling stolen or counterfeit gear we also work closely with various law enforcement agencies to identify and prosecute counterfeiters

2234933 we have kids who do well in school who are good athletes and who have dreams were no different from anyone else but no one has seen that
2234934 now we have a square where people can sit and rest just like in franklin square
2234935 we expect more tourism with a square that lends itself to community activities weddings and outdoor concerts
2234936 it will be a draw for chatham county and beyond
2234937 that push has to come from those invested in the community
2234938 if tour buses stop and see the site that would bring a level of interest that shows this community is part of the city not abandoned by it
2234939 rich and poor people people of all faiths people of different economic and educational backgrounds came together and made this happen
2234940 for a city like savannah where communities are still in some cases segregated to push this through is incredible
2234941 creating an art park similar to squares already connecting savannah would help reconnect yamacraw to the rest of savannah
2234942 it was a case study in a worst case scenario that fortunately had a happy ending
2234943 if we focused on high income neighborhoods it would have been quicker but then it wouldnt have been the same project
2234944 it was a public private partnership in a chicken and egg situation
2234945 the chicken was private money that led to a series of other contributions
2234946 we had to find a contractor who could replace the foundation without cracking the walls
2234947 its a citizen project but that doesnt mean they dont need help
2234948 it sat there for some time when people get in touch with us i try to do what i can
2234949 we didnt have the organization to get it done the committee was loosely held together the city was a natural place to look for help
2234950 we dont need to do another project this way again people lost interest after working on it for so long otherwise its a great asset to the community
2234951 we didnt lock our doors it was one big family
2234952 it has something in common with the rest of the city
2234953 putting it in the hands of the cultural affairs commission to keep it alive
2234954 any project that doesnt have an owner is bound to fall into trouble
2234955 i would encourage anyone not to walk away and hope things will be ok they should stay together for a while and get a marketing plan going
2234956 the worst thing that could happen is to have all this work and not follow it up with tours this is the opportunity to have our history told in a way that lets the truth come out

2235004 my mistakes and failings keep me humble they chide me with their blaming voices and pester me with their mocking comments they badger me with their poking fingers of disgrace and condemnation they hound me with the blame and guilt and a thousand other recriminations walk with me through my mistakes and failings let me hear your understanding and merciful voice we both know that i am not a perfect person assure me that i am not a bad person either keep teaching me about myself about life about you through these characteristics i would rather not have remind me that they are my friends not my enemies that they are my teachers not my wardens may i befriend the unwanted parts of myself and continually learn wisdom from them thank you for lovingly embracing me as i am while the murky layers of my shortcomings are slowly transformed into love

2235006 all cultures are equally good except for western culture which is uniquely bad who are we to say that freedom and democracy are any better than tyranny and oppression
2235007 terrorism is the only option of those who are oppressed by the western imperialist capitalists and is perfectly justified
2235008 so called hate crime laws could mean the bible would be considered hate literature and preaching from it would be hate speech because of references to religious teachings on homosexuality or other behaviors the orwellian implications of these types of laws mean bible believing christians could become criminals simply because they spoke out about their beliefs
2235009 law abiding americans became criminals because they exercised a right our forebears fought and died for
2235010 by introducing the anti defamation leagues adl federal hate crime bill into congress for the second time rep jackson lee shows shes bound and determined to stifle your first amendment rights no matter how many times she has to make a run at it
2235011 the constitution party condemns h r 254 as an affront to our liberty today adl inspired thought crime laws are stripping nations of free speech
2235012 in canada and many european countries it is a crime to use the internet to criticize federally protected groups such as homosexuals and muslims in england two men who called islam wicked were indicted under britains hate crime law and now face seven years in prison those horrors do not belong in america
2235013 congresswoman h r 254 is being pushed by the same group adl responsible for the british law that says truth cannot be used as a defense in court only the complaints by members of specially protected groups who say their feelings have been hurt are being allowed the reality of what these types of laws are doing and have done to people across the world should be a chilling reminder to americans to oppose these laws while we still can
2235014 as beautiful as the telfair is the building was getting out of date
2235015 we needed to provide ourselves and our tourists a place where they can see art from all ages
2235016 no one is going to make it more beautiful than the people who live and work here
2235017 jepson knew the way to excite people is to dream of something big and bold and ambitious
2235018 its like pulling a thread from a piece of cloth
2235019 the telfair will be the loser if it builds a new museum that is detested because it violates the town plan
2235020 fails to define an edge and fails to respect the rhythm which has been set by hundreds of years of building tradition
2235021 we werent just throwing this modern building in front of them and demanding they pass it
2235022 we wanted a building that was as important to our time as 19th century buildings are to theirs
2235023 the angles and curves make it difficult to get things lined up
2235024 when the city walks into the building it will see how much it highlights savannah while being contemporary by day it brings the outside in by night its brings the inside out
2235025 the telfair showed that you can build a dynamic building that meets the guidelines
2235026 we need architecture of the now as well as architecture of the past
2235027 now that it is nearly completed there is no question that it fits
2235028 seeing that knight was the spark that lit a fire under me for the arts i hope kids will walk into the new building and have the same kind of experience i did
2235029 these names are so well known in the art world
2235030 the collection is a boon to the museum and to the whole area
2235031 now inner city black youth will have the same opportunities as students at the country day school
2235032 art has the ability to bring people together because it highlights their commonality its the universal language of mankind

2235041 allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
2235042 no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from c i a ever involved in any such effort
2235043 never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbash as outlined in mr suskinds book

2235067 at a public university stepping on a flag even burning an american flag is without question a constitutionally protected act of political protest
2235068 the right to protest is at the very heart of the first amendment and means nothing if only inoffensive expression is permitted
2235069 sfsu has a duty to uphold the first amendment rights of all of its students even if their expressive activity offends the religious sensibilities of some
2235070 to give all parties the confidence that they will be heard and fairly treated by a panel that includes representatives of all the universitys key constituencies
2235071 by continuing this investigation sfsu is not just charting new territory in campus repression but its actions come into direct conflict with the united states constitution the charges against the college republicans must be immediately dismissed
2235072 if you choose a welcoming stance for our new residents imagine a senior center with a gym and health pub and classrooms and craft rooms and meditation rooms and a travel agency and a fine restaurant and as a place to meet up with friends wouldnt it be wonderful to organize local outings like river trips and hiking and day trips to the parks kids and young adults are wonderful to be around but sometimes we like to hang out with others who share our history that is what a senior center could be perfect for it could also be a great place to consolidate helping resources when needs arise

2235083 cool how is it for finding potential candidates who have applied for similar jobs previously
2235084 we can use it if they apply for another position
2235085 if they apply for another position wont they have an updated resume
2235086 is that so we may have a job for them in the denver office because that would be really useful
2235087 no just so they know who applies here we dont do anything with it
2235088 thank you for your application we will keep your resume on file
2235089 im not hiding anything a delay is a delay glass is by far the most interesting

2235110 how can you say that israel must return to the pre 1967 borders does palestine consist only of the west bank and gaza if so
2235111 i am an arab american as well as a fan of
2235112 24 through the years have been arab muslims why well probably because most terrorists today are in fact arab muslims as a descendant of syrian muslims i am very well aware that the majority of muslims world wide are peaceful hard working and law abiding that still does not change the fact that the greatest terrorist threat to the u s today comes not from the eta the ira etc but from one group islamic terrorists

2235114 24 confronts americas worst fears about al qaeda whose goal remains to kill as many americans as possible whenever possible the show is said to be guilty of fueling anti muslim and anti arab prejudice
2235115 well heres the hard cold truth when islamic terrorists stop being a threat to americas survival viewers will lose interest in
2235116 24 because believe it or not the idea that there are jack bauers out there in real life risking their lives to save ours does mean something to me
2235117 24 causing a possible backlash against muslims and arab americans wheres the evidence of that
2235118 the american muslim community is the greatest line of defense against these terrorists
2235119 that said i would certainly welcome more characters in movies tv programs and novels who reflect the overall arab american experience truth is most of us dont have bomb making skills or a desire to become human missiles and there are muslim and arab american ctu heroes out there as well as doctors superdads women scientists etc but just as it took saul bellow to give literary voice to the jewish american experience we need our own storytellers to weave the pastiche of tales that make up arab american life
2235120 in the meantime the next time a journalist decides to report on arab american concerns about shows like
2235121 and maybe that same reporter could take a closer look at cair
2235122 because terrorists and their supporters continue to hide among us in plain sight we need jack bauer now more than ever
2235123 the inside word is that the ftc is going to really turn up the heat in the next several weeks and intends to launch actions against multiple entities which it believes are running incentivized offers without appropriate disclosure industry buzz says that several major companies who have seen tremendous growth from running this sort of offer are being scrutinized and are at risk the legal sands are rapidly shifting for the incentivized portion of our industry if you operate in this space now is the time to make sure that your sites and offers are 100 compliant to the best of your ability after the ftc contacts you its too late and the ftc is going to extract their pint of blood in addition to forcing you to comply

2235188 i was just wishing for a cop to show up and this is the very first time ive seen it come to pass
2235189 this just proves that old adage what comes around goes around and i
2235190 i say we wait until a few more weeks go by and then well kill her
2235191 but we must be very careful to catch her at the most advantageous time no witnesses
2235192 yes the elevator shaft would be the best place to do her in
2235193 theoretically that sounds good but the concrete stairwell would be easier
2235194 the stairwell is not only next to shawns apartment it is always desolate only the workmen go there and theyre never there at night
2235195 since the crone never comes out until night anyway we could shove her down the stairs and no one would ever suspect
2235196 absolutely and the police wouldnt bother to investigate the death of a vicious drug snorting witch anyway if they turned a blind eye to shawns death they certainly wouldnt lift a finger to solve one of a dope fiend

2235203 i just dont understand and theres nothing i can do to help
2235204 i think the mainstream media is right to be cautious with this story
2235205 i think theyre good at what the national enquirer do they make sure their stories are legally airtight but i dont know if that qualifies them to be a source to follow
2235206 thats one of the reasons its news but the national enquirer owns the edwards love child story the way the washington post owned watergate

2235208 kirk had that balance of energizing you but not overwhelming you
2235209 for being a scholar he loved rock music wearing torn jeans and fixing his motorcycle
2235210 he was the most incredible wordsmith completely fluid and sophisticated even off the cuff
2235211 contributed to making him one of the most sought after and best known advocates of modern art
2235212 some people leave home and it doesnt stay with them but with kirk there was something in his sensibility that echoed his savannah heritage

2235469 there is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities
2235470 would probably be greater than any seen in the last 10 000 years but the actual annual to decadal changes would include considerable natural variability
2235471 does the warming of the earth have a direct effect on the strength of hurricanes
2235472 the strongest hurricanes in the present climate may be upstaged by even more intense hurricanes over the next century as the earths climate is warmed by increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere although we cannot say at present whether more or fewer hurricanes will occur in the future with global warming the hurricanes that do occur near the end of the 21st century are expected to be stronger and have significantly more intense rainfall than under present day climate conditions
2235473 reliable data since the 1940s indicate that the peak strength of the strongest hurricanes has not changed and the mean maximum intensity of all hurricanes has decreased
2235474 computer simulations suggest that in a warmer world most of the warming would occur in the polar regions atmospheric circulation which crucially affects storms is driven primarily by the temperature difference or gradient between the tropics and the poles
2235475 warmer polar regions would reduce this gradient and thus lessen the overall intensity or frequency or both of storms not just tropical storms but mid latitude winter storms as well such as blizzards and northeasters
2235476 again longer periods of history bear this out in the past warmer periods have seen a decline in the number and severity of storms this is well documented in scientific journals for data extending back centuries or even millennia if the surface temperature of the planet rises further in the future it is likely that these declines will continue
2235477 and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring mens hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken

2235510 aimee contemplates about a tree at the third location which she eventually gets kick ass photos of
2235511 a closer shot of the amazing stone uprisings at location 3
2235512 heres a couple of panoramic shots from locations 2 amp 3
2235513 this was a panoramic shot from location 4 at the south end of the valley 16 photos merged
2235514 upon leaving the valley aimee pulled the car over one last time to get this nice shot
2235515 aimee takes advantage of some dam nice light on the dam rocks
2235516 fighting off the acrophobia i leaned into a dam shot hehe
2235517 although this looks like a wet rocky trail its actually a 2 000ft vertical rock wall
2235518 oooooooohhhh shit thats cold but it feels so goooood lol
2235519 on the way back there were some really great photo ops
2235520 i think some ninja took this photo or somethin the shade helped but it was still very hot
2235521 getting low by the river to capture a nice comp
2235522 aimee gets her setting adjusted for a great sun flare
2235523 i was trying to get a nice comp of the drips
2235524 when we reached the lower emerald aimee noticed that i was following something around
2235525 heres the little crazy fella i was chasing it was a spazzed out little bird picking out tiny insects out of the water that flowed down the rock walls from up above it was not afraid of me at all in fact there were several moments when it came within a foot of my step lol
2235526 in the meantime aimee was pensive about her next shot
2235527 her next shot revealed a wet wall with calcium amp other mineral stains on it great texture
2235528 i wanted the water drops to streak but that required 1 10 of a second burst and i needed the
2235529 these holes in the wall caught my attention just off the trail
2235530 i asked aimee to pose for a photo not too bad as in the words of borat very nice
2235531 aimee gets in one last shot for this trail i really love this slip focus
2235532 on the way to the tunnel i spotted what looked like an old tunnel on the side of the cliff
2235533 there was a small line to wait in while the westbound traffic emerged from the tunnel
2235534 as soon as it was clear we were off into the tunnel which was not lit except for the holes on the side

2235540 i ask you and whoever is behind you to review the way you behave because the jihadi groups are acting very badly towards those who think differently from the way they do
2235541 i aks you to stop the armed operations in the arab countries to guarantee the security of muslims and to retract your threats toward the west to take away from them the terrorism card used by some western governments to hate islam and muslims

2235551 if that ever happens it is because i feel the majority of democrats have gone in a direction that i dont feel comfortable with
2235552 thats about all i will say on it today that would hurt
2235553 a lot of democrats are essentially pacifists and somewhat isolationists
2235554 that would be stunning to me and very hurtful and id be deeply affected by it lets put it that way

2235556 i have so many good friends in the senate john mccain is a very good friend
2235557 the thing i quote most from it is the power of demographics in europe particularly
2235558 but the other part is a kind of confirmation of what i know and what ive read elsewhere which is that islamist extremism has an ideology and its expansionist we americans will have ultimate responsibility for stopping this expansionism
2235559 why do i trust president bush in spite of the mistakes that were made consequential mistakes because having watched him having talked to him i believe that he understands the life and death struggle we are in with the most deadly and unconventional enemy islamic extremism
2235560 and he has shown himself notwithstanding all these mistakes willing to go forward with what he believes is right for the security of the country regardless of what it has done to his popularity

2235610 in virtually every behavior we look at genes have an influence one person will behave one way another person will behave another way
2235611 most youth or adults who commit a violent crime will not commit a second
2235612 the group we are concerned with are the recidivists those who have been arrested many times this is the group for whom there might be some biological contribution
2235613 do we tell the mothers of all 15 that their kids might be violent how are the mothers then going to react to their children if we do that
2235614 seeking the biological and genetic aspects of violence is dangerous to african american youth
2235615 when you consider the perception that black people have always been the violent people in this society it is a short step from this stereotype to using this kind of research for social control

2235619 the primary problems that afflict human beings are not due to their bodies or brains they are due to the environment
2235620 redefining social problems as public health problems is exactly what was done in nazi germany
2235621 we tend to say crime and poverty are not our fault and put the blame not on society but on genes

2235820 oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive
2235821 i think everything is going to be just fine now
2235822 there are really bad people in the world they have to be dealt with most times severely think of it as preventing any further horrors to be committed it must be done and if not you then someone else will have to do it you are doing your country a great justice think of it in that light it becomes understandable do you see that
2235823 someone threw a molotov cocktail into her mothers shop she sews for us americans i think we should fly her to japan

2235834 read history its gone on since man crawled out of a cave greed and stupidity
2235835 im here i just lack initiative and would like to meet you
2235836 in three words i can sum up everything ive learned about life it goes on
2235837 we are all travelers in the wilderness of this world and the best we can find in our travels is an honest friend
2235838 the truth that makes men free is for the most part the truth which men prefer not to hear

2235841 i am sitting down by lake rotorua and it is stunning the water is blue and clear there are clouds in the sky but the sun is shining on through a sea plane has just landed and its engine burbles away as it coasts into the dock with the water gently laps against the edge of the lake
2235842 had i not just been cr pped on by a seagull the scene would be perfect
2235843 charlie will you please answer charlie i know you can fucking hear me so answer right now charlie im your wife for gods sake talk to me
2235844 charlie these are our kids and they havent seen you all fucking day i need to go grocery shopping and i need you to be here right fucking now
2235845 it would not seem fair of me to wage a debate when your comments are invisible to others so ill only comment if your input does get released from moderation
2235846 the legislative equivalent of breaking and entering with an ominous free pass to the hijacking of constitutional values
2235847 the risk of investing the fbi with unchecked discretion to restrict such speech is that government agents based on their own self certification may limit speech that does not pose a significant threat to national security or other compelling government interest
2235848 but mr head since youre here and im here doesnt that make it our time
2235849 since im here and youre here doesnt that make it our ball
2235850 but what is the point of a freeze as opposed to a slow down or a speed up or cutting it in half or getting rid of it altogether
2235851 the ice age seems to have been favourable for us are you sure you want a new venue after 39 million years
2235852 you may see recent history as one holocaust after another
2235853 and to count terje among the pro kyoto mob shows an amazing lack of ability to read
2235854 if we want to be taken seriously as an intellegent party then we have nothing to gain by clinging to embarassing junk science when the agreed reality is enough to defend our policy there is no need to discredit ourselves like that
2235855 human civilisation is recent in the history of the earth and it has coincided with the time when our temperature has been fairly consistent terje pointed out this temperature has been good for us you said it was one holocaust after another you were wrong in fact human history with this relatively consistent temperature has been the story of progress
2235856 the ice age seems to have been favourable for us are you sure you want a new venue after 39 million years
2235857 you may see recent history as one holocaust after another
2235858 human civilisation is recent in the history of the earth and it has coincided with the time when our temperature has been fairly consistent terje pointed out this temperature has been good for us you said it was one holocaust after another you were wrong in fact human history with this relatively consistent temperature has been the story of progress
2235859 nobody has evidence for catastrophic warming having already happened there is a possibility that it may happen in the future and that makes up part of the debate i dont doubt the possibility of warming that creates a negative but i dont think it justifies any government action if you pretend the debate is about proof of catastrophic warming then you are intentionally making yourself irrelevant
2235860 but i dont agree that most climate scientists are junk scientists
2235861 you state that because there is no evidence for catastrophic warning that therefore coal fired power is good that is a non sequitor there is no logical connection there
2235862 graeme on this comments thread you admitted that humans are contributing to increased global temperatures
2235863 the point terje was making quite clearly was that our civilisation has done well in this temperature range
2235864 graeme i dont mind you saying i fucked up but you have to go on and show where
2235865 two times one is two two times two is four two times three is many two times four is many two times five is many
2235866 alright kids i think weve earnt ourselves the rest of the day off
2235867 there is no warming problem there is no evidence for catastrophic warming therefore coal fired power is good
2235868 you state that because there is no evidence for catastrophic warning that therefore coal fired power is good that is a non sequitor there is no logical connection there
2235869 get it right humphreys morphing and condensing my comments to call it a non sequitor is so fucking lame sort your act out
2235870 you may see recent history as one holocaust after another i disagree i see it as a story of progress
2235871 graeme on this comments thread you admitted that humans are contributing to increased global temperatures but you claim that this is a good thing because we have been in an ice age for 39 million years and in a severe phase for the last 3
2235872 the ice age seems to have been favourable for us are you sure you want a new venue after 39 million years
2235873 you may see recent history as one holocaust after another i disagree i see it as a story of progress
2235874 there is no warming problem there is no evidence for catastrophic warming therefore coal fired power is good if it warms the atmosphere up more then sic it otherwise would be thats sic a good thing
2235875 you state that because there is no evidence for catastrophic warning that therefore coal fired power is good that is a non sequitor there is no logical connection there
2235876 graeme on this comments thread you admitted that humans are contributing to increased global temperatures but you claim that this is a good thing because we have been in an ice age for 39 million years and in a severe phase for the last 3
2235877 the ice age seems to have been favourable for us are you sure you want a new venue after 39 million years
2235878 you may see recent history as one holocaust after another i disagree i see it as a story of progress
2235879 that basic disagreement is that you deny the possibility that warming could be harmful to the world
2235880 the ice age seems to have been favourable for us
2235881 the point terje was making is that human civilisation has done well in our current temperature range
2235882 warming will be good for the world if it happens
2235883 but it warming could be bad for the world as a sort of hypothetical
2235884 and you might think that jihadism will go a way if you just treat it like a natural disaster an act of god
2235885 the fact is the science goes against the alarmists and we should say this
2235886 were all going to die be scared of the greenhouse gas under your bed
2235887 i ignore the elephant in the room because it is prancing around drunk in a tutu sqwarking incoherent babble
2235888 represents our rain forest and local cultures for instance the 47 arches look like tree branches which supports a soaring roof that reaches 114 meters
2235889 symbolises the people and the democratic system that it upholds
2235890 indeed perhaps you should check which is a greater threat to your life terrorists or lightning or pesticide poisoning or falling down stairs or smoking or sex
2235891 fearmongering is the number one tool of the government lover
2235892 stop trusting your beloved government and learn to love freedom
2235893 stop stealing my tax money for your foreign adventures and stop taking away my right to privacy and liberty for the sake of your delicate and irrational peace of mind
2235894 so what are the costs of terrorism what are the costs of our anti terror activities good questions eh i already know the answers but i look forward to you discovering them
2235895 the good city is not guided in its relations to other cities greek or barbarian by considerations of justice the size of the territory of the good city is determined by that citys own moderate needs and by nothing else the relation of the city to the other cities belongs to the province of wisdom rather than of justice the good city is not a part of a community of cities or is not dedicated to the common good of that community or does not serve other cities
2235896 for the classics wrote strauss foreign policy is primarily concerned with
2235897 the ultimate aim of foreign policy is not essentially controversial hence classical political philosophy is not guided by questions concerning the external relations of the political community it is concerned primarily with the inner structure of the political community
2235898 thus according to strauss the purpose of foreign policy is or ought to be survival and independence or self preservation and nothing else
2235899 obviously it is in americas interest that foreign governments stop sponsoring and aiding murderous acts against america and its allies especially against israel its most reliable ally in the middle east
2235900 in life as in math we judge the importance of any part of any problem or structure by factoring it out does the equation still work does the building or the argument still stand imagine if a magic wand were to eliminate from the earth al qaeda osama bin laden and afghanistans taliban regime with them gone would americans be safe from arab terrorists no way then what good does it do for the u s government to make war on them and no one else why not make war on those whose elimination would eliminate terrorism
2235901 clearly it is impossible to kill any regime by killing its people indiscriminately
2235902 it is important that u s forces invade iraq with the stated objective of hanging saddam and whoever we judge to have been too close to him once those close to him realize that this is going to happen and cannot be stopped they will kill one another each trying to demonstrate that he was farther from the tyrant than anyone else but americas reputation for bluff and for half measures is so entrenched that the invasion will have to make progress greater than in the gulf war in order for this to happen at this point whether or not saddam himself falls into u s hands alive along with his subordinates it is essential that all be denounced tried and hanged on one charge only having made war on america on their own people and on their neighbors
2235903 if i dont believe in rational analysis of consequences what do i believe just blind faith in government
2235904 graeme my view of war is that it is a government activity that can only be justified if it makes us better off like all govt activity i believe that the only way to work out if a war is good is by rationally assessing the likely benefits and costs of the war
2235905 i state the fact remember those that there is a low risk from terrorism
2235906 no finnish government has dared to act against some of its own citizens who obviously look after soviet interests in the country
2235907 you have decided to treat it as a natural phenomenon
2235908 and you want to put your head in the sand
2235909 give me big government more tax more tax help me dear government the government will save us
2235910 now stop being a fucking gutless ostrich an idiot and a stupid fucking fool and outline your defense policy
2235911 under your policy we would be a porn of any regime who decided to murder australians to promote their agenda
2235912 no i havent i treat it as an act of violence generally against civilians committed by a non government organisation for a political purpose
2235913 ho ho its a non government organisation nothing to do with warfare
2235914 my primary defence concern is to defend the air sea gap against any non super power level invasion
2235915 from you comments it is fairly clear you have never worked in or near this industry
2235916 does that mean he is wrong or that you dont have something more meaningful to add
2235917 we feel this is a way to leverage cares money to facilitate large scale improvements
2235918 this is essentially a blank investment in the rec center
2235919 its a leap of faith the city is coming to meet us halfway theres buy in on both sides
2235920 it will either be allowed to slowly become obsolete or it can be kept as a viable and important recreation resource for the entire community
2235921 the cares money will offset any tax increases over the next six years that would be necessary to pay off the bonds
2235922 when we are putting so much of our money into recreation it worries me that were taking money away from things we need to do
2235923 goes against a lot of the guidelines the advisory board has established they have turned down proposals that are continuations of already functioning programs because they were not new and innovative the money to the rec center is primarily for renovation now new or expanded programs
2235924 people in town have resented for a long long time that they are supporting the rec complex and so many other people are using it
2235925 there is a feeling among people that the city has taken on the full load of the rec center
2235926 this is a way to help offset the imbalance that city residents have been paying
2235927 the city provides recreational services for the entire school district and has for years
2235928 historically recreation has been a very important part of our community
2235929 the majority of our community values recreation and healthy family activity
2235930 the types of thing weve tried to do with the teen center money have had only moderate success
2235931 we havent done with that money what we thought we could do with it and the intent to have good swimming activities for the community will be well served
2235932 the rec complex is the major recreational facility in saline if cares is about supporting recreation then why wouldnt it support a recreational facility

2235961 i mods tning til p stande om at internettet enten er kilde til fornyet f llesskab eller rsag til fremmedg relse fra den virkelige verden s synes den sociale interaktion p internettet ikke at have en direkte indflydelse p den m de hverdagslivet former sig p generelt set ud over at det f jer en on line interaktion til allerede eksisterende sociale relationer

2235964 det er derfor ikke internettet der skaber et m nster af netv rksbaseret individualisme det er udviklingen af internettet der stiller et velegnet materielt hj lpemiddel til r dighed til udbredelsen af netv rksbaseret individualisme som den fremherskende form for socialisering
2235965 disse tendenser er ensbetydende med individets triumf om end omkostningerne for samfundet stadig er uklare medmindre vi er af den opfattelse at individet rent faktisk er ved at omstrukturere m nstret for social interaktion med hj lp fra nye teknologiske redskaber for at skabe en ny samfundsform netv rkssamfundet

2235969 i thought that if i set up a web site for people who love toy trains i might sell five a month so i bought 5000 worth of stock and thought that if it didnt sell wed put the trains on ebay i hadnt factored in the cost of building the web site product insurance company set up prepaid couriers and so on which added up to around 10 000 thankfully we had sales of 20 000 in 12 weeks

2236006 theres nothing suspicious about the death it was in his flat on bodmin road
2236007 the place is all due to be redeveloped he was the last resident left there he lived there alone
2236008 what makes or breaks this group is not only our study of the word but whether or not the girls in my case felt comfortable to open up about who they are and their lives the first time i led the group i was pretty nervous while i was preparing the bible study i felt god asking me to do something that i was trying to avoid i have always felt the need to meet high expectations so naturally i wouldnt want to tell others of sins i have struggled with however god has really been working on my heart to admit to myself and to others how much we need christ in light of all of our sins so i made the decision to share these struggles with my group even though i wasnt sure how they would receive this information i have to say this was one of the biggest blessings god has given me because this group of girls was so supportive and understanding as a result all 3 of the other girls opened up about their struggles and our bond of sisters in christ was definitely strengthened i looked forward to our life group time every week because i knew god would speak to us through the scriptures and the other girls in my group would continue to share their hearts with everyone these were definitely some of the great moments of mine on the summer project but the lord really helped me grow throughout the entire experience
2236009 youve probably heard all your life that god wont put any burden on you greater than you can bear dont mark me off as a heretic just yet but i dont believe it i believe god will put heavier burdens on you than you can bear especially when he is trying to bring you to the place of brokenness god will allow the burden to be greater than you can bear so that you will finally allow him to bear it for you gods purpose in the breaking process is to bring you to the end of your own resources so that you will be ready to understand that he is the only resource you need in life as long as your own abilities are sufficient to rise to the challenge you will never understand that he doesnt just give strength he is your strength in the breaking process god has no intention of helping you get stronger he wants you to become so week that he can express himself as the strength you need in every situation
2236010 cast your burden on the lord and he will sustain you

2236134 so you sprint from fire to fire praying you havent forgotten anything sapped of anything like creativity or even the basic human flexibility to adapt your own schedule to the needs of your friends your family or yourself your stuff has taken over your brain like a virus now dragging down every process it touches and rendering you spent and virtually useless sound familiar
2236135 so i wanted to start a conversation about how geeks handle their lists their projects and their agendas not so much in terms of the tool they use to store the information although thats fair game as with how they segment the information and decide when to break it into pieces
2236136 but for me turning anxieties into projects and projects into discrete physical behaviors has a lot of appeal it takes all the pressure off your brain and puts it back where it belongs on your eyes on your hands and on that fat ass you need to get into gear
2236137 ive noticed that there are often items on my next actions list that hang around a lot longer than they should i scan and rescan and sort and add and delete but theres always a few stragglers who hang out there for a week or more eventually this starts to vex me and i try to debug why things arent getting done
2236138 my mini review falls somewhere between the glances i give my lists throughout the day and the comprehensive weekly review i do each weekend its basically a 10 minute metamoment where i stop working and just try to re focus on my goals and the tactical adjustments needed to get them moved forward today
2236139 the thread that runs through all of these is that the onus is on me to a make sure these items represent part of a commitment ive made and b make sure they actually get done even if its not my direct responsibility otherwise they should get moved onto my maybe later list right
2236140 i recently realized that this month marks one year since i started using getting things done in earnest with the calendar year closing it seems like an apt time to look back at whats worked what hasnt and where id like to see gtd heading in the future
2236141 i employ an informal getting things done action strategy thats similar to the one chris lays out in his post
2236142 this is my stake in the ground about gtd if you can stay focused on drawing from its best practices to get more of the important things in your life accomplished then youll be a happy kid for real but if like a seeming majority of people i encounter these days you allow yourself to obsess endlessly over the minutest details of implementation and maintenance well youre screwed youre wasting your time
2236143 by and large youll discover your head is flooded with this stuff that you arent or havent been doing anything about not coincidentally this is almost always stuff that represents some kind of incompletion functional fuzziness or procrastination on your part
2236144 if you feel a gnaw about the loss of your old contexts try to shunt some of the mental load into sub projects and better verb choices in your tasks
2236145 but as ever if youre fussing and thinking and fiddling and wondering about this stuff you arent doing it and dammit thats what this is all about
2236146 unless you can always satisfy the big red letter commitments youve created for yourself as well as the ones that are constantly being generated for you by others an obsession with priority alone is pointlessly stress inducing unhealthy and unrealistic
2236147 hope you all enjoy hearing the whole series in order all in one place theres some nuggets of gtd gold in there if i do say so myself

2236710 today a kid is as likely to come home alone because his parents are off shuttling siblings to football and dance practice as he is because one or both parents are still at work
2236711 in the early days of home security the systems basically were designed to just keep the bad guys out
2236712 now many parents are also using them to ensure their children safely enter and stay in the house
2236713 many parents realize that home security systems can not only keep the bad guys out but help keep their children safely inside the home when parents cant be there with them
2236714 graham promoted the creation of a computerized program called building optimization program bop
2236715 many people began to realize that computer software would have produced a lot of money and they threw themselves into this market investing in research with a force that for us became impossible to compete with them
2236716 this sale still remains something difficult to stand we were used to create our own software customized for what we wanted to do and now we are dependent of others who do things for us and that of course are not in the way in which we want them we are always having to evaluate different software to find the one that better fits to our needs
2236717 graham fu promotore della creazione di un programma computerizzato denominato building optimization program bop
2236718 molta gente cominciava a rendersi conto che i software per computer avrebbero fatto moltissimi soldi e ci si buttarono investendo denaro e ricerca con una forza tale che per noi divent impossibile competere
2236719 ancora oggi la vendita rimane una cosa difficile da digerire eravamo abituati a crearci da soli il software su misura per quello che volevamo fare e adesso ci troviamo a dipendere da altri che fanno le cose per noi e che naturalmente non le fanno nel modo in cui noi vogliamo farle ci troviamo sempre a dover valutare i diversi software per trovare quello che si avvicina di pi alle nostre esigenze

2236738 type of innuendo that has passed for news over the last few days or is it weeks months as my eyes begin to close i think i see one of the guests juggling bruised apples and rotten oranges into the air
2236739 can you give me one good reason not to quit
2236740 when i planted the fern and the bamboo seeds i took very good care of them i gave them light i gave them water the fern quickly grew from the earth its brilliant green covered the floor yet nothing came from the bamboo seed but i did not quit on the bamboo in the second year the fern grew more vibrant and plentiful and again nothing came from the bamboo seed but i did not quit on the bamboo
2236741 in year three there was still nothing from the bamboo seed but i would not quit in year four again there was nothing from the bamboo seed i would not quit
2236742 then in the fifth year a tiny sprout emerged from the earth compared to the fern it was seemingly small and insignificant but just 6 months later the bamboo rose to over 100 feet tall it had spent the five years growing roots those roots made it strong and gave it what it needed to survive i would not give any of my creations a challenge it could not handle
2236743 did you know my child that all this time you have been struggling you have actually been growing roots
2236744 i would not quit on the bamboo i will never quit on you
2236745 the bamboo had a different purpose from the fern yet they both make the forest beautiful

2236749 the figures show that killing a journalist is virtually risk free
2236750 ongoing impunity for the killers of journalists who put themselves in harms way to keep world society informed shames not only the governments who are responsible for their own lack of action but also the democracies that stand aside in silence
2236751 the first shocking thing about this report is to learn just how many are dying
2236752 the second shocking thing is to learn how many were murdered most of them local beat reporters whose names do not resonate in the media the majority of journalists deaths are not bad luck
2236753 the dead journalists in these countries have typically been working on stories about corruption drug trafficking and other criminal affairs
2236754 the indian media is dynamic and protective of its freedoms and plays a crucial role in the countrys democratic system however in states shaken by separatist or maoist rebellions journalists are caught in the crossfire
2236755 the media only reflects public anger these operations show political corruption and rackets that are too common in our society
2236756 with more than 60 million subscribers cable news channels have taken over as the countrys leading media
2236757 the intrepidness of indian journalists often leads to reprisals at least 65 were assaulted or received death threats from police officers criminals company heads or political militants during the year
2236758 did not really benefit from the indian pakistani rapprochement in kashmir

2236775 i found out november 28 that they were going to renew it how could i have held a deadline and gotten the money out by march 31 2007 it would have been virtually impossible
2236776 i went to a consultation that the canadian television fund had and they said yes they were interested in multiplatform
2236777 then when the question came up about interactive they said no so there seems to be a line drawn between yes well repurpose it for cell phones and ipods but were not necessarily going to go into interactive

2236783 because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice

2236829 well surely they know to start at the top and work their way down the list
2236830 we have nothing to do with the outcast and the unfit let them die in their misery
2236831 he had caught a glimpse of the devil aiwass was the messenger of hoor paar kraat that is to say set the destroyer god the brother and murderer of osiris set was also called sheraton and sheraton is the prototype of the christian satan
2236832 it was damn hard to think of the rottenest kind of creature as a word
2236833 we observed a brownish yellow light about seven feet high i brandished a magical sword and it disappeared hubbards right arm was paralyzed for the rest of the night
2236834 babylon the great the mother of harlot and abominations of the earth drunken with the blood of saints and with the blood of the martyrs of jesus
2236835 my mind was being ripped away from me by force
2236836 you are sexually wonderful your sexual prowess has never before been equaled on the face of the earth
2236837 there were lots of mistresses when i was younger i participated in private orgies with him and three or four other women his theory was that one has to open or crack a womans soul in order for the satanic power to pour through it and into him it got kind of far out culminating in a variety of sex acts dad also had an incredibly violent temper he was into s amp m and would beat his mistresses and shoot them full of drugs
2236838 the explanation is sort of long and complicated the basic rationale is that there are some powers in this universe that are pretty strong
2236839 as an example hitler was involved in the same black magic and the same occult practices that my father was the identical ones which as i have said stem clear back to before egyptian times its a very secret thing very powerful and very workable and very dangerous
2236840 its like cracking open the soul which then opens various doors to the power that exists the satanic and demonic powers simply put its like a tunnel or an avenue or a doorway pulling that power into yourself through another person and using women especially is incredibly insidious
2236841 it makes dr fu manchu look like a kindergarten student it is the ultimate vampirism the ultimate mind fuck instead of going for blood youre going for their soul and you take drugs in order to reach that state where you can quite literally like a psychic hammer break their soul and pull the power through
2236842 he designed his scientology operating thetan techniques scientologys secret initiations to do the same thing but of course it takes a couple of hundred hours of auditing and mega thousands of dollars for the privilege of having your head turned into a glass humpty dumpty shattered into a million pieces it may sound like incredible gibberish but it made my father a fortune
2236843 also ive got to complete this by saying that he thought of himself as the beast 666 incarnate
2236844 yes aleister crowley thought of himself as such and when crowley died in 1947 my father then decided that he should wear the cloak of the beast and become the most powerful being in the universe
2236845 scientology is black magic that is spread out over a long time period
2236846 also youve got to realize that my father did not worship satan
2236847 the one super secret sentence that scientology is built on is do as thou wilt that is the whole of the law it also comes from the black magic from aleister crowley it means that you are a law unto yourself that you are above the law that you create your own law you are above any other human considerations
2236848 to stroke and taste the environs of the great beast to fondle crowleys books papers and memorabilia had filled him with pure ecstasy in london he had acquired at last the final keys enabling him to take his place upon the throne of the beast to which he firmly believed himself to be the rightful heir the tech gushed forth and resulted in the philadelphia doctorate course lectures
2236849 having allowed the mind to return for some hundred times to the hour of birth it should be encouraged to endeavor to penetrate beyond that period
2236850 after twenty runs through birth the patient experienced a recession of all somatics and unconsciousness and aberrative content
2236851 thus there was no inhibition about looking earlier than birth for what dianetics had begun to call basic basic
2236852 having allowed the mind to return for some hundred times to the hour of birth it should be encouraged to endeavor to penetrate beyond that period if it be properly trained to run backwards there will be little difficulty in doing this
2236853 official psychoanalysis is therefore committed to upholding a fraud psychoanalysts have misinterpreted life and announced the absurdity that every human being is essentially an antisocial criminal and insane animal
2236854 the original definition of scientology 8 8008 was the attainment of infinity by the reduction of the apparent infinity and power of the mest matter energy space time universe to a zero for himself and the increase of the apparent zero of ones own universe to an infinity for oneself it can be seen that the infinity symbol stood upright makes the number eight
2236855 the great work is the raising of the whole man in perfect balance to the power of infinity
2236856 our whole activity tends to make an individual completely independent of any limitation
2236857 the adept must prepare and publish a thesis setting forth his knowledge of the universe and his proposals for its welfare and progress he will thus be known as the leader of a school of thought
2236858 you can be merciless whenever your will is crossed and you have every right to be merciless
2236859 all women shall succumb to my charms all mankind shall grovel at my feet and not know why
2236860 i have high hopes of smashing my name into history so violently that it will take legendary form
2236861 the only way you can control people is to lie to them you can write that down in your book in great big letters the only way you can control anybody is to lie to them
2236862 if you really want to enslave people tell them that you are going to give them total freedom
2236863 an enemy may be deprived of property or injured by any means by any scientologist without any discipline of the scientologist may be tricked sued lied to or destroyed
2236864 a suppressive person becomes fair game by fair game is meant may not be further protected by the codes and disciplines of scientology they cannot be granted the rights and beingness ordinarily accorded rational beings and so place themselves beyond any consideration for their feelings or well being the homes property places abodes of persons who have been active in attempting to suppress scientology are all beyond the protection of scientology ethics
2236865 when you move off a point of power pay all your obligations on the nail empower your friends completely and move off with your pockets full of artillery potential blackmail on every erstwhile rival unlimited funds in your private account and the addresses of experienced assassins and go live in bulgaria and bribe the police
2236866 so to live at all in the shadow or employ of a power you must yourself gather and use enough power to hold your own without just nattering to the power to kill pete in straightforward or more suppressive veiled ways to him as these wreck the power that supports yours
2236867 well hell say if he really is a poor why are you bothering me with it if its done and you did it
2236868 good when theyve done it take dober down to the dispensary for any treatment he needs oh yes raise his pay
2236869 we all arent on the stage with our names in lights always push power in the direction of anyone on whose power you depend it may be more money for the power or more ease or a snarling defense of the power to a critic or even the dull thud of one of his enemies in the dark or the glorious blaze of the whole enemy camp as a birthday surprise real powers are developed by tight conspiracies of this kind pushing someone up in whose leadership they have faith
2236870 this universe is a rough universe its a deadly serious universe only the strong survive only the ruthless can own it
2236871 the purpose of ethics is to remove counter intentions from the environment
2236872 a very effective thought control technique could be worked out from scientology which could be used to make individuals into willing slaves
2236873 moon child he predicted one of his members would form a new world religion is that world religion scientology
2236874 the magical cults of the 8th 9th 10th 11th and 12th centuries in the middle east were fascinating the only modern work that has anything to do with them is a trifle wild in spots but is a fascinating work in itself and thats the work of aleister crowley the late aleister crowley my very good friend
2236875 scientologists hold the bible as a holy work and have no argument with the christian belief that jesus christ was the savior of mankind and the son of god
2236876 we share christs goals for mans achievements of wisdom good health and immortality
2236877 while on the confidential class 8 course in scotland listening to hubbards twenty lectures taped just weeks previously on the apollo in corfu greece i was exposed to among other things hubbards opinion of christianity
2236878 whats wrong with this universe a working package for the auditor
2236879 youll find out thousands of years before the year one a d earth you will have facsimiles and dolls made up like christ fac one a million years ago is occasionally rigged with christ and the devil and an angel its a fascinating thing its an old game
2236880 religion does much to keep the assumption in restimulation being basically a control mechanism used by those who have sent the preclear into a body you will find the cross as a symbol all over the universe and the christ legend as implant in preclears a million years ago
2236881 a few operating thetans scarcely could lead to trouble witness the chaos resulting from the activities and other determinism technology of one operating thetan 2 000 years ago it is despicable and utterly beneath contempt to tell a man he must repent that he is evil those who talk most about peace on earth and good will among men themselves carry forward the seas of unrest war and chaos
2236882 the whole christian movement is based on the victim compulsion of the overt motivator sequence they won by appealing to victims we can win by converting victims christianity succeeded by making people into victims we can succeed by making victims into people
2236883 some churches used a mechanism of confession this was a limited effort to relieve a person of the pressure of his overt acts later the mechanism of confession was employed as a kind of blackmail by which increased contribution could be obtained from the person confessing
2236884 based on over a thousand hours of research auditing analyzing the facsimiles of the reactive mind and with the help of a mark v electrometer it is scientific research and is not in any way based upon the mere opinion of the researcher the contents of this hco bulletin discover the apparent underlying impulses of religious zealots and the source of the religious mania which terrorized earth over the ages and has given religion the appearance of insanity
2236885 the goals problems mass gpm implants which are the apparent basic source of aberration and human travail which began with the goal to forget were cynically done in heaven
2236886 for a long while some people have been cross with me for my lack of cooperation in believing in a christian heaven god and christ i have never said i didnt disbelieve in a big thetan but there was certainly something very corny about heaven et al
2236887 now i have to apologize there was a heaven not too unlike in cruel betrayal the heaven of the assassins in the 12th century who like everyone else dramatized the whole track implants if a bit more so the symbol of the crucified christ is very apt indeed its the symbol of a thetan betrayed
2236888 the gates of the first series are well done well built
2236889 the second series probably in the same place shows what a trillion years of overt acts does or is an additional trick to collapse ones time the place is shabby the vegetation is gone the pillars are scruffy the saints have vanished so have the angels
2236890 a sign on one the left as you enter says this is heaven
2236891 the roadway leading up to the gates is deeply eroded an effigy of joseph complete with desert clothing is seen approaching the gates but not moving leading a donkey which carries the original madonna and child from bethlehem the implanting boxes lie on either side of this entering path at path level
2236892 further we have our hands on an appalling bit of technology where the world is concerned with rapidity and a meter it can be shown that heaven is a false dream and that the old religion was based on very painful lie a cynical betrayal
2236893 the man on the cross there was no christ the roman catholic church through watching the dramatizations of people picked up some little fragments of r6
2236894 also the christian church used and uses implanting they took over the nicene creed just before the year zero invented christ who comes from the crucifixion in r6 75 million years ago and implanted their way to power
2236895 except for the purpose of deceit scientology has not been practiced in victoria on the basis that it even remotely resembles a religion
2236896 more modern man has fallen into the error of making god into the body of a homo sapiens and posting him somewhere on high with a craving for vengeance and a pettiness in punishment matched only by the degradation of homo sapiens himself
2236897 there are gods above all other gods and gods beyond the gods of universes but it were better far better to be a raving madman in his cell than to be a thing with the ego cruelty and jealous lust that base religions have set up to make men grovel down
2236898 if there ever was a manifestation of the satanic dark side of spirituality or of the beast or anything that could really harm the world it is scientology the difference you need to realize between this satanic group and every other satanic group is that scientology is vastly larger it doesnt identify itself as a satanic organization and a satanic church it is incredibly well organized as far as its staff and its paramilitary training the other satanic groups are much much smaller fragmented random and arent really very well organized or well planned scientology runs with the efficiency of a japanese corporation in scientology we are talking about teamwork organization absolute policy fanaticism ruthlessness all combined into a well financed mega organization
2236899 they had devised the uniform themselves with the commodores approval and it gave them maximum opportunity to flaunt their pubescent assets to advantage while male members of the crew competed avidly to deflower the messengers hubbard himself never once exhibited any sexual interest in them
2236900 and as far as i know he never did with any of the other girls he didnt sleep with mary sue we thought perhaps he was impotent i think he got his thrills by just having us around i once asked him why he chose young girls as messengers
2236901 he said it was an idea he had picked up from nazi germany he said hitler was a madman but nevertheless a genius in his own right and the nazi youth was one of the smartest ideas he ever had with young people you had a blank slate and you could write anything you wanted on it and it would be your writing that was his idea to take young people and mold them into little hubbards
2236902 when someone enrolls consider he or she has joined up for the duration of the universe
2236903 remember this is our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of the past dont muff it now because it seems unpleasant or unsocial to do seven eight nine and ten
2236904 the purpose of a lawsuit is to harass and discourage rather than to win dont ever defend always attack find or manufacture enough threat against them to cause them to sue for peace originate a black pr campaign to destroy the persons repute and to discredit them so thoroughly they will be ostracized be alert to sue for slander at the slightest chance so as to discourage the public presses from mentioning scientology
2236905 the law can be used very easily to harass and enough harassment on somebody who is simply on the thin edge anyway will knowing that he is not authorized will generally be sufficient to cause his professional decease if possible of course ruin him utterly
2236906 the defense of anything is untenable the only way to defend anything is to attack and if you ever forget that you will lose every battle you are engaged in whether it is in terms of personal conversation public debate or a court of law never be interested in charges do yourself much more charging and you will win
2236907 entirely by bringing about public conviction that the sanity of a person is in question it is possible to discount and eradicate all the goals and activities of that person
2236908 now if we were to sit down and try to monopolize every piece of information which we ever collected and we were to take this information and carefully say now look this piece of information is absolutely sacred and its not to be distributed to anybody and its not to be given to anybody and only those people who have a pink cross on the right shoulder will be able to read this information we would go into a mysterious sort of cult
2236909 in addition to violating and abusing its own members civil rights the scientology organization over the years with its
2236910 the evidence portrays a man who has been virtually a pathological liar when it comes to his history background and achievements the writings and documents in evidence additionally reflect his egoism greed avarice lust for power and vindictiveness and aggressiveness against persons perceived by him to be disloyal or hostile
2236911 she got what she deserved we dont feel sorry for her
2236912 get back to work its just another body what are you showing all this concern for
2236913 i believe the scientologists to be psychological hostages and under the influence of hypnosis although they themselves do not perceive this to be so any more than i did while i was in scientology i became aware of the fact only after i snapped out of the hypnosis a year and a half after i left scientology and realized what had happened to me
2236914 scientologists are so thoroughly indoctrinated that they are incapable of rational evaluation of their own welfare or situations those who want to leave are often unable to do so with no money frightened and intimidated and knowing that others have committed suicide have died in accidents or perhaps been murdered they cannot leave without contact with the outside world they have no one to turn to for help or protection
2236915 i have witnessed many human rights violations including the imprisonment of persons who had become psychotic on the secret upper level initiations of scientology i was myself imprisoned twice in the dreaded r p f rehabilitation project force of scientology i was slave labor to the organization working 80 100 hours a week my largest weekly pay was 11 i participated in satanic practices which nearly destroyed my mental health i am willing to testify under oath as to these facts
2236916 the vital targets on which we must invest most of our time are t1 depopularizing the enemy to the point of obliteration
2236917 intelligence is not concentrating on what they should be the wfmh world federation of mental health the namh national association of mental health these are the groups i want destroyed
2236918 thus in the case of scientology orgs organizations one should attack with the end view of taking over the whole field of mental health
2236919 our war has been forced to become to take over absolutely the field of mental healing on the planet in all forms
2236920 our only justification in doing these things is that scientology is the only game where everybody wins
2236921 the names and connections of the bitterly opposing enemy are 1 psychiatry and psychology not medicine 2 the heads of news media who are the directors of psychiatric fronts 3 a few key political figures in the fields of mental health and education
2236922 we went through three of these documents presented to him in their entirety
2236923 they designated that and impounded it your honor they seized it from mr lerma and they impounded it the same document this they lambaste the washington post for printing excerpts of
2236924 i believe that scientology is an evil organization involving among other things satanism brainwashing slave labor and physical and emotional abuse i believe that the only moral thing for me to do is to try to expose this situation to the public
2236925 as a recovering scientologist i must raise an ethical objection to the desire to control the minds of others without their consent
2236926 we can brainwash faster than the russians 20 seconds to total amnesia
2236927 i did most of his advanced occult initiations and i was a member for 25 years we are presently building a worldwide network to make known the actual intentions of hubbards organization as they relate to their views on other religions scientology is extremely antipathetic to all the major world religions and in many countries they are actively infiltrating unstable governments and seeking to establish scientology as a new state religion we invite clergymen and lay people of all faiths to join us in this project we recognize scientologys right to practice its religion but we feel we have a moral and ethical duty to inform world citizens of its hidden agenda and its extreme antipathy toward religions especially christianity
2236928 the government is satisfied that scientology is socially harmful it alienates members of families from each other and attributes squalid and disgraceful motives to all who oppose it its authoritarian principles and practice are a potential menace to the personality and well being of those so deluded as to become followers above all its methods can be a serious danger to the health of those who submit to them there is no power under existing law to prohibit the practice of scientology but the government has concluded that it is so objectionable that it would be right to take all steps within its power to curb its growth
2236929 the court record is replete with evidence that scientology is nothing in reality but a vast enterprise to extract the maximum amount of money from its adepts by pseudo scientific theories and to exercise a kind of blackmail against persons who do not wish to continue with their sect the organization clearly is schizophrenic and paranoid and this bizarre combination seems to be a reflection of its founder l ron hubbard
2236930 scientology is evil its techniques are evil its practice is a serious threat to the community medically morally and socially and its adherents are sadly deluded and often mentally ill scientology is the worlds largest organization of unqualified persons engaged in the practice of dangerous techniques which masquerade as mental therapy
2236931 in addition to violating and abusing its own members civil rights the organization over the years with its
2236932 scientology is both immoral and socially obnoxious it is corrupt sinister and dangerous it is corrupt because it is based on lies and deceit and has its real objective money and power for mr hubbard it is sinister because it indulges in infamous practices both to its adherents who do not toe the line unquestioningly and to those who criticize it or oppose it it is dangerous because it is out to capture people and to indoctrinate and brainwash them so they become the unquestioning captives and tools of the cult withdrawn from ordinary thought living and relationships with others
2236933 the crime committed by these defendants is of a breath and scope previously unheard of no building office desk or file was safe from their snooping and prying no individual or organization was free from their despicable conspiratorial minds the tools of their trade were miniature transmitters lock picks secret codes forged credentials and any other device they found necessary to carry out their conspiratorial schemes
2236934 in my opinion the church has one of the most effective intelligence operations in the u s rivaling even that of the fbi
2236935 substantial evidence supports the conclusion scientology leaders made the deliberate decision to ruin wollersheim economically and possible psychologically
2236936 a religious practice which takes place in the context of this level of coercion2 has less religious value than one the recipient engages in voluntarily even more significantly it poses a greater threat to society to have coerced religious practices inflicted on its citizens
2236937 church practices conducted in a coercive environment are not qualified to be voluntary religious practices entitled to first amendment religious freedom guarantees
2236938 such conduct is too outrageous to be protected under the constitution and too unworthy to be privileged under the law of torts
2236939 evidentiary fact the church of scientology is currently engaged in a nationwide conspiracy to impede and obstruct municipal state and federal taxing authorities by adopting a religious and charitable guise to avoid payment of taxes
2236940 churches are looked upon as reform groups therefore we must act like a reform group
2236941 scientology has nothing to do with religion the church did not adopt the religious guise until it was necessary to seek first amendment protection vol 4 p 405
2236942 scientology uses a religious image checklist designed to falsely portray a religious image to mislead officials vol 2 p 238 239
2236943 church policy instructs members to lie to inquiring officials vol 1 p 226 227
2236944 the teaching of scientology and the practice of scientology will result in the commission of many offenses and may well result in the commission of many others
2236945 you can be merciless whenever your will is crossed and you have the right to be merciless
2236946 its that the only way someone can leave you is if you let them and im not doing that it may look like that today or tomorrow or even a month from now but one day youre going to wake up and see that this whole time youve been gone youve only been headed back to where you started
2236947 greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends
2236948 never ask the wounded person how he feels instead become that wounded person yourself
2236949 no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby
2236950 i couldnt sleep last night thinking about what you are going through
2236951 a friend is one who knows you as you are understands where youve been accepts who youve become and still invites you to grow
2236952 so encourage each other and build each other up just as you are already doing
2236953 be humble and gentle be patient with each other making allowance for each others faults because of your love always keep yourselves united in the holy spirit and bind yourselves together with peace

2236960 i might hook up tonight so i should shave but im not going to do a great job because either he or i will be too drunk to pay that much attention to detail

2236962 you are so getting in the way of my happiness
2236963 if i stay over his house i need to remember to bring extra tampons with me
2236964 at least i can blame it on pms instead of apologizing
2236965 i realized unless something changes soon my major relationship would be with a bottle of wine
2236966 i have this theory they ask my advice just to do the exact opposite
2236967 wow my relationship might be a little weird but boy i pity the fool who tries to get in that head
2236968 eu and uk rhetoric is relatively strong but the policy is completely inadequate and theyre the best there is
2236969 the explanation of this temporal change in the radiative imbalance of the earth s climate system is a challenge to the climate science community it does indicate that we know less about natural and human climate forcings and feedbacks than concluded in the ipcc reports
2236970 frankly i dont know how to write it and i dont think anybody does
2236971 there will be no climate change legislation coming out of my committee this year
2236972 five or six or seven major ideas that would truly be helpful
2236973 we havent decided yet at this point we do not have a bill planned

2236977 lets be real without getting business on board we cannot achieve anything
2236978 is a semi arid region stretching approximately 5000 km across northern africa from the atlantic ocean in the west to near the red sea in the east and extending roughly from 12 n to 18 n

2236980 several devastating droughts and famines between the late 1960s and early 1990s
2236981 globalwarming awareness2007 can mean colder it can mean drier it can mean wetter thats what were dealing with
2236982 we cannot damage our businesses that must become competitive again
2236983 we keep crying wolf and we keep overstating the doomsday scenario
2236984 expanding nuclear energy is one way that we can actually reduce reliance on fossil fuels in a big way
2236985 its a shame quite frankly that this issue is being played like this at the u n climate change conference it demeans the issue when its so easy to counter a strident assertion with facts
2236986 lets face it the developing countries are not responsible for the problem and yet they are the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change
2236987 women and men are differently affected by climate change and they contribute differently to climate change

2237042 how narrow of god for there to be only way to heaven
2237043 how gracious of god that he would even offer one way
2237044 whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them
2237045 i think it means you should do to others what they do to you
2237046 i think it means you do to others what you want others to do to you
2237047 what about exodus 21 24 eye for an eye tooth for a tooth
2237048 ye have heard it hath been said eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth but i say unto you whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also

2237058 i suggest we make this the last time we deal with this
2237059 hes exactly right i plan on hand delivering this latest version to the state certainly enough is enough we need to get this certified and move on there are other pressing needs we want the staff to work on
2237060 the advantage of getting this certified coming into the 2009 cycle is well really have an opportunity to get a leg up so the next cycle will go much easier
2237061 i think what youre hearing is some of the councils frustration at the bureaucratic process
2237062 the housing element is good in that it outlines the procedures that will allow the city to develop a fair mix of housing but its just a plan it doesnt actually produce housing

2237118 the world wide webs markup language has always been html html was primarily designed as a language for semantically describing scientific documents although its general design and adaptations over the years has enabled it to be used to describe a number of other types of documents the main area that has not been adequately addressed by html is a vague subject referred to as web applications this specification attempts to rectify this while at the same time updating the html specifications to address issues raised in the past few years
2237119 the precedent set here deals with same sex harassment onacle was employed to work on an off shore oil rig drilling in the gulf coast during his time on the rig onacle was threatened with same sex assault by his supervisor and coworkers these were heterosexual men who were trying to sexually assault him the precedent that was set with this case was that sexual harassment goes beyond what is viewed as more traditional form of harassment men harassing women covered under the title vii civil rights act the laws protecting sexual harassment extended to same sex harassment this means that men can be held accountable for harassing men and women can be held liable for harassing women this also does not mean that same sex harassment is homosexual in nature so through this precedent the definition of sexual harassment became broader

2237531 the motivation for the council to hire an in house attorney was the opportunity to save money
2237532 this really reduces the hourly cost of having an attorney
2237533 we did a fairly comprehensive analysis of this and having someone at our fingertips will be an asset to the city
2237534 on the other hand giles is not an expert at every aspect
2237535 litigation costs have risen significantly and my challenges include getting litigation cases against the city resolved and helping the council in its efforts to negotiate the revenue neutrality agreement

2237546 mixed martial arts is too brutal too ugly theres nothing beautiful about it like a nice jab in boxing a few years back they invited me to watch a ufc event but with people getting kicked in the head and punched on the ground i walked out after the third bout it was sickening
2237547 i usually dont like fighting guys with lous style i like guys who are aggressive but the champions now pretty much fight the way lou fights so thats why i chose him

2237549 at the end of the day the silver oak project seemed too large and monstrous for our needs in matawan
2237550 at the time i had no idea of the idiosyncrasies of who the columbia group was connected to
2237551 we have to go back to step one which is a good thing because times have changed and we have a different council now
2237552 that proposal is just the first cut the developer came in with the idea but the governing body never really sat back down with the developer for further discussion
2237553 we cant just look at the tax ratables we have to look at what would best fit the character of the town
2237554 this cannot be decided by six council members and one mayor we cannot decide the future of matawan
2237555 this is the last project that can really improve the town and we need the public input
2237556 we have deferred maintenance needs that exist regardless of whether the state will fund their fair share
2237557 were basically doing deferred maintenance projects most of our construction projects are completed at this point
2237558 we dont want the need to continue to grow without being at least addressed and of course hope springs eternal and sometimes the state changes its mind
2237559 a lot of work had gotten us to this point
2237560 they should aspire to be a board of responsibility and accessibility to their constituents as well as members of the faculty and staff such changes should help to restore confidence in the school board of an extremely successful high school and district
2237561 we certainly hope two new people get voted onto the board who agree the clevenger affair was bungled and the board needs to be more accountable to the people and under more scrutiny
2237562 this is a community problem that has put my business out of business
2237563 theres no way i can reopen my business with the flooding
2237564 its time that the county needs to be held accountable and caltrans they will be held accountable too
2237565 in each of these cases the court finds that the evidence is too speculative
2237566 although plaintiff strenuously and repeatedly argues that his property was not flooded prior to 2004 the evidence to the contrary is overwhelming
2237567 sometimes its a breach of contract somebody can get in trouble with the law or the sales or service departments can not be performing up to standards
2237568 theyve been a valuable asset from the time they came to lompoc so obviously were sorry to see them go
2237569 its always tough to see a local businessman have to close his doors
2237570 in the 2007 calendar year they represented 14 1 percent of our sales tax
2237571 im the type of person who will study a project understand the barriers and strategically overcome them in a unified way
2237572 with my experience and loyalty i will work toward making oceano the best we can be together
2237573 i feel the water rates in oceano are high because we have exhausted so much money on bad studies and surveys and poor contract negotiations legal fees lawsuits and more
2237574 raising rates is the easiest way of generating revenue i feel it should be the last resort
2237575 community drainage has and is a big issue for me and seeing to it that our residents dont have to pay for others mistakes prompted me to run
2237576 to achieve this we need a stable efficient and well run district
2237577 this is an ongoing process and has always been at the top of my priority list i am always working closely with staff other agencies and elected officials to ensure that the district funds are wisely spent

2237585 investigators believe benoit killed his wife amp son then himself
2237586 when we first began hiring for the position there were two applicants that were both very qualified
2237587 i have more time than most people and i enjoy working with the kids
2237588 it is a second job for me and it is close to home
2237589 unclear and that the new policy would make rules easier to understand

2237603 i would love to get out there get in one of the cars and see it go up to 210 mph
2237604 quite frankly when he went back in 2005 thats when we learned most of it about him
2237605 what a remarkably strong man he was and his brilliant brilliant memory
2237606 he always liked to say he was still farm boy a heart

2237611 when we first found out we were shocked we were devastated
2237612 the doctor just told us to go home and love our baby that was all we could do
2237613 we talked to about five different people around the country and they all said the same thing
2237614 we needed to get her breathing assistance and we needed to get her a surgery so she could eat if we didnt her time would be less
2237615 there was something we could do instead of just sitting here and waiting
2237616 it has to have been done its such a close knit community
2237617 we just threw one together did a little research on what company to use to host it and sent it to our contacts
2237618 we set our initial goal at 1 000 signatures and we reached it in four days

2237636 monmouth county directed counsel to investigate the history and accuracy of the fema mapping process in june we have also begun a thorough assessment of the engineering standards and assumptions used by the army corps of engineers when they constructed the existing flood control structures our goal in all of this is to protect the lives and property of our residents with or without flood insurance and by doing so eliminate the need for this added expense
2237637 in this effort we are working closely with assemblywoman amy handlin and senator joe kyrillos county engineer joseph ettore and assistant county counsel gil messina and i will be meeting with dr tavit o najarian of najarian associates a civil engineering and environmental consulting firm based in eatontown to review information about the proposed fema maps we will also be meeting with congressman frank pallone who is offering some support for our efforts
2237638 although what congressman pallone is proposing will help it is primarily a short term measure while we welcome such assistance for our monmouth county residents our long term objective is to prevent flooding from ever occurring with the firm belief that it is better to have no flooding and need no insurance then to have your home flooded with insurance in hand

2237691 i am bound as a pastor by divine command to give my life for those whom i love and that is all salvadoreans even those who are going to kill me
2237692 these words appeared in a newspaper just two weeks before archbishop romero was shot while celebrating holy communion in the hospital which had been his home since his enthronement in 1977
2237693 oscar arnulfo romero y goldamez was born in 1917 in the town of cindad barrios in the mountains of el salvador near the border with honduras leaving school at twelve he began an apprenticeship as a carpenter showing promise as a craftsman but soon thought about ordination although his family were not keen he trained at san miguel and san salvador before completing his theological studies in rome because of the war in europe there was no member of his family at his ordination in 1942
2237694 the fundamental delusion of humanity is to suppose that i am here and you are out there
2237695 visiting the pope in 1979 archbishop romero presented him with seven dossiers filled with reports and documents describing injustices in el salvador less than a year later he was killed
2237696 in the sermon just minutes before his death archbishop romero reminded his congregation of the parable of the wheat
2237697 and now we need to ask for what purpose should we commemorate msgr romero and the most obvious answer is to put him to work
2237698 monse or is well used when our memory of him promotes all that has to do with hope courage and commitment
2237699 romeros memory incarnated in the poor of el salvador and all of latin america is a call to us and an invitation to join the poor on this faith journey to be converted to accompany them as they struggle for the fulfillment of their hope thats why the international community also celebrates the anniversary of his death each year to acknowledge that in oscar romero a prophet did indeed come into the world and that hearing him accepting his judgment on the world his pronouncement of what sin is and the causes of that sin and allowing ourselves to be converted and changed by it has become critical to the authenticity of our own faith

2237833 i grew up in an alcoholic and abusive background and lacked self esteem and love i began discovering all that the devil had in the world beginning with pornography i was preaching at the time and my conscience rebuked me with great pain after each incident
2237834 in tears of sincerity i confessed my sins and asked for gods forgiveness but the temptation always returned even stronger a powerful wicked force was driving me into the mud of moral impurity i hated what was happening and tried many things to change but nothing worked
2237835 finally i was able to attend my first basic seminar1 and heard the principle of meditation and engrafting romans 6 into my heart i began by making a list of every past sin i could think of and tracing these sins to their root causes confessing each one
2237836 i wrote out each verse of romans 6 on a card and recited it many times until i had a pretty good grasp of it
2237837 sometimes i fell into sin and became discouraged again but i decided that this time i would continue to meditate even if i failed instead of giving up because of my sins i pressed harder to come under the authority of gods word
2237838 by the second week of meditating day and night my peace and joy began to grow by the third week i sensed a newness of spirit a freshness about life and a positive perspective i couldnt believe how good i felt inside

2237936 every time you send me a text message its followed immediately by another one clarifying what youre trying to say
2237937 o lord deliver me from this lust of always vindicating myself
2237938 whosoever commits sin transgress the law for sin is the transgression of the law
2237939 for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all
2237940 knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin
2237941 the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good
2237942 for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin
2237943 for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all
2237944 therefore see why in chapter one you are inexcusable o man whoever you are that judges for where in you judge another you condemn yourself for you that judge are doing the same things
2237945 it is not the lifestyle of the child of god born again to live in the pigpen
2237946 out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks
2237947 if your heart keeps right if your heart keeps right
2237948 the steps of the godly are directed by the lord
2237949 do unto others as you would have them do unto you
2237950 for i have no man likeminded who will naturally care for your state for all seek their own not the things which are jesus christs
2237951 for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
2237952 and if it ever stops being fun quit life is too short to do things you dont like doing
2237953 heres what you need to do and here is why

2237956 they can offshore my job any day of the week
2237957 and of course when you fix a router it doesnt say thanks
2237958 they want to make sure you will be the right fit
2237959 it helps provide the scope and breadth of your accomplishments
2237960 and it shows you very clearly understand what youve done
2237961 im not going to be a hermit in a cubicle
2237962 if you want to be a brand manager you need to talk like one
2237963 it may be someone i read about or hear speak
2237964 i tell them what im trying to do and ask if theyll coach me along it doesnt always work but everyone gives me little tidbits
2237965 every career is composed of two main factors a job title and a particular industry
2237966 an easier way to transition is to change just one of those factors at a time
2237967 but in the meantime i was training and saving money it was very hard for me to close the doors of my practice but once i did i never looked back
2237968 he has nothing left for life but his prejudices his principles and his common sense

2237972 so lets say i am the one that raised with pp 10s and i get a caller the button calls the raise everyone else folds my first thought is my opponent isnt on pp qs or higher if so they probably would have re raised maybe pp as being slow played but usually that doesnt happen
2237973 im pleased to announce a new feature of our on going
2237974 its yet another step to modernize the canadian postal system and satisfy our customers
2237975 every year thousands of canadians are on the go people who must relocate for work or other reasons
2237976 so it is with great pride and pleasure i tell you that starting next month the national portable postal codes program will commence in ontario every month after that it will expand to include another province and territory until everyone in canada can take their postal code with them wherever they chose with it canadian citizens will be able to keep their present postal codes wherever they chose to live across the country or across town
2237977 this is like kinkos expanding its reproductive services to include gynecology
2237978 call me old fashioned but our canadian postal codes were meant to stay put
2237979 they serve a clear unambiguous purpose they tell the postal worker on his or her route where you live when i return to ottawa at the end of march to postal code k1a 0a4 to be exact im certain ill be thinking long and hard of maybe voting against it unless i hear some pretty darn good reasons for any change to something that works if it works why change it
2237980 i use to spend my winters ice fishing with friends on the ottawa river but my company moved me to toronto which was hard enough but then the post office said i had to change my postal code i couldnt be k1s 3y1 anymore and that really hurt it was like i was out on the ottawa river fishing you know and suddenly like the ice wasnt here
2237981 they didnt understand that people work hard to get an r3c 4l8 postal code moving shouldnt disconnect them from that part of their lives postal codes are no different than names you wouldnt want the government to tell you that you had to change your name when you moved to winnipeg would you so why should you be shamed by being stripped of the postal code you may have grown up with when you move i applaud this new plan
2237982 sense of his own beauty came on him like a revelation
2237983 it was his duty to confess to suffer public shame and to make public atonement
2237984 at the sudden impression that lord henrys words had produced
2237985 suit his various moods and the changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed at times to have almost entirely lost control

2237993 the findings are of no surprise to us at st michaels hospice family is certainly a very important focus for our patients and is a significant part of our work here it is essential for people to be listened to and feel cared for and through our in patient day care and community nursing services we provide care that matches individuals needs and wishes world hospice and palliative care day is an important date in the calendar as it is an opportunity to celebrate hospice and palliative care across the world here at st michaels hospice we will be marking this occasion together with our 15 th anniversary by opening our doors to the public to show people a bit more about how we help to care for local people suffering from a life limiting illness
2237994 while acknowledging that this is a great achievement for st michaels hospice and the community it serves what makes it extra special is that so many of our volunteers have been with us a good 5 to 10 years some even started behind the scenes before the hospice was built it really is the least we can do to recognise all that hard work and commitment these wonderful people have given us
2237995 i am delighted that the volunteers have been recognised for their support and we have taken this opportunity to present some very special long service awards to people who probably think they are fairly ordinary but who i know to be extremely generous extraordinary individuals during the afternoon we will also be presenting a very special posthumous award in honour of jane house a remarkable lady who gave so much to st michaels
2237996 each week volunteers freely give over 800 hours of their time to st michaels hospice which over a year equates to in financial terms half a million pounds worth of support a cost which if added to our 2 million running costs would be impossible to sustain
2237997 put on therefore as elect of god holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness long suffering forbearing on another and
2237998 when jesus saw their faith he said unto the sick of palsy son the sins be forgiven you
2237999 whosoever sins you remit they are remitted unto them and whosesoever sins you retain they are retained
2238000 he that believes on the son of god has life he that believes not the wrath of god abides on him
2238001 god demonstrates his love for us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us
2238002 a brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city and their contentions are like the bars of a castle
2238003 when will this person be most open and responsive to my appeal for reconciliation
2238004 what man is he that desireth life and loveth many days that he may see good seek peace and pursue it
2238005 laura have you ever forgiven your husband for all his many faults
2238006 laura would you think about what ive said today and would you promise to come back and see me next week
2238007 youve got to tell me about what happened to laura
2238008 shes changed so much its made me realize what a rotten husband ive been these past years pastor i have a drinking problem and i need help with it
2238009 do you realize what you told god in that prayer
2238010 forgive us our debts as in the same way we forgive our debtors
2238011 then his lord said unto him o thou wicked servant i forgave thee all that debt shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant even as i had pity on thee and his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses
2238012 have you forgiven your husband as jesus commanded us to
2238013 i have forgiven him many times but he keeps hurting me
2238014 as far as the east is from the west so far hath he god removed our transgressions from us
2238015 all whom my father has given entrusted to me will come to me and i will most certainly not cast out i will never no never reject one of them who comes to me
2238016 he does not crush the weak or quench the smallest hope
2238017 now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin
2238018 and so we know and rely on the love god has for us god is love whoever lives in love lives in god and god in him in this way love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgement because in this world we are like him there is no fear in love but perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment the one who fears is not made perfect in love
2238019 the lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous in mercy he will not always chide neither will he keep his anger for ever he hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities for as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy toward them that fear him as far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our transgressions from us like as a father pitieth his children so the lord pitieth them that fear him
2238020 the lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit
2238021 i have swept away your offenses like a cloud your sins like the morning mist return to me for i have redeemed you
2238022 he will turn again he will have compassion upon us he will subdue our iniquities and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea
2238023 bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases
2238024 for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed
2238025 for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him
2238026 love endures long and is patient and kind love never is envious nor boils over with jealousy it is not boastful or vainglorious does not display itself haughtily it is not conceited arrogant and inflated with pride it is not rude unmannerly and does not act unbecomingly love gods love in us does not insist on its own rights or its own way for it is not self seeking it is not touchy or fretful or resentful it takes no account of the evil done to it pays no attention to a suffered wrong it does not rejoice at injustice and unrighteousness but rejoices when right and truth prevail love bears up under anything and everything that comes is ever ready to believe the best about every person its hopes are fadeless under all circumstances and it endures everything without weakening love never fails never fades out or becomes obsolete or comes to an end
2238027 dear heavenly father thank you for your grace and mercy to me forgive me for my hardness of heart which i have displayed to others as well as you cleanse me of all self absorption self pity anger hatred bitterness vengefulness hopelessness and resentment help me to walk in your love and to know your love in my own heart though i dont have it within me i know that you have it within you and that you share your power with the weak i confess my weakness and i look to you to make me strong in love patience longsuffering and humility i look to all the testing of my faith as something good for you know it will make me stronger in it you are rich in mercy and will not chide and scold forever im calling on you for forgiveness and the strength to believe your word and to follow it now lord please send me the power of the holy spirit to strengthen me so i can follow through with all youve put in my heart help me not to stumble back into my old ways but walk in the newness of life that you have promised those who are born again let my life be the very fragrance of grace to all i meet let me show others the kind of love that you have shown me thank you for your faithfulness lord i cling to your mercy and love you with all my heart

2238031 i was in berlin with a man who is considered one of the foremost authorities on nazi germany colonel eugene byrd who was the commandant of the spandau prison which housed all the war criminals after the war
2238032 that he had the greatest insight into what happened spiritually there
2238033 there are dozens of organizations which use the name symbols and traditions of the order of malta in an unauthorized fashion
2238034 the organizations listed below have no affiliation with the order of malta and are not recognized by the vatican
2238035 the order of malta was admitted to the united nations as a permanent observer on august 24 1994
2238036 official diplomatic relations with over eighty states and international organizations
2238037 im sitting in the lobby nuremberg germany with bobby conner and a few other people there and this guy comes walking in the lobby of the hotel who was an interesting looking guy and reed who was paul cains assistant was standing behind me and he said hey theres newman peyton and this guy was baron newman peyton who colonel byrd had told me was looking for me i said reed do you know that man he said oh yeah we met him years ago and he came over walked over to me and said he had been looking to meet with me and i stopped him right away i said bobby give me a readout on this guy and this guys going whats a readout laughter and bobby goes sir when you came in i just saw something i saw that you had just come from the office of a man named kurt waldheim and his eyes got real big cause he had just come from his kurt waldheim office and then he bobby conner said i saw you or i saw him opening this briefcase and giving you something out of it and bobby described the briefcase and his eyes got real big then he said this is incredible he baron peyton said that is the only briefcase like that in the world i had it custom made for kurt waldheim and it was a weird thing bobby had described
2238038 has been barred from entering the united states since 1987 as a suspected war criminal
2238039 the knighting of kurt waldheim also shows that the hatred of jews is still no impediment to the esteem of the church catholic some say it was waldheims only qualification
2238040 bobby told him a little bit more about the papers and everything and it really got his attention he was captured from then on and he was a prophetic man he was the one who prophesied to indira gandhi that if she did not give her heart to the lord she would be dead in one week five days later she was assassinated and he is a friend with head of number of the moslem nations as well as other countries and hes been a prophetic voice to them but he had never seen the gift operate like this in such a specific way about details like that so he was just captured this worked out strategically in a way you wouldnt believe it was important but this was the guy who was key to getting paul cain an audience with saddam hussein you may have heard us talk about that and paul went saddam hussein some of his guys had been in a meeting had seen the prophetic gift operate and they were utterly convinced that paul is a true prophet saddam became convinced and he wanted to meet with paul okay it all worked out well newman was the guy who worked this out and right after he sent the fax to start this process all this fear came on him what have i done this could really mess up world events and things like that he didnt know paul cain that well and right after that the lord had told bobby conner to fax newman peyton and just write this that paul cain is my man hes okay dont worry about it or something like that so newman sends this fax to make this connection between paul and saddam to work out this thing and hes sitting there going oh no what have i done cant get the fax back another fax comes in dont worry paul cains okay you know i mean its exactly on time they still have the little strips of paper he sent one out one minute later one comes in this is it so these things happen strategically anyway we went on and a bunch of us got knighted by these knights of malta okay i did first and i wasnt even going to do it i thought it was a great honor and all but i just dont join things like that anyway paul cain called me from austria and said you know just tuned in on it and said the lord is going to give you some credentials like pauls credentials where his roman citizenship really was used at times and he said youre really supposed to do this thing so i did and then later some of the other guys we even got bobby connor knighted and steve and leonard anyway we had a big time bobby we dubbed sir bubba and mahesh chavada became sir loin we seriously polluted the blue blood of europe i mean it was bad ricky skaggs you know country singer aw man it was a blast we had a great time though anyway we got knighted by this thing its a real this somehow is real important to the lord hes kept this order in existence i think like he has israel it has an end times purpose and destiny they went on made me a knight commander which gave me authority to knight others and then they made me something else where i have authority over all the knights supposedly in the u s
2238041 no connection whatsoever with any legitimate order of chivalry of that name
2238042 one of more than 20 similar bodies which misuse the name of st john to distribute invented titles and worthless knighthoods
2238043 i have a concern about it its a secret society
2238044 i wouldnt touch that stuff i absolutely came out strong against it
2238045 it is an elitist club people started vying for position so they could be knighted the ones that were knighted had a special bond with rick
2238046 its hard to believe i would say that but i believe there are some volatile things that could be used for good or evil
2238047 i think it could be used to bring some healing and reconciliation i think some of the most volatile things ive ever said prophetically are going to be in this book i hope only the most mature people read it
2238048 theres going to be some shocking things many christians especially charismatic christians tend to be ignorant of history i just feel i was under compulsion and obedience to do this book
2238049 but it is hard to turn on christian television without seeing an evangelist who claims that if people will just give to his ministry they will receive special blessings from god is this not the same abomination of selling the grace of god
2238050 we therefore do not believe that paul has committed anything that places him beyond the grace of god

2238058 let this mind be in you that is christ jesus
2238059 my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways says the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
2238060 then he came unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry you here and watch with me and he went a little farther and fell on his face and prayed saying o my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as you will and he came unto his disciples and found them asleep and said to peter what could you not watch with me one hour intimacy watch and pray that you enter not into temptation good reason to be in a secret place o prayer the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak he went away again the second time and prayed saying o my father if this cup may pass away except i drink it your will be done and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy and he left them and went away again and prayed the third time saying the same words
2238061 my house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations

2238064 a cathedral not made with hands eternal in the heavens
2238065 let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight o lord my strength and my redeemer
2238066 by sacrificing whole burnt offerings and aromatic incense to god daily morning and evening prayers setting our fresh holy bread on a clean table and lighting lamps on golden stands every night we continue doing what told us to do in the way he told us to do it but you have rid yourselves of him
2238067 thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
2238068 father please reign over my world but more personally please reign in my life today
2238069 father i failed to act as the person you have declared me to be im sorry
2238070 for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever
2238071 dont you know you are a temple of the holy spirit
2238072 and he took the scroll the twenty four elders fell down before the lamb each with a harp and golden vial filled with incense the prayers of gods people
2238073 likewise the spirit also helps our infimities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered and he that searches the heart knows the mind of the spirit because he makes intercession for the saints according to the will of god
2238074 let this mind be in you that is in christ jesus
2238075 your father knows the things you have need of before you ask him
2238076 if god had granted all the silly prayers ive made in my life where should i be now
2238077 we will give ourselves to prayer and the ministry of the word
2238078 and i sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that i should not destroy it but i found none how sad ezekiel 23 30
2238079 and he spoke a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not faint saying there was in a city a judge which feared not god neither regarded man and there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me my adversary and he would not for awhile but afterwards he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man yet because this widow troubles me i will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me and the lord said hear what the unjust judge says and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry out day and night unto him though he bear long with them i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man comes shall he find faith on the earth
2238080 i exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men for kings and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and honesty for this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our savior who will have all men to be saved and come unto the knowledge of the truth for there is one god and mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
2238081 and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not as we have opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them that are of the household faith
2238082 praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints
2238083 cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers
2238084 and in that day you shall ask me nothing truthfully i truly say unto you whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he will give it to you hitherto have you asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full
2238085 and i say unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and you will find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that asks receives and he that seeks finds and to him that knocks it shall be opened
2238086 if we would draw near to you you would be near to us
2238087 i know and i love you and even though you are angry now i am doing what is best for you because you are my child i cant help by want the best for you
2238088 watch and pray that you enter not into temptation the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak
2238089 jesus cried out with tears to him who is able to save him from death
2238090 the increasing list of people places amp events to be prayed for is nevertheless one of the burdens of old age i have a scruple about crossing anyone off the list when i say a scruple i mean precisely a scruple i dont think that if one prays for a man at all it is a duty to pray for him all my life but when it comes to dropping him now this particular day it somehow goes against the grain and as the list lengthens it is hard to make it more than just a string of names but herein to some measure a curious law comes into play dont you find that if you keep your mind fixed upon god you will automatically think of the person you are praying for but that there is no tendency for it to work the other way around
2238091 one of his disciples asked him teach us to pray
2238092 casting all our cares upon him for he cares for us
2238093 we know not what we should pray as we ought but he the spirit himself makes intercession for us with groaning which cannot be uttered
2238094 he the spirit who lives in you makes intercession for the saints according to the will of god
2238095 my house shall be called a house of prayer but you have made it a den of thieves
2238096 know you not that your body is the temple of the holy spirit
2238097 what manner of persons ought we to be our responsibility
2238098 not willing that any should perish but all come to repentance
2238099 offered up prayers and supplications with vehement cries and tears to him who was able to save him from death
2238100 could you not keep watch with me one hour watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak
2238101 continue in prayer and watch in the same with thanksgiving withal praying also for us that god would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of christ
2238102 be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be known unto god
2238103 therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed the prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective james 5 13 16
2238104 as day and night i constantly remember you in my prayers recalling your tears longing to see you so that i may be filled with joy
2238105 he shall keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on him
2238106 looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith
2238107 and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certian place when he ceased one of the disciples said to him lord teach us to pray as john also taught his disciples and he said to them when you pray say our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in earth give us day by day our daily bread and forgive us our sins for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil
2238108 the father which is in secret shall reward you openly
2238109 he that dwells in the secret place of the most high shall dwell uder the shadow of the almighty
2238110 he shall call upon me i will be with him in trouble and honor him
2238111 and when you pray you shall not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the street that they may be seen of men truly i tell you they have their reward
2238112 as stewards it is more that a man be found faithful
2238113 both the one who makes men holy and those who are made holy are of the same family so jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers
2238114 the things we have seen and heard we will pass on to others who are able to pass along to others also
2238115 let us then feel very sure that we can come before gods throne where there is grace
2238116 when you pray pray like this our father who is in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
2238117 come my king take your throne in our land be present in my heart be present in my office come into my marriage be lord of my family my fears and my doubts
2238118 continuous inner conversation with god and in perfect response to his will
2238119 it is good for us to keep some account of our prayers that we may not unsay them is our practice
2238120 dont be weary in prayer keep at it watch for gods answers and remember to be thankful when they come
2238121 but god not only heard me he listened to my prayer blessed by god who neither ignored my prayer nor deprived me of his love
2238122 the increasing list of people places amp events to be prayed for is nevertheless one of the burdens of old age i have a scruple about crossing anyone off the list when i say a scruple i mean precisely a scruple i dont think that if one prays for a man at all it is a duty to pray for him all my life but when it comes to dropping him now this particular day it somehow goes against the grain and as the list lengthens it is hard to make it more than just a string of names but herein to some measure a curious law comes into play dont you find that if you keep your mind fixed upon god you will automatically think of the person you are praying for but that there is no tendency for it to work the other way around
2238123 we know that in everything god works for good with those who love him who are called according to his purpose for those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son
2238124 be very careful when you try to be so good in performance of prayer that you get applause from men thats all you will get for it
2238125 it is he that has made us and not we ourselves
2238126 our father lord not only our four and no more our spouse and family but our neighbors friends and in our community those who rule over us in on our job in our schools our state and our nation as we think of whose we are we lift up these family names to you today it is you who made us to be
2238127 i will praise you o lord my god i will praise you with all my heart i will glorify your name forever more i will glorify your name forever more
2238128 hallelujah hallelujah worthy is the lamb worthy is the lamb you are holy holy holy
2238129 does god actually hear prayer does he really answer prayer
2238130 when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly
2238131 the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much makes much power available
2238132 o lord hear o lord forgive o lord hearken and do defer not for thine own sake o my god
2238133 hallowed be thy name for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory
2238134 elias was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit
2238135 the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much
2238136 this is too big for me i need your help
2238137 i will confess all secret sins and do your will
2238138 i am not worthy to receive the power of your grace
2238139 you are the only one who has the power and resources to help me
2238140 i need help right now or i am without hope

2238156 what a wretched man i am who will rescue me from this body of death
2238157 how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him
2238158 for a while i was a teacher and i loved teaching but i couldnt make a living at it and i decided to join my father in law who is in the construction business
2238159 as christians we are in a difficult situation here in israel unfortunately the moslems and especially the extreme islamist section are giving the tone here my family who lived in bethlehem probably since the crusaders had to flee for their life the moslems have been forcing us out by threats and even murder bethlehem that was once predominantly christian is now predominantly moslem very little is written about it even in the israeli press
2238160 i have to tell you something which very few of you seem to comprehend
2238161 your bungling war against a few thousand hezbollah fighters which you should have crushed no matter what considering the importance of the outcome has created a completely new situation not only for this area but global ly your inept leadership totally misunderstood the importance of winning this war as a matter of fact the whole moslem world not only the arabs simply couldnt believe that the mighty israeli army that defeated the combined arab forces in six days in 1967 and almost captured cairo and damascus in 1973 couldnt defeat a small army of hezbollah men
2238162 as usual the moslems see things the way they want to see things most think that the present generation of israelis have gone soft and can be defeated the american bungling of the war in iraq only added to their conviction that victory not only over israel but also over the west is not only possible but certain
2238163 the ramifications of these two bungling wars may bring an islamic bloody tsunami all over the west not only in israel the sharks smell bloo d and these two wars gave them the green light to attack sooner than they had in mind your problem is that you are on the defensive and they have the option to choose the time and the places when and where to attack and there is nothing much you can do about it when will you westerners realize that half measures dont work with people who are willing to die by the thousands for allah to achieve their goal in their eyes the western world is simply an abomination on earth that has to be wiped out
2238164 the americans the europeans and even you israelis really dont really know what it is all about do you during the last generation hundreds of thousands of children have been taught all over the moslem world in madrass schools to become martyrs for allah in order to kill the infidels these youngsters are not only ready to do it but are actually in the process of doing it bombs are going off all over the world killing and maiming thousands of people not only on 9 11 in the us in london madrid and bali but africa india bengla dash egypt saudi arabia and countless other places
2238165 the first signs of the islamic tsunami is already here but the west doesnt understand or doesnt want to understand what is coming the americans instead of realizing that this is as bad as world war two or even worse are going to pull out of iraq handing it over to iran on a silver platter next may come the saudis and the rest of the gulf states
2238166 when dirty bombs will go off all over the western towns who is going to stop the iranians now is the time to stop them not only because they are developing nuclear bombs but because iran has become the base for all islamic terrorist they supply money men and weapons to islamic terrorist around the world quite often through their diplomatic mail billions of petro dollars that are pouring into iran are being funneled into terrorist organizations worldwide they believe and perhaps rightly so that the west will do nothing to stop them in achieving their goals is history repeating itself are the iranians making the same mistake that hitler made when he attacked poland is the situation similar
2238167 as a history teacher who studied the subject thoroughly i can tell you that western victory in world war two was not all certain hitler could have won the war if he would have gone ahead with the atomic bomb development before the americans the germans began working on it in the thirties and it was hitlers decision to prefer building more conventional arms as he considered atomic weapons sheer fantasy hitler made the wrong decision but had he made the right decision the world would have been a different type of world today wouldnt it the west won the war against hitler by sheer chance very few people seem to realize that
2238168 i see that my words are not wasted on you
2238169 coming back to our time the iranians rely on the west doing nothing about their development of nuclear bombs they also rely on their secret weapon an inexhaustible supply of islamic suicide bombers some of them who are already planted all over the western world
2238170 besides the islamic countries that supply these suicide bombers a second front has been opened and that is the internet with more than five thousand islamic web sites brain washing and urging young moslems to become martyrs for allah they especially target young moslems who live in europe and the west in general the western intelligence authorities consider these web sites a bigger threat than the iranian atomic bomb al qaida recently issued a television broadcast that promised a devastating attack against its enemies this spring as we all know al qaida doesnt make empty threats
2238171 actually i dont understand why the iranians bother to develop atom bombs and bring the whole world down on them every suicide bomber is a potential atom bomb or a biological chemical or dirty bomb that can be no less devastating than an atom bomb the americans and europeans have no defense against this type of war
2238172 and who would you call the forces of good israel or islam
2238173 if i were a moslem i would have no problem to name the forces of good and it wouldnt be israel as a christian i would probably name israel but as a christian arab i would prefer not to answer
2238174 i think there are two ways to avoid it one can be a major war which the west can win as in world war two had the west attacked the germans in 1936 the war would have lasted not more than a month with very few casualties thei r procrastination resulted in world war ii with all its consequences
2238175 eventually the west will have to tackle the iranians it is better that they do it now to avert a world catastrophe later with iran defeated the islamic onslaught will lose its base and it may be the turning point in history to defeat the menace of extreme islam the majority of the moslems dont want this confrontation anyway
2238176 you are painting a rather dark picture when do you think we will have the next round against hezbollah
2238177 i think they will attack again as soon as they are fully re equipped and i think it will be during the summer while israel is still in a military and political turmoil
2238178 i know what i am going to do i am going to canada to join my brother this country is becoming much too dangerous for christians as well he said he thanked me for the coffee and we shook hands
2238179 sure all the west has to do is follow putins ways he assassinates his enemies without blinking an eye assassinate the four or five mullahs who run the show achmenijad and a few more iranian fanatics and the war can be avoided it may be difficult to do but not impossible with todays hi tech technology i am sure that new weapons against individuals are being prepared right now i think it would be a better way of handling the matter than an all out war against islam

2238218 the objectives of these exercises are to improve the way the horse moves through loosening his back all grids to teach the horse how to collect and lengthen stride grids 7 22 to improve his ability to bend and change bend grids 11 26 28 to teach the horse to shift his weight in the canter to the hind end grid 9 and to give a new way to practice some movements grids 12 13 14 these exercises also give the dressage student and horse a change of pace
2238219 these exercise are based on the fact that the exaggerated movement of the horse through the cavalletti will strengthen the hind leg muscles and will loosen the horses back this will result in an improved ability to move and to shift the center of balance toward the hind end these exercises also require a great deal of focus on the part of the horse and rider and will improve the ability of both to concentrate several exercises will also focus on giving the horse a reason to bend correctly it is significantly easier to go through curved cavalletti patterns if the horse is bending correctly dressage cavalletti can also give the rider the chance to learn to feel if the horse is moving straight as crooked movement will cause him to move away from the center of the cavalletti while going through the grid horses that have difficulty learning that lengthening is not going faster and collection is not going slower will be able to better grasp this concept by using the grids which have longer and shorter stride lengths set in them the student can also use these grids as a way of learning to feel if the tempo remains the same when lengthening or shortening because the work of achieving the difference in stride length is accomplished by the grid and the rider has more time available to feel what is happening cavalletti work can be very useful also when the horse rider combination is stuck in a rut and needs to do something completely different in order to progress

2238227 i place no value on anything i have or possess except in relationship to gods kingdom
2238228 but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things shall be added to you
2238229 i press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of god in christ jesus

2238232 i have fought the good fight i have finished the course i have kept the faith in the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge will award to me on that day and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing

2238446 en vista de una posible convocatoria para la copa am rica creo que no estar a en las condiciones ideales para ofrecer el rendimiento que se espera de m a nivel internacional
2238447 el t cnico tambi n consider que la decisi n de kak abre una oportunidad para probar a otros jugadores
2238448 dunga manifest que le gustar a poder contar con todos los jugadores en la copa am rica ya que sta ser la primera competencia oficial despu s del mundial donde el equipo brasile o no dio lo que todos esperaban
2238449 no queremos a un jugador que no desea representar a brasil que no siente placer por estar ah
2238450 mientras yo est a cargo los jugadores deber n entregar su cuerpo alma y coraz n a la selecci n nacional
2238451 kamu juga imut banget temen temen kak di skul ga ada deh yang cute nya kayak kamu
2238452 ga boleh kata mama ga boleh pacaran sampe tamat sma
2238453 kak udah dulu ya charol suka banget deh sama kakak
2238454 ive reached the pinnacle of my sporting career what shall i do now i know ill dress in purple lycra and do gay twirls on ice in an attempt to be loved by the public again i need their love because i am so pathetic
2238455 there is someone i once saw on telly wow she is average at ice skating how entertaining much better than watching quality professional ice skaters the mere fact that she has been in a soap opera means i cant wait to see her progress from being shit at ice skating to mediocre at ice skating
2238456 hi judges i know i have an average voice but i look great and my mum just died in a tragic skydiving accident and ive only got one leg but my singing has got me through it all even the diagnosis that im hiv positive
2238457 none are as hopelessly enslaved as those who falsely believe they are free
2238458 we do not intend to live in a city where the color of your skin means youre suspect more than anybody else
2238459 a smart attorney knows the law and a good attorney knows the judge
2238460 that peter j pinckney who investigated the murder had dismissed a firefighters suspicions about mr benchs involvement because he knew mr bench and thought him incapable of killing anyone
2238461 coming from the man who was put behind box no one cant feel worse than mr brown he suffered 15 years for crime he didnt even know existed and he is not the first one as a matter of fact he is the 8th person in new york exonerated through dna this is evidence of the inefficiency of the almighty criminal justice board millions of people depend on this system for justice to be brought forward but one case of exoneration two cases now even 8 cases of exoneration is terribly disappointed would the innocent be able to see the light of justice these 8 innocent lives have wasted their time in jail when they would have been doing something more meaningful in their lives contributing to society but instead they were for so many years wrongly accused for a crime they never committed who is responsible for the lost time and youth of these 8 people if money was the compensation how much would be acceptable and what use is this money if they have lost their love ones and the chance to have their own families
2238462 an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth
2238463 he mr dibiagio was a good prosecutor but he did not play politics well and that was his downfall
2238464 its not about what you know but who you know
2238465 in the first six months of 2006 new york city continued to get safer even as violent crime continues to increase nationally
2238466 police officials say the violence tends to happen among young men in their late teens and early to mid 20s in some cases it is random but in many cases it is among people who know one another or between gangs as a way to settle disputes arguments that 20 years ago would have led to fistfights police chiefs say now lead to guns
2238467 were looking to see what more we can do to raise revenue through station advertising
2238468 we have a livestock market here every legi you can sell or buy livestock here other places however have their own days
2238469 the price will be around rp 600 000 to rp 800 000 ahead of idul adha
2238470 how do we respond to these very radical cultural shifts
2238471 why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners
2238472 those who are well have no need of a physician but those who are sick i have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
2238473 it is easier to fight for ones principles than to live up to them
2238474 to find the secret word look near a lively game pointing to the path with a rabbit in its name
2238475 pointing to the path with a rabbit in its name
2238476 apa kamu merasakn pedih di hati saat sesuatu yang berharga hilang dalam diirimu
2238477 39 b l m sefa hastaneye kald r l r
2238478 mas tadi di cari sama bu asti beliau nunggu di ruangannya mas
2238479 kenapa beberapa minggu ini kamu sering telat kamu bisa keruangan saya untuk menjelaskannya
2238480 hiyde penjualan kamu bulan ini juga berantkan terus kamu sering telat kalau kaya gini terus kamu bisa kena pecat saya harus menutupi di depan manager beberapa minggu ini kamu kenapa minggu ini
2238481 ok gini aja kamu saya kasih waktu satu bulan untuk menyelesaikan semua masalah ini kalau kamu gak bisa terpaksa saya memecat kamu
2238482 i dont care if you dont and i still dont care if you do
2238483 who else would care who tell me come on just tell me you can tell me
2238484 who else would care if you gained like what five pounds as long as i think you are beautiful isnt that all that matters you dont have to worry about looking good for other guys or girls as long as i think you beautiful who else would care who else would you want to care who just tell me a name you can tell me
2238485 no really i cant im sorry im sorry im sorry im so sorry
2238486 dont be sorry just tell me look at me dont hide like that
2238487 there is nothing good nor bad but thinking makes it so
2238488 there is nothing good nor bad but thinking makes it so
2238489 the more choices you give people the harder it is for them to choose and the unhappier theyll feel
2238490 the fact that you have to choose between nine different ways of turning off your computer every time just on the start menu not to mention the choice of hitting the physical on off button or closing the laptop lid produces just a little bit of unhappiness every time
2238491 switch user and lock can be combined by letting a second user log on when the system is locked that would probably save a lot of forced logouts anyway another option down
2238492 once youve merged switch user and lock do you really need log off the only thing log off gets you is that it exits all running programs but so does powering off so if youre really concerned about exiting all running programs just power off and on again one more option gone
2238493 restart can be eliminated 95 of the time you need this its because of an installation which prompted you to restart anyway for the other cases you can just turn the power off and then turn it on again another option goes away less choice less pain
2238494 of course you should eliminate the distinction between the icons and the menu
2238495 what if we combined sleep hibernate switch user and lock modes
2238496 so if windows used ram that was effectively nonvolatile by swapping memory out to flash drives during idle time effectively you would be able to remove power whenever youre in
2238497 most golfers just have parts set up mechanics etc theyre all just parts the tempo is the glue that makes the parts whole
2238498 i dont have time for other thoughts i can swing freely
2238499 there she is miss a mer ica there she is our ideal

2238501 they lower their dignities because they are not self esteemed
2238502 wegen seines geschlechtes seiner abstammung seiner rasse seiner sprache seiner heimat und herkunft seines glaubens seiner religi sen oder politischen anschauungen benachteiligt oder bevorzugt werden
2238503 and if someone asks about your christian hope always be ready to explain it
2238504 it is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it
2238505 its become the biggest selling item in the 30 year history of our store
2238506 the ownership of money and property comes as a result of doing things in a certain way those who do things in this certain way whether on purpose or accidentally get rich those who do not do things in this certain way no matter how hard they work or how able they are remain poor it is a natural law that like causes always produce like effects therefore any man or woman who learns to do things in this certain way will infallibly get rich
2238507 god put me here so i could get closer to him
2238508 god is sovereign and can allow sickness if he so desires for a specific individual

2238542 est avanzando hacia posibles rupturas ahora se sigue formando el t nel y en uno o dos d as m s se tiene que caer
2238543 es la primera vez que el glaciar rompe en invierno desde 1917 cuando fue el primer rompimiento hasta ahora siempre ha sido en verano que es cuando el hielo est m s d bil
2238544 la causa ambiental contra botnia est sola y en desventaja
2238545 creo el problema es que no estamos preparados tenemos un ministerio de medio ambiente que no funciona como tal
2238546 las cuestiones ambientales no se manifiestan r pidamente en el tiempo
2238547 como fiscal act o por deber m s que por derecho por virtud de normas constitucionales y legales de mi pa s tengo la obligaci n de actuar en defensa de la causa p blica y la causa p blica est comprendida por la protecci n del medio ambiente eso tiene rango constitucional en mi pa s y por ello me obliga a actuar
2238548 las cuestiones ambientales no se manifiestan r pidamente en el tiempo son lentas se agravan por acumulaci n y por ello el da o es a largo aliento
2238549 en el uruguay tenemos un serio problema la contaminaci n por plomo en montevideo barrios humildes se han visto afectados por una contaminaci n por plomo muy severa que no es nueva arranca en 1996 y hoy todav a estamos padeciendo las consecuencias con un grave da o en una franja muy sensible como es la poblaci n infantil
2238550 inici algunas acciones a ra z de este problema y tuve xito por cuanto se logr que ancap dejara de producir nafta con plomo los otros temas todav a no se han solucionado
2238551 creo el problema es que no estamos preparados frente a las cuestiones ambientales tenemos un ministerio de medio ambiente pero yo lo he dicho que es un ministerio de papel porque no act a realmente como un ministerio de protecci n ambiental
2238552 yo he ido adquiriendo cierta prevenci n con respecto a quienes dicen que hay que convertir a la naturaleza en una especie de sujeto de derecho como forma para defenderla eso puede llevarnos a olvidar nuestras realidades cotidianas y demorar la reacci n frente a los problemas ambientales
2238553 prefiero decir que el derecho ambiental guarda una estrecha relaci n con el derecho a la vida
2238554 no me gu o tanto por la opini n de quienes siempre se opusieron a las pateras sino por la de algunos amigos fraybentinos que considero m s objetiva
2238555 fray bentos pese la importancia estrat gica que tiene por su ubicaci n geogr fica privilegiada fue una ciudad muy abandonada en el tiempo espacialmente por montevideo el nuestro es un pa s macrocef lico
2238556 sin embargo la comprobaci n que yo hago ahora es que en definitiva el emplazamiento donde est ubicada botnia la hace un mundo aparte de lo que es la propia ciudad
2238557 quiz s hecho de que el puente general san mart n no est funcionando tambi n hace que ese aislamiento aumente porque el pasar por el lugar y ver con sus propios ojos a la chimenea humeando como est es muy significativo y vale mucho m s de lo que alguien pueda decir a trav s de un micr fono o de un diario
2238558 god so loved the world he gave his only son
2238559 its deepest regret for the pain and anguish suffered by our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters their families and friends due to the adoption of resolution as thousands prepare to celebrate the 200th anniversary of slave abolition across the british empire the iamazing gracei film is preparing to launch in the uk and ireland in more than 200 screens on friday 23 march my testimony starts a bit clich like a lot of christians i know i was brought up in a christian family deblahdeblahdeblah but i have to say the fact that my parents were christians didnt beating rosacea shadow secretary of state for international development andrew mitchell mp returned last week from the thailandburma border where he accompanied christian solidarity worldwide csw to hear the testimonies of karen internally displaced people idps just inside the burma border vacations are a great time to explore new surroundings
2238560 it was on the train with its steely rhythms its rattle ty bang that is so often so stimulating to a composer i frequently hear music in the very heart of the noise and there i suddenly heard and even saw on paper the complete construction of the rhapsody from beginning to end no new themes came to me but i worked on the thematic material already in my mind and tried to conceive the composition as a whole i heard it as a sort of musical kaleidoscope of america of our vast melting pot of our unduplicated national pep of our blues our metropolitan madness by the time i reached boston i had a definite plot of the piece as distinguished from its actual substance
2238561 at least provide a stepping stone which will make it very simple for the masses to understand and therefore enjoy symphony and opera
2238562 no pasa nada con botnia no llegan los olores no hay contaminaci n
2238563 antes que traernos el ant doto preferir amos que no nos traigas el veneno
2238564 pero que quiere eso tampoco lo tiene argentina y brasil
2238565 the only problem with it is that it gives me an american accent
2238566 the world in which the events of this novel take place is a world bounded by the cold war on one side and the sexual war on the other
2238567 a girl lives in some out of the way town for nineteen years so poor she cant afford a magazine and ends up steering new york like her own private car only i wasnt steering anything not even myself
2238568 yet she identifies the extremes of her own behavior between the ideal purity represented by betsy and the image of condemned sexuality projected by doreen
2238569 she wasnt one of the fashion magazine gushers with fake eyelashes and giddy jewellery jay cee had brains so her plug ugly looks didnt seem to matter
2238570 im glad about that honey the man said and burst out laughing
2238571 he didnt really know me either he just wanted to see what a girl who was crazy enough to kill herself looked like
2238572 i thought that if my father hadnt died he would have taught me all about insects which was his speciality at university
2238573 i had always been my fathers favourite and it seemed fitting i should take on a mourning my mother had never bothered with
2238574 their mother daughter relationship was a rather problematic and ambiguous one for on the one hand they were exceptionally close to each other and on the other hand sylvia plath often claimed that she hated her mother
2238575 then sylvia held me off with her two arms straight out and she said i dont hate you you see somebody had to be the scapegoat
2238576 a time of darkness despair disillusion so black only as the inferno of the human mind ca be symbolic death and numb shock then the painful agony of slow rebirth and psychic regeneration
2238577 im vordergrund so wird gesagt stehe der schadensersatzcharakter des s hnegelds
2238578 america has never made progress on racial issues unless there was enough agitation to force society to take action
2238579 we have maintained our deals but other have not hopefully we see a good scope for our company in future demand for better quality and service is on our side and i see aviation has a great future
2238580 do not fear only believe and she will be well
2238581 the ideological becoming of a human being the process of selectively assimilating the words of others
2238582 the unspeakable stories of subjectivity meet the narratives of a culture
2238583 discourses that make available positions for subjects to take up
2238584 basically a lexicon or register of terms and metaphors drawn upon to characterize and evaluate actions and events
2238585 a range of linguistic resources that can be drawn upon and utilized in the course of everyday social interaction
2238586 so many people out there who want to do it who want to be the givers and carers
2238587 in the sense that hmm the work that i want to do for the charity thats exclusively just for the charity
2238588 i have if you like a line in the sand
2238589 i have sorted that out in my head i want to be a hero to myself
2238590 i dont give a fuck about the rest of the world really
2238591 that is that is important to me that ahh 2
2238592 i want to be able to look back at my life and say i did what i could do
2238593 it is a step in the right direction for the pilgrimage tourism boost the condition in the trains must be kept clean and tidy especially bathroom with toiletries to enjoy the comfort of travel by passengers
2238594 option of air conditioners must be kept so that those who want to comfortable journey in the cool condition must be provided at whatever extra cost the distribution reservation of such tours should be hassle free via iata approved travel companies and same should be on internet online basis and payment procedure simplified and reasonably structured for the benefit of advance bookings with some token and balance a few weeks in advance
2238595 they should not increase fares if they are doing so there give quality and better service to passengers
2238596 why are you playing your stupid game again why dont you spend some quality time with me
2238597 er because your quality time involves vegging in front of eastenders and the bill for 2 hours
2238598 games are for kids why dont you live in the real world
2238599 oh yeah the real world of celebrity fat club or dancing on ice instead of interacting with real humans and using our brains to solve challenges lets stare at a screen and watch fat whinging celebrity twats shed a few pounds by stapling their stomachs and a few repressed gay rugby stars whirl round in tights while bruce forsythe rubs his cock against jane torvilles sagging tits
2238600 yeah i should spend my day worrying about whether one armed heather mills is a slag or whether duck egg blue and brown are the best colours for tampons or wondering if eating nothing but kiwi fruit will give me ageless skin and sparkly eyes
2238601 if two of you ask it will be done for you by my father in heaven for where two or three are gathered in my name i am there among them
2238602 this is the first of its kind by any political party directly organising the fair our intention is to help students and give them proper guidance in which field he she wants to build his her career
2238603 we have come across many problems faced by the students after they complete their school they dont know what to do further and which are the area they can pursue further for better future keeping this in mind we came with an idea to organise a career fair where students can have a direct access to experts and professionals of their related fields and can clarify their doubts if any
2238604 have you not read what david did when he was hungry he and those who were with him how he entered the house of god and took and ate the bread of the presence which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat and also gave it to those with him
2238605 be for aaron and his sons and they shall eat it in a holy place

2238622 esta falta de inter s y desmotivaci n es creciente entre el alumnado a partir del final de primaria
2238623 la concienciaci n hacer comprender a los estudiantes la importancia de las matem ticas en el mundo en que vivimos la motivaci n estimular su aprendizaje y la matematizaci n recreativa ense ar con juegos de razonamiento
2238624 los adornos las ilustraciones con an cdotas episodios de la vidas privadas de los grandes matem ticos o figuras de c mic grotescas que aparecen en los libros de texto tal vez hagan interesante y hasta atractiva la clase pero por s mismas no tienen por qu servir para motivar el aprendizaje
2238625 sin embargo advierte g mez muchas veces las matem ticas recreativas o no son verdaderas matem ticas o dan una visi n equivocada de las mismas adem s de ocupar una parte del escaso tiempo escolar pueden producir un efecto rebote porque hacen creer en una fantas a que la realidad va a desmentir en cuanto haya que ponerse a trabajar en las matem ticas serias

2238752 if you are one of those people who was frightened you had a glimpse of what it feels like to be an iraqi man woman or child who experiences things like this and worse everyday
2238753 this scenario is based entirely in reality it is based on the first hand experience of mike robinson a fellow ivaw member and participant in this action i also spoke personally with many iraqi citizens during my tour who explained that raids like this one occur daily in occupied iraq
2238754 this war is a complete injustice perpetrated against the people of iraq the anti war movement must rise in solidarity with the iraqi people and their just struggle for national liberation
2238755 now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called god or that is worshipped so that as god he sitteth in the temple of god shewing himself that he is god etc

2238765 in one year i am going to make it rain and cover the whole earth with water until all is destroyed but i want you to save the righteous people and two of every kind of living thing on the earth therefore i am commanding you to build an ark
2238766 you must complete the ark and bring everything aboard in one year
2238767 i did my best but there were big problems first i had to get a permit for construction and your plans did not comply with the codes i had to hire an engineering firm and redraw the plans
2238768 then i got into a fight with osha over whether or not the ark needed a fire sprinkler system and floatation devices
2238769 then my neighbor objected claiming i was violating zoning ordinances by building the ark in my front yard so i had to get a variance from the city planning commission
2238770 i had problems getting enough wood for the ark because there was a ban on cutting trees to protect the spotted owl
2238771 they didnt take very kindly to the idea that they had no jurisdiction over the conduct of the creator of the universe
2238772 then the army corps of engineers demanded a map of the proposed new flood plan i sent them a globe
2238773 right now i am trying to resolve a complaint filed with the equal employment opportunity commission that i am practicing discrimination by not taking godless unbelieving people aboard
2238774 the irs has seized my assets claiming that im building the ark in preparation to flee the country to avoid paying taxes
2238775 finally the aclu go the courts to issue an injunction against further construction of the ark saying that since god is flooding the earth it is a religious event and therefore unconstitutional i really dont think i can finish the ark for another 5 or 6 years
2238776 you mean you are not going to destroy the earth lord

2238787 serviced apartments generally offer more space and include fully fitted kitchens and living rooms
2238788 more over daily room rates for serviced apartments are typically lower than those for hotels while serviced apartment also offer weekly and monthly rate
2238789 previously the majority of serviced apartment tenants were comprised of employees of multinational organizations on longer term assignments in bangkok
2238790 but with serviced apartments that receive hotel licenses being able to offer daily rates these properties are now becoming increasingly popular with tourists

2239072 this leads me to the definition of belief as such belief is the attitude of a person in having a proposition regarding an issue that a person takes to be true in passive understanding

2239141 god is light and in him is no darkness at all
2239142 thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil and canst not look on iniquity
2239143 power is god s hand or arm omniscience his eye mercy his bowels eternity his duration but holiness is his beauty
2239144 sing unto the lord o ye saints of his and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness
2239145 this may be said to be a transcendental attribute that as it were runs through the rest and casts luster upon them it is an attribute of attributes
2239146 the lord is righteous in all his ways and holy in all his works
2239147 thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created till iniquity was found in thee
2239148 the commandment of the lord is pure enlightening the eyes the fear of the lord is clean enduring forever the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether
2239149 the thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the lord
2239150 the lord will take vengeance on his adversaries and he reserveth wrath for his enemies
2239151 god is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints and to be had in reverence of all about him

2239166 research documents that the most important factor affecting youth hunting safety is the presence of a responsible attentive adult hunter
2239167 available data from states that have implemented families afield initiatives reveals that apprentice hunting license programs brought nearly 34 000 new hunters to the field in 2006 without a single hunting related shooting incident
2239168 the humane society misrepresents the truth when it claims that hunters have six days a week to themselves in the woods and it calls on the public to oppose sunday hunting opportunities
2239169 the groups statement gives the impression that sundays are the only days that non hunters may enter the woods during hunting season which is obviously completely false
2239170 the sporting dog defense coalition has battled a recent influx of anti sporting dog regulations and legislation from rhode island to california
2239171 the antis are subtly attacking sportsmen who hunt with dogs by advocating blurred animal cruelty laws oppressive dog care regulations and other vague bills that will do away with sporting dog activities and training programs including field trialing
2239172 california hunting dog enthusiasts must let lawmakers know that they will not be forced to give up their passions because of poorly written unjust legislation
2239173 tell state lawmakers that you oppose this overreaching bill that will outlaw the breeding of quality hunting dogs
2239174 the families afield program is proving to be safe and effective at boosting sportsmens numbers as we were confident it would
2239175 research conducted before apprentice programs were implemented showed that supervised young hunters are the safest in the field and the new data backs the claim the most important factor affecting youth hunting safety is the presence of a responsible attentive adult hunter
2239176 i recently developed an interest in hunting but without having tried it i wasnt motivated to invest my time in a hunter education course to get a hunting license
2239177 the apprentice hunting program allowed me to try deer hunting and i loved it from now on there wont be a year when i wont be in the field
2239178 its a great experience and i want to pass it on
2239179 we hope that the popularity of apprentice programs and the impressive safety statistics will help convince legislators in these states to support efforts that will make it easier for newcomers to enjoy hunting
2239180 environmental groups filed petitions with seven federal agencies epa departments of agriculture commerce defense energy interior and transportation seeking more coordinated planning and responses to global warming including an assessment of how climate change will affect thousands of the worlds species the center for biological diversity is the lead author of the petition which asks the government to factor climate change into everything from habitat designations to road building and permit approval for new energy projects in its request under the administrative procedure act 10 groups overall from maine to idaho insisted that climate change and natural habitat destruction threaten as much as one quarter of the worlds species the arizona based center for biological diversity is responsible for a much publicized bush administration decision to examine how melting sea ice has threatened the habitat of the polar bear conservation groups gave the agencies 90 days to respond and they have left open the prospect of a lawsuit in federal court if not satisfied global warming legislation introduced last month by sens bernie sanders and barbara boxer would mandate climate issues be included in all federal environmental impact statements
2239181 the ill fated inflammatory and highly inaccurate resolution 42 has been withdrawn
2239182 not only was the resolution completely unnecessary in the first place worse still it was based upon highly inaccurate information that contradicted their own firearms legislation passed when they were in power at the very least by withdrawing the resolution the party has acknowledged its mistake and taken steps to correct this procedural gaff however this does not speak to the underlying reason for the resolution and the ongoing attempt by the national liberal party to demonize legal law abiding firearms owners in canada instead of supporting the current governments efforts to target criminals who use illegal firearms to commit crimes
2239183 a new report shows 25 states performed better than the national rate in sales of hunting licenses tags and stamps in 2005 altogether national sales the main funding mechanism for state conservation agencies set a new record topping 723 million the 2005 figures just released by the u s fish and wildlife service show total sales rose 2 8 percent from the previous year while the number of customers slipped 1 4 percent from 14 7 million to 14 5 million the total number of u s hunters including both licensed and non licensed is estimated much higher than the 14 5 million acknowledged in the federal report the national sporting goods association calculates 20 6 million active hunters the outdoor industry associations latest estimate surpasses 26 million and in a new survey commissioned by the national shooting sports foundation and conducted by independent firm responsive management 19 percent of americans more than 50 million people said theyve hunted in the past two years in 2005 14 575 484 hunters purchased 35 609 605 different licenses tags and stamps at an average cost of 20 32 each total sales reached 723 712 681

2239190 these criticisms make me angry but you cant take them so seriously
2239191 polar bears live alone in the wild i see no logical reason why this bear should be killed
2239192 polar bears are under threat of extinction and if we feed the bear with a bottle it has a good chance of growing up and perhaps becoming attractive as a stud for other zoos

2239304 they should not change the sex at birth which is a factual record
2239305 if they wanted to change the gender for all the compelling reasons that theyve given it should be done perhaps with an asterisk
2239306 is based on an arbitrary distinction that says there are two and only two sexes
2239307 in reality the diversity of nature is such that there are more than just two and people who seem to belong to one of the designated sexes may really belong to the other

2239330 antara tokoh terbabit adalah si bongkok tanjung puteri yang sehingga kini sejarah perjuangannya masih tidak diketahui ramai pihak
2239331 ceritanya bermula apabila british mula menjajah singapura seterusnya cuba melebarkan pengaruh mereka ke johor
2239332 selepas si bongkok menemui ajalnya di tepi pantai itu mayatnya dijumpai seorang penduduk tempatan dikenali uteh jantan
2239333 kemudian uteh jantan bersama beberapa penduduk kampung membawa mayat si bongkok sehingga ke lereng bukit tanjung puteri dan pahlawan itu dikebumikan di situ secara rahsia
2239334 mengikut cerita penduduk tempatan nesan itu diletakkan seorang lelaki pada 23 januari 1981 selepas dia bermimpi didatangi si bongkok yang menyuruhnya menanda pusara pahlawan berkenaan
2239335 saya percaya ramai pejuang melayu yang nama mereka hilang daripada lipatan sejarah negara kita dan si bongkok adalah seorang daripada pejuang itu sejarah kita dulu ditulis british menyebabkan ramai pahlawan kita yang menentang mereka dianggap penderhaka dan nama mereka tidak dicatat dalam sejarah
2239336 saya berharap supaya sejarah ini boleh diperbetulkan semula dan pihak terbabit perlu tampil mengiktiraf perjuangan si bongkok setaraf dengan nama pejuang lain seperti tok janggut dol said dan sebagainya
2239337 saya sendiri sudah pergi ke tanjung belungkur untuk melihat sendiri pusara si bongkok tanjung puteri keadaannya amat menyedihkan kerana terbiar selepas 50 tahun kita merdeka masihkah kita sependapat dengan penjajah yang melabelkan si bongkok itu lanun dan pengganas
2239338 antara kegagalan kita dalam melaksanakan sesuatu aktiviti sebelum ini ialah kurangnya promosi khususnya di peringkat antarabangsa dan saya nampak potensi besar aktiviti memancing ini untuk menarik lebih ramai pelancong asing ke negara kita

2239340 saya tertarik apabila difahamkan ramai peserta dari negara jiran khususnya singapura menyertai pertandingan kali ini
2239341 theres a lot of work to be done before we open the place up as a tourist destination these places will attract the war veterans historians university students and families of those who were posted in malaya during the war
2239342 malaysians too will want to look at some of the war relics left behind by the british
2239343 the british had built the battery prior to world war ii as a defence against the japanese which they believed would come from the south singapore
2239344 however the battery was never really used as the japanese came in from the north through thailand instead
2239345 this historical site has always been here but many people dont know about it it would be good if we can use it to educate people on the historical value of this place but first theres a lot of cleaning up to do
2239346 there are kelongs offshore houses here which i am sure not many urban people are familiar with it is a great opportunity for urbanites to get close to nature

2239350 as part of the criteria for entering the bctc process
2239351 a first nation must submit a map of what they consider to be their traditional territory that is the subject of negotiations
2239352 the amount of land to be transferred to a particular first nation will depend on factors specific to the first nation and the negotiations there is no percentage of land set aside for the entire province that will be available as treaty settlement land
2239353 would be equivalent to private property federal and provincial laws would apply on treaty settlement lands with first nations laws operating simultaneously

2239379 all the happiness there is in the world comes from thinking about others and all the suffering comes from preoccupation with yourself

2239410 for no human being will be justified in his gods sight by deeds prescribed by the law for through he law comes the knowledge of sin
2239411 what good is it my brothers and sisters if you say you have faith but do not have works can faith save you if a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food and one of you says to them go in peace keep warm and eat your fill and yet you do not supply their bodily needs what is the good of that so faith by itself if it has no works is dead
2239412 the present joint declaration has this intention namely to show that on the basis of their dialogue the subscribing lutheran churches and the roman catholic church are now able to articulate a common understanding of our justification by gods grace through faith in christ
2239413 this joint declaration rests on the conviction that in overcoming the earlier controversial questions and doctrinal condemnations the church neither takes the condemnations lightly nor do they disavow their own past on the contrary this declaration is shaped by the conviction that in their respective histories our churches have come to new insights
2239414 the foundation and presupposition of justification is the incarnation death and resurrection of christ together we confess by grace alone in faith in christs saving work and not because of any merit on our part we are accepted by god and receive the holy spirit who renews our hearts while equipping and calling us to good works
2239415 in the lutheran doctrine of justification by faith alone a distinction but not a separation emphasis added is made between justification itself and the renewal of ones way of life that necessarily follows from justification and without which faith does not exist
2239416 we confess together that in baptism the holy spirit unites one with christ justifies and truly renews the person but the justified must all through life constantly look to gods unconditional justifying grace
2239417 men are not flattered by being shown that there has been a difference of purpose between the almighty and them
2239418 an important spiritual law is here involved i have explained that you can weaken his prayers by diverting his attention from the enemy himself to his own states of mind about the enemy on the other hand fear becomes easier to master when the patients mind is diverted from the thing feared to the fear itself
2239419 was recommended to me by a friend in a catholic forum i cant remember how this book helped her but it was definitely worth buying so when i saw the book at the daughters of st pauls booth at st mary of the angels last year i hastily bought it afraid that i might forget about the book

2239515 reliance and other corporates like metro cash should stay away from agri marketing in the state i object to the food processing and land and land reforms departments for trying to allow reliance entry into agri marketing calling their centers food processing units is mere eyewash the food processing and horticulture department does not have jurisdiction to give reliance permission

2239519 we will write a letter to the state government to have at least 10 per cent of the total agricultural produce sold through public retail units

2239554 social scientific research has largely confirmed the thesis that affect attitudes beliefs and behaviour can indeed spread through populations as if they were somehow infectious simple exposure sometimes appears to be a sufficient condition for social transmission to occur this is the social contagion thesis that sociocultural phenomena can spread through and leap between populations more like outbreaks of measels or chicken pox than through a process of rational choice

2239627 that denying rights and benefits to committed same sex couples that are statutorily given to their heterosexual counterparts violates the equal protection guarantee
2239628 that a separate statutory scheme which uses a title other than marriage contravenes equal protection principles so long as the rights and benefits of civil marriage are made equally available to same sex couples the name to be given to the statutory scheme that provides full rights and benefits to same sex couples whether marriage or some other term is a matter left to the democratic process
2239629 that are deeply rooted in the traditions history and conscience of the people
2239630 loving teaches that the fundamental right to marry no more can be limited to same race couples than it can be limited to those who choose a committed relationship with persons of the opposite sex by imposing that limitation on same sex couples the majority denies them access to one of our most cherished institutions simply because they are homosexuals
2239631 first the legislature could rationally decide that for the welfare of children it is more important to promote stability and to avoid instability in opposite sex than in same sex relationships heterosexual intercourse has a natural tendency to lead to the birth of children homosexual intercourse does not
2239632 the legislature could rationally believe that it is better other things being equal for children to grow up with both a mother and a father

2239653 we dont have plans to call congress into session it wont make a difference if democratic leaders are unwilling to bring up a bill for an up down vote
2239654 we know congressional democrats wont pass all of the appropriations bills theyve already demonstrated their failure with that but when they return theyll have a month to at least address the top priorities funding our troops by passing the dod department of defense appropriations bill and the bringing to the floor of the interior appropriations bill to allow for votes on oil shale and exploration of the outer continental shelf

2239663 protection without patents how firms in china earn rents from innovation by factual protection
2239664 these are great opportunities and the liberal party wants to use them we want to advocate collecting use improvement and spreading of all culture ideas and innovation for non commercial use
2239665 international law regulates most of these questions i have yet to conclude on everything regarding these complex problems but i have faith in this as a radical and modern solution that still ensures artists rights to revenue and attribution
2239666 protection without patents how firms in china earn rents from innovation by factual protection
2239667 in this contribution we analyse how the managers of foreign firms in china craft strategies to protect their intellectual property rights ipr we show that a modernist perspective would predict ipr protection by patents and we show why chinas formal legal system is not capa ble to provide effective ipr protection this contradiction leads to our assumption that managers have crafted factual strategies to protect their ipr without using the formal legal system from our analysis of 13 in depth case studies we find that managers have indeed crafted such factual strategies by their interaction with the societal context of china
2239668 youd rather see digg go down fighting than bow down to a bigger company
2239669 we hear you and effective immediately we wont delete stories or comments containing the code and will deal with whatever the consequences might be
2239670 our goal is always to maintain a purely democratic system for the submission and sharing of information and we want digg to continue to be a great resource for finding the best content
2239671 however in order for that to happen we all need to work together to protect digg from exposure to lawsuits that could very quickly shut us down
2239672 we had to make a call and in our desire to avoid a scenario where digg would be interrupted or shut down we decided to comply and remove the stories with the code

2239676 t he quality of issued software patents will rise but there will be far fewer of them
2239677 ksr will make it easier for challengers to prove software patents are invalid for being obvious but just because the task is easier doesnt necessarily mean more people will take up the task its still expensive and timely to challenge a software patent so people need to have the right incentives to do so
2239678 not so optimistic that we will see a slowdown in softwarepatent applications or any improvement in the quality of issued software patents
2239679 while ksr is a good decision i dont think it will improve the software patent problem in the u s without further reform

2239745 after those states florida and michigan held their primaries in violation of democratic party rules the party cracked down on them and said their delegates would not have a voice at the national convention in denver then in may the rules committee agreed to let their delegates have half a vote each
2239746 senator barack obama the partys presumptive nominee has asked the credentials committee to let the two states have full voting rights at the convention after all
2239747 the request is likely to be granted since it comes from the all but certain nominee who now controls the party apparatus
2239748 the move was not unexpected no nominee could afford to alienate the delegates and voters from two such important states
2239749 moreover mr obama had essentially promised the two states that he would seek to restore their full voting strength as we
2239750 why would their voting strength matter when it is clear who the nominee will be
2239751 because as senator carl levin democrat of michigan said at the time party conventions do more than pick a nominee they also begin to establish the framework for the primary calendar in the next presidential election
2239752 at the same time mr obamas request to restore full voting strength to florida and michigan is likely to cause heartburn for party officials who have struggled to maintain some authority over the primary calendar
2239753 by granting mr obamas request the party will essentially be giving a green light to other states to ignore the calendar next time because there will be no consequences
2239754 the credentials committee is to meet aug 24 the day before the convention begins in denver to determine who will be seated
2239755 in a letter today to committee officials mr obama asked that a resolution be passed to entitle each delegate from florida and michigan to cast a full vote
2239756 the party must be united in the fall he said adding to that end democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
