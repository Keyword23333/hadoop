200001 the v10 pocket projector has achieved significant interest amongst some of australias largest retailers and we are discussing commercial arrangements with retailers now we expect sales of the pocket projector to be high particularly as we approach the christmas period there is nothing like the pocket projector on the market today it is a true hybrid product that can be used for both business and leisure given the success of devices such as the iphone we expect the projector will fit well into this market
200002 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
200003 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did

200007 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
200008 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most

200011 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
200012 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
200013 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
200014 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

200019 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists synthetic molecules that mimic the action of natural molecules are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of radiation therapy
200020 turning cb1 back on and than treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention

200045 to be honest i dont think to this day i will ever in my life do an interview with her
200046 it really affected me and solheim wasnt a time to talk about it
200047 the way laura has chosen to handle the situation publicly is really disappointing
200048 i hope her heart will at some point recognize the comment was not personal highly emotional and certainly never meant to be heard over the air i have made myself available to her but she has chosen not to talk scream at me or whatever else she feels she needs to do for her peace of mind
200049 and i dont even see her as a friend anymore
200050 you know sherri and i we thought it was ridiculous really
200051 but it was a heart thing more than anything else

200055 forgiveness is the fragrance that the violet sheds on the heel that has crushed it
200056 it is a sign of spiritual maturity when the individual experiences for him or herself a powerful urgency to evolve as you begin to transcend the ego and awaken to the authentic self which is the first cause or creative impulse becoming conscious of itself in the human heart and mind you will have the often shocking recognition that there is literally no time to waste not because some external authority has told you so but because the internal god principle awakening within you makes it apparent as an intuitive recognition or absolute knowing in that recognition you become aware of the absolute dimension of life and death and you realize the precariousness of your presence on this planet as a vulnerable biological organism supported by a delicate balance of countless factors so a sign of maturity in a spiritual context is knowing how precious every moment actually is on one hand because of your human frailty and on the other hand because you appreciate the miraculous nature of the self reflective capacity that has taken billions of years to emerge in this evolving organism and recognize its profound implications for our particular moment in history you begin to see that the extraordinary human form that is you makes all things possible and at the same time you become painfully aware of its inherent limitations this dual recognition creates a sense of urgency purpose and meaning that is overwhelming and the degree to which you awaken to this is the degree to which you will feel compelled to drop your identification with the endless fears and desires of the ego why because there is no time to waste in light of the overwhelming significance and precariousness of our presence here the egos concerns become irrelevant you will find the willingness to nobly struggle in whatever way is needed so your own ego will never be an obstacle to the evolution of consciousness itself indeed if you are authentically engaged with the evolution of consciousness there is literally no difference between your own effort and intention to participate in the process and the actual development of that process itself what could be more exciting than that then gods thrill becomes your thrill and the ecstatic urgency of the evolutionary impulse becomes your very own reason to be
200057 as one matures in spiritual life one becomes more comfortable with paradox more appreciative of lifes ambiguities its many levels and inherent conflicts one develops a sense of lifes irony metaphor and humor and a capacity to embrace the whole with its beauty and outrageousness in the graciousness of the heart
200058 if you let go a little youll have a little peace if you let go a lot youll have a lot of peace if you let go completely youll have complete peace

200070 i love that people are coming here and experiencing good things about this neighborhood
200071 there were times back in the early 90s that it was pretty rough people were scared to come into the neighborhood but we have so much to offer here we are a unique community and the art fair helps people see that i think
200072 usually when i go to a show in another city i sleep in the back of my van to keep expenses down and now in the winter months i will try to pick up snow shoveling jobs or other things here and there to make ends meet

200096 el a o pasado tomamos la peor escuela de chile
200097 que obtuvo el m s bajo puntaje simce en lenguaje 152 y matem tica 128 de 4 b sico
200098 si escuchaste bien 128 pr cticamente la mitad de lo que sacar a una escuela mediocre
200099 piensa tu que es una escuela rural de 100 estudiantes mapuches altamente vulnerables y baja autoestima la recibimos en agosto del 2007 en un estado pedag gico an mico y de infraestructura deplorables m s de la mitad de la escuela de 1 a 8 b sico era analfabeta y con graves d ficit en matem tica
200100 es una verg enza que chile tenga decenas de estas escuelas para educar perd n para alimentar no m s a miles de ni os pobres se corrige pues la junaeb s funciona es una situaci n de impunidad total y un caldo de cultivo para la amargura la desesperanza y m s pobreza
200101 nosotros decimos aplicar la receta b sica de las escuelas eficaces cambi la directora y priorizamos animar a los profesores y ni os con los ni os hicimos talleres de todo tipo tic arte malabarismo rob tica deportes m sica etc los hicimos trabajar harto y sentir el gusto por el logro y por aprender adem s tuvieron un intenso reforzamiento en lectura y matem tica
200102 con los profesores trabajamos en talleres de c mo ense ar a leer y c mo ense ar matem tica y trabajamos mucho para elevar sus expectativas en los ni os y sentirse eficaces
200103 empresario que se enamor de dar quien hizo pintar toda la escuela tap goteras ilumin y puso calefacci n con le a en todas las salas priv al patio del hist rico barro compr libros nuevos computadores dio agua a los ba os lo que implic que un cami n de su empresa vaya a dejar agua d a por medio ni os sin piojos y un largo etc tera hoy es otra escuela los recreos est n llenos de risas
200104 el empresario les dijo un d a a todos los ni os frente a los profesores y sus padres yo soy empresario hagamos un negocio yo les ayudo a tener una escuela de excelencia si ustedes me pagan con esfuerzo y con aprendizajes por la flauta funcion el negocio bueno tambi n sirvi que rez ramos para que saliera del ltimo lugar
200105 el resultado es que la escuela subi 50 puntos en lenguaje y 57 en matem tica estuvo entre las 50 que m s subieron en el pa s
200106 ya es casi normal nos falta subir otros 50 puntos y llegamos
200107 es que es posible normalizar una escuela muy pobre en poco tiempo con poca plata y con una buena actitud de la comunidad dej ndola en un piso de dignidad m nima se puede se puede
200108 o valentim loureiro quando estava em gondomar foi criticado por ter dado electrodom sticos s pessoas com isto j ningu m diz nada
200109 os electrodom sticos s o mais caros do que as l mpadas
200110 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
200111 what is missing and is urgently required in islamabad is a coherent policy
200112 the world and all of pakistan is looking to islamabad for leadership and vision the time to act is running out very quickly
200113 some extremists are coming out of parts of pakistan into afghanistan
200114 thats troubling to us troubling to afghanistan and it should be troubling to pakistan
200115 actionable intelligence against high value al qaeda targets and the pakistani government was unwilling to go after those targets
200116 they have tunnel vision they see more foreign fighters pouring in more training more cross border attacks
200117 we are fighting a war here but the army is geared to peacetime
200118 they view taliban violence as a reaction to the use of force against them by pakistan and the u s rather than a strategy to establish their hegemony in the name of islam
200119 no guarantee that such an action would eliminate militancy in the area
200120 rather it may worsen the situation and increase american losses
200121 the u s military would find pakistans tribal areas extremely tough going
200122 the primary challenge would come not from the militants or terrorists but from the rest of pakistans 165 million people and army
200123 what ive said is that if we had actionable intelligence against high value al qaeda targets and the pakistani government was unwilling to go after those targets then we should
200124 now my hope is that it doesnt come to that pakistani government would recognize that if we had osama bin laden in our sights that we should fire or capture
200125 pervez musharraf and his government has committed crimes for which there are no examples in the entire world
200126 arrested arab mujahedeen and handed them over to infidel americans
200127 this is such an ugly spot on pakistans history which cannot be forgotten until doomsday
200128 but when infidels insulted the prophet peace be upon him he could not tolerate to live further with humiliation and said death is dearer to me in the way of god
200129 we feel that the effort on the other side is somewhat lacking
200130 we cannot do it alone the government of afghanistan has to be equally supportive
200131 it deeply hurts us when there are accusatory statements from afghanistan that we are endangering their security
200132 this menace of terrorism is our concern as much as it is yours we are concerned and very serious in dealing with this extremist terrorist element
200133 what we need to do is look hard at how the taliban is regrouping why the taliban is fighting in the way they are now
200134 they generally are taken on and defeated pretty handily when they come in actual military formations
200135 but certainly theres an uptick in the terrorism not just against forces but against the afghan people
200136 and in that regard everybody needs to do more but pakistan does need to do more
200137 we understand that its difficult we understand the north west frontier area is difficult but militants cannot be allowed to organise there and to plan there and to engage across the borders
200138 we are very concerned about the afghanistan pakistan border area and we dont believe that can be regarded as a bilateral matter between pakistan and afghanistan
200139 this is an area where both the regional community and the international community needs to do more we do need to engage pakistan more in a dialogue
200140 taking the fight to al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan
200141 we need more troops more helicopters more satellites more predator drones in the afghan border region and we must make it clear that if pakistan cannot or will not act we will take out high level terrorist targets like osama bin laden if we have them in our sights
200142 when i am commander in chief there will be nowhere the terrorists can run and nowhere they can hide
200143 senator obama will tell you we cant win in afghanistan without losing in iraq in fact he has it exactly backwards it is precisely the success of the surge in iraq that shows us the way to succeed in afghanistan
200144 the iraqi government believes the end of 2010 is the appropriate time for the withdrawal
200145 this whole notion that i would initiate a precipitous withdrawal just isnt borne out by anything ive said what i have repeatedly said is that we should be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in
200146 if on the other hand youve got a deteriorating situation for some reason then thats going to have to be taken into account
200147 has brought a level of realism and professionalism and planning to the job that is worthy of praise
200148 the north west frontier province is breaking away from pakistan that is what is happening that is the reality
200149 president pervez musharrafs eight year policy to deal with the issue through the barrel of a gun and the alliance with america
200150 we understand that its difficult we understand that the north west frontier area is difficult but militants cannot be allowed to organise there and to plan there and to engage across the border
200151 the morale of our fighters in afghanistan is very high and they are putting up a tough fight against us troops
200152 the bad guys are even popping up and giving television interviews thats a reflection of whats happening
200153 that is driving a dangerous wedge between them and the afghan people
200154 the result is weakening public support for nation building even though few actively support the taliban
200155 the taliban is not going to be defeated militarily and is impervious to outside criticism
200156 if washington committed the folly of invading pakistan the entire nation will fight against them and every citizen will turn into a freedom fighter
200157 prices are deliberately increased by unjustified raise in petrol power gas and edibles rates to force people to starve and be without basic necessities
200158 theyd be unwelcome not just by the government but by the people it would be unproductive we are of the view that our troops are capable of dealing with the situation but we have to focus on the unwanted element that want to slip in
200159 we have floated some ideas with the afghan government but we feel an equal response should come from the other side of the border
200160 we would like to see allied troops manning the border effectively but on the other side in afghanistan
200161 the murder killing destruction dishonouring and insecurity in afghanistan is carried out by the intelligence administration of pakistan
200162 when hamid karzai makes that statement he should also look at the construction efforts pakistan has made in afghanistan
200163 i think knee jerk reactions and such statements do not enable an environment of co operation
200164 the sort of widespread fear and panic that was seen in bangalore after the blasts is just what they want to see and what the jihadists have been aiming at
200165 its exactly the sort of very potent message they want to send out that the hub of our global it and outsourcing industry is under attack and unsafe
200166 together with the attacks inahmedabad and the mayhem that was caused there this represents a huge crisis for the government time and again it is showing itself completely impotent in dealing with terrorism
200167 the latest terrorist acts have again highlighted the need for a firm and effective anti terrorist legal framework
200168 the land of mahatma gandhi who came from gujarat has been bloodied by terrorists whom we shall not spare
200169 in the light of the injustice and wrongs on the muslims of gujarat we advance our jihad and call all our brethren under it to unite and answer those irresolute kafireen infidels of india
200170 confirmedhow deeply embedded the local fundamentalist outfit is in the state
200171 no question that some extremists are coming out of parts of pakistan into afghanistan
200172 thats troubling to us troubling to afghanistan and it should be troubling to pakistan
200173 we must make it clear that if pakistan cannot or will not act we will take out high level terrorist targets if we have them in our sights
200174 the taliban is moving forward in a very calculated way
200175 it has no intention of fighting a u s proxy war in the tribal territories
200176 it also knows that the u s will continue to pay it large subsidies to ensure the safeguarding of he u s supply lines to afghanistan and the countrys nuclear weapons
200177 also reemphasized that pakistan armed forces are capable of handling any challenges to our security
200178 it was a very pointed message saying look we know theres a connection not just with haqqani but also with other bad guys and isi and we think you could do more and we want you to do more about it
200179 the chairman desires to keep these meetings private and therefore it would be inappropriate to discuss any details
200180 genuine and longstanding concerns about pakistans ties to the haqqani network which of course has links to al qaeda
200181 we reject this report this is unfounded baseless and malicious
200182 i would like to emphasise here that isi is a premier intelligence agency which has caught or apprehended maximum al qaeda operatives including those who were linked with criminals and responsible for attacking the us mainland on september 11 2001
200183 it was a very pointed message saying look we know theres a connection not just with haqqani but also with the other bad guys and isi and we think you could do more and we want you to do more about it
200184 it was a very pointed message saying look we know theres a connection not just with haqqani but also with other bad guys and isi and we think you could do more and we want you to do more about it
200185 the chairman desires to keep these meetings private and therefore it would be inappropriate to discuss any details
200186 genuine and longstanding concerns about pakistans ties to the haqqani network which of course has links to al qaeda
200187 the presence of foreign fighters is increasing and increasingly the operations of the terrorists are led by foreigners
200188 there is also evidence that the activities increased by some 40 percent since tribal areas became unregulated following the negotiations between the pakistan government and baitullah mehsud
200189 but the isaf mandate is very clear and that goes as far as the border
200190 in terms of fighting the cause that is for the international community to put pressure on those who can do something about it
200191 in the past the attacks were mostly on afghan and foreign forces now we see they target vital and basic infrastructure
200192 all personnel manning the post were taken hostage and shifted to some unknown location
200193 i would like to emphasise here that isi is a premier intelligence agency which has caught or apprehended maximum al qaeda operatives including those who were linked with criminals and responsible for attacking the us mainland on september 11 2001 we reject this report this is unfounded baseless and malicious
200194 the burning issue of course is as to who controls the isi
200195 in their the americans view there are some people at some level in the isi who tip off the taleban at some level about impending missile attacks when these are shared with the pakistanis
200196 india wants to destabilise fata federally administered tribal areas what india and afghan president hamid karzai are doing must stop they must stop this
200197 the time has come for us to reveal the facts and tell the world how outside forces are creating troubles in pakistan
200198 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
200199 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
200200 and asked about leaked information that tipped militants to surveillance efforts by western intelligence services
200201 this is a baseless allegation that the new york times keeps on recycling using anonymous sources these stories always die afterwards because there is no proof
200202 this is a national institution which is vital for security the isis role in fighting terrorism and extremism is exceptional
200203 the indians are absolutely convinced its true and theyre right
200204 the clearest evidence to date that pakistani intelligence officers are actively undermining american efforts to combat militants in the region
200205 we need to know whose side the army and the isi really are on
200206 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof

200213 el dr yoshida ha trasportado su estudio de la formaci n de estrellas primordiales a un nuevo nivel con esta simulaci n pero solo no lleva a un punto intermedio hacia nuestra meta final es como poner los cimientos de un rascacielos
200214 debemos seguir nuestros estudios en este rea para comprender como creci la inicialmente diminuta protoestrella capa tras capa hasta finalmente formar una estrella masiva
200215 nuestro equipo cient fico est totalmente convencido de que se trata de agua
200216 ya hemos visto evidencias de este agua congelada antes en observaciones de la sonda espacial mars odyssey y en trozos desvanecidos observados por el phoenix el mes pasado pero sta es la primera vez que se toca y se prueba la existencia de agua en marte

200219 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
200220 i regret that you bought into the bullshit of the blagojevich people
200221 why should we make a judgement now thats gonna be different than september october or november
200222 so whats my pain in the butt brother up to this morning
200223 hes already selling coffee cakes actually theyre jumbo muffins but hes calling them cupcakes
200224 really good hell be out of business soon and in jail where he belongs
200225 how long you think its gonna take for somebody to realize that his cupcakes taste just like gingers coffee cakes
200226 yes and i helped him we started with the sweet ginger cake he wanted to try just one recipe at first to see how it goes over and we followed the recipe very carefully i dont know what went wrong
200227 maybe you baked them too long or at the wrong temperature
200228 well if they dont taste right then why is he trying to sell them thats crazy
200229 because cash cant tell the difference he thinks theyre fine he has no sense of taste
200230 i could probably take a break at around 3 30
200231 well this afternoon when i come back ill work hard for you
200232 yeah but youll only stay ten minutes he gets you all night long
200233 no not really but its the only way i knew to keep up with what hes doing cash is determined to steal all my customers
200234 oh come on now bull hes nowhere close to doing that
200235 and i just dont know what to do about it i tossed and turned all night trying to think of who else might have wanted to kill navy
200236 maybe its some other ex girlfriend could be somebody from dallas who knows what all he was into over there maybe he owed money to a loan shark
200237 youre right it could be somebody from out of town all im thinking about is the people here in coreyville
200238 you cant always go by looks think about judas the other eleven didnt think he looked like a traitor
200239 youre not helping judas committed suicide i love that girl i cant stand the thought of her being hurt
200240 no i will not accept it she is not the one
200241 well maybe chief foenapper has some new leads he might already have another suspect or two
200242 but if he did wouldnt he have let me know about it
200243 honestly i doubt it my impression is that he wants to solve this crime all by himself i remember how tight lipped he was out at the nursing home he didnt want to tell us anything
200244 i was picking up some donuts for henry over at cashs place and i saw that hes started selling muffins and i thought id try one i love your coffee cakes ginger but i was in a hurry and i thought i could save some time
200245 i understand its okay phyllis it doesnt hurt my feelings
200246 so even though henrys waiting for his donuts and hes got to get to work i just had to get me a sweet ginger cake
200247 phyllis i know youre in a hurry but could i ask you a question
200248 you said you didnt like the muffin you got at cashs did you eat it all or do you still have some of it left
200249 i was going to eat it on my way home but it just wasnt very good so i only ate a couple of bites its in the car
200250 ill make you a deal if youll let me have whatevers left of it ill buy your coffee cake this morning
200251 ill bag it up while you run out to your car what do you say
200252 wonder if its supposed to taste like your sweet ginger cake
200253 why is he calling it a cupcake its too big to be a cupcake
200254 but i dont get it couldnt he tell that it didnt taste right
200255 no he had to care otherwise why pay for the recipe
200256 i wish i had never started the whole fake recipe book thing it may be the very reason navys dead
200257 no ginger if he stole it and then somebody killed him for it thats not your fault that boy was a good for nothing anyway i cant say im all that sorry to see him go
200258 addie how can you say that he didnt deserve to die
200259 im sorry mrs lightley i hate to bother you so late
200260 dont be silly lacey come on in here and get out of the cold
200261 you should be it was obvious that you were lying
200262 so you knew i was afraid of that i guess the chief could tell too
200263 no and he didnt tell me what he was thinking either i didnt say anything because i dont believe for one second that youre capable of killing somebody even navy i mean i know you had strong feelings for him sometimes i wasnt sure whether you loved him or hated him but clearly you werent over him
200264 honey its written all over your face youre so easy to read
200265 i overheard you talking to a young woman in the bakery one day you were on a break and the two of you were looking through a catalog you thought they were sexy and your friend was encouraging you to buy them
200266 i cant believe you heard us but anybody with that catalog could have bought those panties
200267 i know it was just a theory until i saw the look on your face tonight when the chief mentioned them that gave it away
200268 how do you know i havent told you what im thinking
200269 youre thinking i had sex with navy in his car
200270 well lets not worry so much about what i think the important thing is what the police think
200271 let me play devils advocate for a minute you could have seduced navy into having sex with you and then left the panties under his car seat hoping kayla would find them then perhaps she would confront him theyd fight over it and she would leave him then he would come back to you
200272 okay what you said is half right i did put the panties in his car
200273 this morning while navy was in the kitchen picking up the three day olds i went out for a smoke
200274 addie mentioned that she was upset that you took a break when she had asked you to check out front to see if there were any more cakes that needed to go
200275 yeah i felt bad about that but i couldnt stand it any longer i had to do it today navy always kept his car locked at night and he had a car alarm but he never locked it when he made a quick stop for example at a convenience store so i knew it would be unlocked
200276 you put them under his car seat to make kayla jealous
200277 well that makes you look kinda desperate but it doesnt make you look like a killer so you need to go tell the police your story
200278 please tell me you didnt take it out of his car
200279 i didnt i promise but the police are not going to believe me
200280 why not theyll check for fingerprints and theyll find yours on the door and maybe on the seat but not on the glove box right
200281 thats the problem i did touch the glove box my fingerprints might even be on the inside of it
200282 oh no honey you opened it why did you do that
200283 because i had planned to put the panties in there then i realized that navy might find them before kayla did but i knew that he never looks under the seats when we were together i always cleaned out the car for him he didnt the trust the car wash bozos he preferred doing it himself at least the outside cleaning the interior was womans work he used to say so i figured kayla would be cleaning out the car one day and find them under the seat
200284 and hopefully think the panties were mine since they had the words unlace me on them
200285 the thing with the panties is bad enough but you knew which coffee cake was navys favorite and you could have injected fish oil into the cake early this morning when you first got to work when addie went out to check to see if there were any other three day old cakes she found one or two i wonder if either of them was a sweet ginger cake
200286 i know but think about how it looks you knew the cake would seem extra moist but it wouldnt taste funny because purified fish oil doesnt have a smell or taste and if anyone else ate the cake they wouldnt be harmed it would only hurt navy because of his allergy
200287 and the only other thing you had to do was remove the epi pen from his glove box and that glove box door has your fingerprints on it
200288 are you going to tell the police about all this
200289 but i hope you know that we may both end up in jail
200290 oh no i dont want you to go to jail for me maybe i should go turn myself in right now
200291 no im sorry honey i shouldnt have said that i was just kidding ill protect myself if they put me under oath ill tell the truth in the meantime ill try to be legally evasive
200292 so just go home and try to get some rest and enjoy your day off tomorrow
200293 theres one other thing i think it may have been a mistake to put my grandmothers house up for sale
200294 really well maybe you should quit referring to it as your grandmothers house she left it to you because she wanted you to have it its your house and you can do whatever you want with it
200295 i know but you were nice enough to set me up with your realtor friend so i hate to back out shes already spent a couple of weeks trying to sell it
200296 dont worry about that lacey just give her a call shell understand
200297 okay ill call her i thought i wouldnt be able to handle it that id see my grandmother in every room id just start crying all over again but now i want to see her there i want to remember the good times we had in that house
200298 well its kinda bad but its not what it looks like
200299 no no of course not its not even my gun its dannys
200300 yes i dont know where or why he got it but i dont want it in my apartment what can i do with it i cant just throw it in the trash and i sure dont want to turn it in to the police
200301 ill figure out something but you cant tell anybody you gave it to me
200302 ye have heard that it was said of them of old time thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment
200303 but i say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment
200304 we cant always be at the front of the line
200305 i got the distinct impression that the good reverend was just itching to invite our ginger over for a nice cozy lunch didnt yall notice
200306 i didnt notice but i have seen the way he looks at her
200307 i didnt mean for it to sound crude i just think he really likes you and yeah i think hed like to ask you out
200308 just to wake ginger up and get her back into the game
200309 maybe i dont want to be in the game right now
200310 but im not stopping the rest of you go for it
200311 theres no coach in fact in my case theres no game
200312 i mean what are we doing for lunch were just sitting here
200313 but i dont want to see any crumbs in my cars
200314 now ginger can give us the rest of the details about last night
200315 come on you know you cant keep a secret from us
200316 i told you that somebody put fish oil in the coffee cake obviously they knew about navys allergy and they knew he kept his epi pen in his glove box
200317 women can be a heck of a lot meaner than men if you really tick em off
200318 but like i said theres no way she did it
200319 but the other day i was walking out of wal mart and i saw lacey standing in the parking lot yelling at some guy in a black car i couldnt see who he was
200320 could have been and then the guy just peeled out and drove away leaving her standing there
200321 and since they broke up they havent been on very good terms but shes no killer im sure of that

200351 you dont know my husband that does not deserve any respect
200352 well ephesians 5 33 commands husbands to love their wives so i assume from that there must be something within the nature of a woman that needs to feel love for who she is and because women are commanded to respect there must be something within the heart of the man that needs that and as weve said that when a woman feels unloved unfortunately she reacts in ways that feel disrespectful when a husband feels disrespected he reacts in ways that are unloving

200362 democrats will head into the august recess friday with the shadow of gas prices hanging over them following a mix up about whether house speaker nancy pelosi d calif had hinted that she might allow a vote on new oil drilling
200363 she appeared to crack open the door to considering drilling in new areas during a thursday afternoon roundtable with reporters but her staff quickly snuffed such talk
200364 hell otherwise known as congress has officially frozen over for the first time since the 1950s members will skip town today for the august recess without either chamber having passed a single appropriations bill then again democrats appear ready to sacrifice their whole agenda even spending rather than allow new domestic energy production
200365 since you changed the new system over its full of crap
200366 you never get to talk to the same person twice
200367 the new system is not working right it is a fake and a fraud
200368 our june 23 letter states that fns expects fssa to realize substantial improvements in the area of application processing before the state proceeds with any additional roll out of the modernization project this was not an order to stop rolling out rather a statement that we trusted indianas commitment to successful implementation would lead the state to this same conclusion fns does not have the authority to order the state to stop the project as your statement notes fns has authority to suspend disallow administrative costs under 7cfr276 4 this authority is directed at violations of the act and regulations we did not invoke this authority in our june 23 communication
200369 this shocking news is just the latest installment in this administrations failure of leadership the governors rush to make a profit and privatize indianas services has once again caused harm to indianas most vulnerable citizens in a time of record high unemployment health care costs home foreclosures and personal bankruptcies this further demonstrates how out of touch this governor is to the needs and concerns of the hoosiers he has left behind as i have traveled indiana over the recent months i have heard from many people about the problems they have encountered with this system the governor and his administration have heard these same concerns yet apparently did not care enough to act the fact that it took the federal government to come in and shut down this program is further evidence of how this governors has disregarded his responsibilities it is an embarrassment and the people of indiana deserve better
200370 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
200371 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
200372 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
200373 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
200374 i think without getting into the politics of the campaign and the assertions made by candidates about this the fact is that the military commanders have been telling all of us for some time that our armed forces are stretched that the requirements in afghanistan or anywhere else for that matter are hard to meet that as a matter of fact we really need some repair of our equipment and our supplies to support the troops
200375 it just seems like typical government that we were misled with what it would cost what it provided and how soon it would be here

200391 we are surprised and disappointed with this action especially given that sugammadex received a unanimous recommendation for approval by the fda advisory committee on anesthetics and life support in march of this year
200392 i am profoundly disappointed because i thought this drug would dramatically improve patient care and safety
200393 as an anesthesiologist for over 30 years i thought the allergic reactions if due to sugammadex were very mild and not as serious as drugs we currently use including neostigmine and succinylcholine
200394 it looks like the fda is in a bunker down mode with congress all over them
200395 and because sugammadex can completely reverse a profound paralysis it would have allowed more ideal surgical procedures

200404 mr george now has the right to be regarded as an innocent man but that does not mean it was wrong to bring the case
200405 our test is always whether there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction it would be wholly wrong to only bring cases where we were guaranteed a conviction
200406 it is impossible to know what weight if any the jury attached to the fdr evidence
200407 just as likely that the single particle of fdr came from some extraneous source as it was that it came from a gun fired by the appellant
200408 witnesses and other witnesses from the forensic science service told the court of appeal that this was not the right conclusion to draw from the discovery of the particle of fdr
200409 it was in fact no more likely that the particle had come from a gun fired by barry george than that it had come from some other source

200416 i would like to commend the rcmp for their intensive investigation that has successfully culminated in the charges being laid and the entering of guilty pleas under the excise act illicit cigarette sales undermine our economy and have a significant impact on the safety of our communities and our economy tobacco trafficking supports organized crime which in turn funds other crimes like drug and gun smuggling this is why the government worked diligently with the rcmp to introduce a contraband tobacco enforcement strategy these measures to combat the growing contraband tobacco market help front line police officers in their effort to stem and seize the flow of illicit tobacco related products this government is determined to tackle crime whether it be a single individual or a large corporation

200438 i think theres really time for people that are sharing those frustrations to become a little more vocal put a little more pressure on congress and certainly the next president to fix this problem
200439 this is the first time in many many years that ive been undecided this late in the game

200450 i am not the least bit shy of bringing up the concerns expressed by this factory worker and i believe that ill have an opportunity to do so with the president and at the same time enjoy a great sporting event
200451 there is no greater spokesman for human rights in the world than our president
200452 the sudanese governments recent attacks take us back to the very darkest days of the conflict
200453 the security council shouldnt stand by as though this is
200454 the councils inaction has given sudan a green light to continue attacking civilian targets flouting international law and security council resolutions
200455 these horrific attacks on civilians show khartoums confidence that there will be no real consequences for its actions its time for the security council to prove them wrong
200456 darfur is the focus of international attention and many western nations want china to play a bigger role
200457 this is why i have been appointed as the special envoy of the chinese government on the darfur issue
200458 since last may i have visited sudan four times in the future if it is necessary i will pay more visits
200459 we have a good relationship with sudan we have some advantages in talking to sudan so we should use this as leverage we will persuade them in a direct way to work with the international community and be more cooperative
200460 as for the olympic games any advice or comments even if it contains misunderstandings or criticism we are open to and welcome this advice
200461 we are willing to listen to any comments that contain reasonable elements but for those few who attempt to tarnish the olympic games on the pretext of issues totally unrelated to the olympics like the darfur issue we are firmly opposed to such attempts
200462 since my birth ive never seen planes bombing like this there were no warning signs the attack would come
200463 we were able to bring nothing with us some people were lucky and had time to gather food but i brought nothing out apart from my children
200464 most refugees are in a state of shock especially those still unable to trace family members from darfur
200465 let us shout out in one voice stop the killing
200466 wei jingsheng is the best known chinese human rights and democracy fighter and is the leader for the opposition against the chinese communist dictatorship
200467 courage to stand alone letters from prison and other writings
200468 in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends
200469 we are ready to work with the u k and the rest of the international community and contribute to the resolution of the darfur issue
200470 were going to urge the government of sudan to show more flexibility and to be more cooperative
200471 rolling out the hybrid peacekeeping operation and resolving the darfur issue require the joint efforts of all sides
200472 first the sudan government should cooperate better with the international community and demonstrate greater flexibility on some technical issues next anti government organisations in the darfur region should return to the negotiating table
200473 in the political process several months have passed without substantive progress
200474 should use their own influence to work on all the sides
200475 we are ready to work with the u k and the rest of the international community and contribute to the resolution of the darfur issue
200476 were going to urge the government of sudan to show more flexibility and to be more cooperative
200477 this is deeply concerning and we are making every effort with the chadian authorities to get these refugees moved quickly
200478 women report being raped children have been separated from their families
200479 it is because of them that we have the problems we have today
200480 they gave no reason for their actions but it was clear the relocation would not take place
200481 trying to find a solution to this problem which is leaving the refugees extremely exposed and vulnerable
200482 the area is highly insecure with roaming armed groups posing a real threat to the refugees and aid workers
200483 its up to him i am going to the olympics i view the olympics as a sporting event
200484 i do remind him that he can do more to relieve the suffering in darfur
200485 there are a lot of issues that i suspect people are going to opine about during the olympics the dalai lama crowd youve got the global warming folks you got darfur
200486 i am not going to go and use the olympics as an opportunity to express my opinions to the chinese people in a public way because i do it all the time with the president
200487 i was pretty well backed off of it by a lot of folks here in america who care deeply about the issue once you make that decision you have to rely upon an international organisation like the united nations to provide the oomph
200488 it is a decision i am now living with and it is a decision that requires us to continue to rally the conscience of the world
200489 it is only in the united states that a penniless survivor of the holocaust and a fighter in the anti nazi underground could have received an education raised a family and had the privilege of serving the last three decades of his life as a member of congress i will never be able to express fully my profoundly felt gratitude to this great country
200490 defined by courage optimism and unwavering dedication to his principles and to his family
200491 the world is running out of patience over whats going in darfur
200492 not to do things that will cause the international community to impose sanctions on them
200493 to link the darfur issue to the olympics is a move to politicize the olympics and this is inconsistent with the olympics spirit and will bear no fruit
200494 all i can say is that they were school age
200495 people are fighting each other and trying to drive them out of the area we have to evacuate people
200496 the government is doing this to try to influence mediation efforts
200497 after stealing the elections from kenyans kibaki now wishes to deny them justice and peace
200498 what is really happening is a continuation of the ethnic cleansing that railas people are doing to kill the presidents people
200499 for the umpteenth time we again ask president kibaki and orange democratic movement leader mr raila odinga to work for peace truth and justice
200500 the necessary weapons and ammunition to exterminate the african tribes in darfur
200501 they shoved a guard and tried to force a gate and behaved in a very rude way
200502 my heart our hearts are breaking for what happened in cambodia today especially for the survivors of genocide
200503 our goal today was to deliver these flowers in deepest respect to honor those who have perished here in cambodia and in darfur and in all genocides everywhere
200504 why dont they just go to china to do that
200505 its pretty harsh to be against a ceremony that honors the victims of darfur and genocide survivors everywhere
200506 our resolve is still the same which is to go forward
200507 its really difficult how anyone can be against honoring survivors of genocide particularly as cambodians
200508 we do not want to see any trouble or confrontation with them said touch naroth the police chief for cambodias capital phnom penh but we simply cannot let this group breach the law either
200509 the olympic games are not a political issue therefore we wont allow any rally to light a torch
200510 we will not support the activity we will not allow them to politicise the olympic games
200511 the symbolic olympic torch relay is urging the chinese government as both olympic host and sudans strongest political and economic partner to use its special influence with the sudanese government

200577 career lobbyist steve stivers is trying to create a fake debate about debates because he doesnt want to talk about his record of standing up for special interests like big oil
200578 we have already agreed in premise to three debates and we look forward to hearing his defense of failed economic policies that have created the mortgage crisis stagnant wages and skyrocketing gas prices mary jo has spent her entire career working for working families and during our three debates the people of central ohio will have a chance to compare those records
200579 the is no reason why this country cannot become the least reliant on foreign sources of energy i call it the second declaration of independence than any other country in the world
200580 we dug deep and rooted out fundamental flaws from there we trimmed streamlined and restructured the result is a leaner stronger treasury we are effectively doing more with less than in years past
200581 the is no reason why this country cannot become the least reliant on foreign sources of energy i call it the second declaration of independence than any other country in the world
200582 fact that a great many jewish neoconservatives people like independent democrat sen joe lieberman and the crowd at commentary plumped for this war in iraq and now for an even more foolish assault on iran raised the question of divided loyalties
200583 age old anti semitic canards about a jewish conspiracy to control and manipulate government
200584 a man who cannot control his anger and even hatred
200585 when commentary writer jennifer rubin or abe foxman calls me anti semitic theyre wrong
200586 clearly recognize that the u s plays a strong leadership role
200587 if our people our troops the men and women in uniform particularly out in the combat zones with all that we had going on had an idea however they acquired it that their commander was at odds with their commander in chief that is a situation which is intolerable to my mind
200588 we have a very strong vested interest in regional security
200589 we need to remain engaged and the u s as the only superpower is needed to lead that effort whether we want to or not but i think we will want to
200590 bleeding hearts of pounding joy that this yields a national dialogue especially given the behavior of iran recently
200591 the presence of u s forces in the region should come down as things stabilize in iraq
200592 move to more of an air and naval presence more of the offshore presence the idea that well have a lot of land forces in the region strikes me as unlikely
200593 we need to work with the rest of the world to have access to this global treasure
200594 era of american hegemony if it existed in the 90s is ending
200595 he was at times cautious but overall he supported the point that there needs to be much more of an international open discourse to address security concerns in the region
200596 a priority for me is to set a national strategy for the world and then work down to the middle east region
200597 wed like to remove friction that would lead to conflict
200598 turn cross site post requests into data less get requests
200599 if i could only have a grandson before i die

200601 ah inilah caranya untuk amerika syarikat merancang untuk menaja kegiatan subversif di malaysia
200602 imf telah mengakui bahawa arahan kepada ekonomi asia slepas serangan spekulatif pada 1997 98 telah menyebabkan krisis yang berlaku bertambah teruk

200604 ya pembangunan ekonomi menjadi kukuh rakyat bebas dari kemiskinan tetapi semuanya adalah di atas permukaan sahaja di bawah terdapat rasuah tiada ketelusan pemerintah kuku besi dan tiada kebebasan media

200609 there was understandable disappointment among harry potter fans when only one copy of the tales of beedle the bard was offered to the public last december
200610 i am therefore delighted to announce that thanks to the generous support of bloomsbury scholastic and amazon and with the blessing of all the wonderful people who own the other six original books the tales of beedle the bard will now be widely available to all harry potter fans
200611 notes by professor albus dumbledore which appear by generous permission of the hogwarts headmasters archive
200612 dumbledores commentary on the tales which was discovered among his papers after his death includes some historical notes personal reminiscences and insights into that most mysterious branch of magic wandlore
200613 i very much hope that readers coming to these classic wizarding fables for the first time will find his commentary both entertaining and helpful
200614 to benefit institutionalized children in desperate need of a voice
200615 on december 1st of 1981 where were emmett and rosalie that night at dinner
200616 senator john mccain is a man of extraordinary integrity who i believe has and will always put our country first
200617 writing and recording raisin mccain is my contribution to his campaign its my hope that this song will unite young conservatives rally support and excitement for our republican presidential candidate and ultimately inspire people to vote
200618 gillar inte n r det klirrar men n r det prasslar
200619 qualquer habilidade sobrenatural m gica ou n o que as classes permitam realizar
200620 were ready to move from sports and olympics to news the moment something really serious happens here
200621 i always personally hope that its basically an olympics about sports but if it isnt going to be sports well be ready for news
200622 i dont sit before you today to ask that you ban the paparazzi
200623 im asking you to regulate it officialize it tax it legitimize it
200624 i dont want to beg the city of los angeles to give me 1987 back
200625 i love being a famous musician in 2008 this is about safety
200626 just for personal reasons and you know because its miley and theyre gonna do good were gonna do good too the audience is gonna vote so well see
200627 were not gonna see it until its live so i have no idea
200628 yeah i was surprised it got so big that we had to do it somewhere like this
200629 the tension is building up and people are getting nervous were gonna smoke the audience
200630 what do you expect i mean were real people i have nothing bad to say about anybody
200631 but i mean i like everybodys verse because i think that lupe killed it kanye killed it mine was more about style than how dope the rhyme was it was really my melody that i liked more than anything thats why my vocal approach was a little different from what you would hear me do i wanted to just do something different that would look different on me
200632 the concept is based on old 80s video game graphics playing behind us while were rhyming
200633 we just want to have fun with the project in a day and age where the record industry is what it is im lucky enough to be on a label that understands and theyll just let us have fun
200634 all the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
200635 we think that everyone nose in its current form already hits a certain demographic a certain way so i just wanted to go and do something different
200636 i understand that ms spears is reluctantly agreeing to extend those letters
200637 after the eighth album im done i already feel it i love acting i love my music like i said but i feel it after this one probably one more in me and thats eight like im one album behind nas and thats crazy
200638 its funny because everybody always wants to talk about you know bow wow doesnt curse hes clean which is true
200639 i think a lot of people that are jumping on bow wow now are new people and if you listen to my first album i was being bad on my first album
200640 i still have the younger generation the younger kids look up to me then again i have that other fanbase who was with me from the jump who are now adults too and its almost like i gotta cater to both but if i miss one of em theyll go find that other person to fill that slot
200641 i know the girls theyre going to go crazy when they see it
200642 the ladies are gonna go crazy when they see bow wows first sex scene its crazy cause for me it was normal it was normal but i know when i look back at it when i see it im gonna be like damn look at this this is crazy i stun myself sometimes i cant even front
200643 it was with a porn star i dont know her name
200644 she probably watching this like what i did a scene with him and he doesnt remember my name nah i dont remember her name but she was bad though she was baaaaad i was cool i was comfortable with it i was definitely comfortable with it it is what it is normal stuff that happens
200645 miss hilton was not asked nor did she give permission for the use of her likeness in the ad and has no further comment
200646 i went and got a fake id with a different name and i have a pair of sunglasses and a hat
200647 the game is incredibly accurate its identical and its so intuitive for me as a player that i have become better at my instrument its gotten me a hotter girlfriend its made me better looking and ive made more money since playing it
200648 that or you pick out of a hat which is not fun we can run faster than dashboard confessional so if it comes down to a foot race it should be us
200649 were working stuff out with his management and were talking about splitting the cost of a ping pong table to take out
200650 it was pretty much the same with the last record
200651 weve been working on acoustic guitars and then trying to bring it all together as a full band were not sure whats going to happen yet but weve been having a lot of fun we havent stopped writing songs since we stopped recording pretty odd because we have a lot to write about
200652 its sounding pretty awesome which is probably what were going to call the next record
200653 weve got quite a few new ideas and songs weve been working on and were hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year
200654 i can tell you its on our latest record its in the middle somewhere
200655 i think at the end of the day it was one of those situations that caught me off guard
200656 i didnt realize i was working so hard to actually capture his attention that really showed me thats the day i realized i made it
200657 the concept is to bring all the people together as one person linking as one world at the state of where the world is now with all these wars and conflict all over the place i think a record like that is needed thats the best time when a voice needs to be heard i felt like what better voice between me and mike to be able to say something like that at the time we in outside of trying to do a club record or a record we expect to get thousand of spins it was more so lets do a record that fits all formats but also has some meaning to it but of course for the future well be finishing up the rest of the record
200658 were gonna set up a whole tour around it its a big play
200659 she was mad cool down to earth yet conservative polite she felt like a high school friend she felt mad approachable cool as hell we had a great time working the chemistry was right on point the record shows it because we came up with a smash
200660 i realize i been foolish i never should have turned my back
200661 cause its a cold world when youre out there all alone so many times i wanted to pick up the phone and tell you ooh baby baby i miss your loving so
200662 do you think we can pick up where we left off before the day that i told you it was over packed my things and moved away
200663 she really aint actually we switched some words around so people dont think she was singing about bobby this record is more of a record that anyone going through that situation would be able to relate to its just the fact that she got out of a situation is what made it more relevant im doing two records for her album
200664 being able to put all my love of chinese culture into a fantasy like the mummy and the wildness of it that was a challenge i couldnt turn down
200665 weve taken the premise of relocating the oconnells from egypt and putting them in china which is as we all know another archaeologically rich nation a long time ago rob was a harvard major in archeology with a special interest in chinese studies so this was a passion piece for him
200666 we have an idea of what he does how he does it
200667 getting to help defeat jet li that was kind of fun jet li is someone that is a power and entity
200668 i really wanted to say hey i helped beat jet li up
200669 they would have to sew me in in that first fight every time i flipped my pantyhose were always down around my ankles
200670 if you notice since britney spears started wearing clothes and behaving paris hilton is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
200671 if the ones that attract the paparazzi behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 percent of the problem the rest we can deal with
200672 i forget the exact terminology but the comment was made in terms of her activities now seem to be that shes calmed down and shes in a relationship thats quieted her down and as such she seems to be attracting less attention and theres less activity that the paparazzi all of you are focusing on
200673 get out and vote or the end will be near
200674 the world is ready for change because obama is here
200675 any chair unless hes paralyzed yeah i said it cause bush is mentally handicapped
200676 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to this song is not only outrageously offensive to senator clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
200677 i heard about his skills when he was doing his thing in chicago i definitely heard some rumors that he was going to run but i just wanted to feel his vibe man hes real down to earth his energy is great hes just an honest dude and hes all about change im all for change im just pro obama i dont think theres anybody better who can be put in that office right now besides that man
200678 i knew it was going to turn heads and that it was going to make a statement and we really appreciate that
200679 weve always been a band thats had things about us and things that are going on that creates big bold waves and whats so weird about the perception of the crusade is we wanted to show people that were not just a band thats going to stick to the same formula every time on that record we accomplished our main goal and that was to make it the exact opposite of 2005s ascendancy we didnt want to do anything that happened on that record on the next one but we still wanted to keep it us because we feel were a band that can broaden its sound and not just stick with one thing it was still metal and it was still trivium just different and diversified
200680 with this new record it basically summarizes everything we feel weve done right as a band that we feel are key ingredients of trivium all rolled into one with a new direction on top of it
200681 so it does have a little bit of everything weve done and some more it has as much singing on it as
200682 with the crusade we were done with screaming done with bands that did it done with doing it ourselves
200683 we just didnt want to do it anymore but when we started jamming for shogun and we heard how brutal and heavy some of the stuff was its the heaviest sh weve ever done before we tried singing over it and it wasnt right what was it missing the screaming and thats exactly what it needed
200684 we decided to take an old school approach to the record using new school technology purely for convenience because tape takes so f ing long to record with
200685 nick made us play this record the way metal is done these days you track it a couple of times make sure its perfect and then you go in and fix a couple of the pieces retrigger the guitars and drums thats just the way it is but we wanted to go back to the old school way record everything right with no triggers on our drums we had to make sure the performance was there and the energy was there and hearing the end result the stuff nick drew out of us is just unreal in terms of heaviness and brutality its the best thing weve done before wed never really considered ourselves a contender for even the word heavy or brutal but this time things are different
200686 just a big combination of everything wed loved as kids
200687 everyone weve played it for theyre all really excited about it
200688 i think weve found our sound weve just discovered it and with the next one i think well define it it takes a band a little while to find their sound some bands get it on the first record and some bands it takes several i think were one of those bands thats going to develop and fully come into our sound someday we dont know what record that will be but this record is even closer to what its going to be
200689 its so great to go out and play with guys you know so well
200690 apart from the fact that we have fun on the road that were friends the shows are very spontaneous were able to give and take because we know each other so well we make our shows different every night which is great
200691 if you go back and listen to the first album you might find that its pretty eclectic

200709 somebody is trying to raid his company whether it is his business partners or whether its the state
200710 the fact that there has been something like 14 different law enforcement investigations into tnk bp and dudley over the last few months suggests that somebody is behind it i cant say who is raiding but i can definitely say you can call it raiding
200711 there is a respectable company called mechel we invited the owner and chief executive of that company igor vladimirovich zyuzin to todays gathering but he suddenly got sick
200712 well in the first quarter this year the company exported raw materials at half the domestic market price that is the world market price and the margin is where in the form of taxes to the state illness of course is illness i think that igor vladimirovich needs to get well soon otherwise well have to send him a doctor to clear out all these problems
200713 why did this have such resonance because in the first place the market as a whole is not in the best shape and such harsh remarks tend to cause a strong reaction on nervous markets
200714 this doesnt resemble the khodorkovsky case zyuzin isnt interested in politics he has never engaged in politics and isnt putins political competitor
200715 but he is putins business competitor putin is a businessman he is the boss of a large chekist business empire
200716 our law enforcement and state institutions should stop terrifying business
200717 bp thought that they owned and controlled their company and all of the sudden they discover that they dont control it i would guess the next step is that they find out that they dont own it
200718 this says something very profound about property rights and it says something very profound about the rule of law which is that property rights and the rule of law dont exist in russia

200792 to defend something is always to discredit it yes the person who defends that has never believed in it if he does believe then the enthusiasm of faith is not a defence no it is the assault and the victory a believer is a victor
200793 thou shalt not extinguish thine anger but shall master it that thy conscience may not be blunted by adjustment to wrong causes
200794 where tdk is most critically lacking however is where iron man cranks pitch after pitch over the wall the humanizing element of humor the baseline acknowledgment that if theres no laughter then theres nothing worth saving
200795 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death they have to take revenge against anyone who did not agree to accept the prophet mohammed like the jews who are seen in the koran as monkeys and the sons of pigs they speak in terms of historical rights that were taken from them in the view of hamas peace with israel contradicts sharia and the koran and the jews have no right to remain in palestine
200796 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family the patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah together with jesus in the kingdom of god
200797 as a child i grew up in a very religious family on the principle of hatred of israelis the first time i encountered them was at about the age of 10 when soldiers entered our home and arrested my father until then i had never been separated from him we didnt know anything about the circumstances of his arrest his membership in hamas was a secret matter and we certainly didnt think he was one of its founders i didnt understand anything about politics or religion i only knew that the israeli army had arrested my father repeatedly and for me he was everything a good loving man who would do anything for me he took care of us bought us gifts gave of himself whereas the soldiers entered our house and took him away from me in high school i studied sharia islamic law in 1996 when i was only 18 i was arrested by the israel defense forces because i was the head of the islamic society in my high school its a kind of youth movement of the organization and my process of awakening began
200798 until then i knew hamas through my father who lived a very
200799 nobody knows them and how they operate as well as i do for example i remember how the family of saleh talahmeh a member of the military arm of hamas who was assassinated by israel was forced to beg for financial assistance because they were left with nothing after his death the hamas leadership abandoned them as well as the families of other shaheeds martyrs while the senior members of the organization abroad wasted tens of thousand of dollars a month only on security for themselves
200800 even some of the current leaders of hamas were involved in the past in the security arm in the prisons so that he is among those responsible for these acts they were suspicious of prisoners who spent too much time in the bathroom even if it was only an upset stomach they suspected that the prisoner was transferring information or alternatively having sexual relations with other men a homosexual the gays were immediately suspected of collaboration then i understood that not everyone in hamas is like my father hes a nice friendly man but i discovered how evil his colleagues are after my release i lost the faith i had in those who ostensibly represented islam
200801 youll see this interview will open many peoples eyes it will shake islam from the roots and im not exaggerating what other case do you know where a son of a hamas leader who was raised on the tenets of extremist islam comes out against it although i was never a terrorist i was a part of them surrounded by them all the time
200802 it began about eight years ago i was in jerusalem and i received an
200803 i feel that christianity has several aspects its not only a religion but a faith i now see god through jesus and can tell about him for days on end whereas the muslims wont be able to say anything about god i consider islam a big lie the people who supposedly represent the religion admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is i have no doubt that theyll go to hell i have a message for them there is only one way to paradise the way of jesus who sacrificed himself on the cross for all of us
200804 only those christians with whom i met and spent time knew about my decision for years i helped my father the hamas leader and he didnt know that i had converted only that i had christian friends
200805 you have to understand i was never one of them although i helped my father and accompanied him i was always opposed to the use of terror hamas members didnt like me i didnt come to pray in the mosques i hung around with strangers they didnt like my leather jacket or even my jeans they considered it going astray but i helped my father and conducted his affairs because hes my father not because hes a leader in hamas im not a hamas activist who converted to christianity thats not the story i wanted to help my father understand that harming innocent people is forbidden and through him perhaps to change other peoples thinking
200806 when i was with my father i in effect pushed a moderate hamas leader into
200807 but within hamas there were other leaders mainly from the gaza strip and damascus who thought they had to continue with suicide attacks as an effective means of achieving their aims the problem was that they were stronger than my father in terms of their status in the organization what helped stop the attacks in the final analysis was israels attacks against the hamas leaders
200808 he had no connection to the military arm but they always consulted him about strategic decisions the hamas leadership did not make decisions only according to the opinion of the organization leaders in syria or gaza however you have to remember that the hamas leadership in damascus was in control of the organizations money therefore it had the most influence on organization policy they were also the only ones who were not restricted in contacting one another as opposed to the leaderships in the west bank and gaza so that they also served as go betweens among all the groups in hamas and incidentally although they now claim that the revolution in gaza was not planned i can tell you from clear knowledge that a year earlier in the summer of 2006 they spoke among themselves to the effect that if the tension with fatah continued they intended to take control of the strip
200809 i like his voice but dont always understand the words
200810 i respect israel and admire it as a country im opposed to a policy of killing civilians or using them as a means to an end and i understand that israel has a right to defend itself the palestinians if they dont have an enemy to fight will fight each other in about 20 years from now youll remember what im telling you the conflict will be among various groups within hamas theyre already beginning to quarrel over control of the money
200811 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death they have to take revenge against anyone who did not agree to accept the prophet mohammed like the jews who are seen in the koran as monkeys and the sons of pigs they speak in terms of historical rights that were taken from them in the view of hamas peace with israel contradicts sharia and the koran and the jews have no right to remain in palestine
200812 more than that an entire society sanctifies death and the suicide terrorists in palestinian culture a suicide terrorist becomes a hero a martyr sheikhs tell their students about the heroism of the shaheeds and that causes the young people to imitate the suicide bombers in order to achieve glory ill give you an example i once met a young man named dia tawil he was a quiet boy an outstanding student not a muslim extremist and not radical in his ideas against the israelis i never heard extreme statements from him he didnt even come from a religious family his father was a communist and his sister was a journalist who didnt wear a head covering but bilal barghouti one of the heads of the military arm of hamas in the west bank didnt need more than a few months to convince him to become a suicide terrorist
200813 do you know that hamas was the first to use the weapon of suicide bombers against civilian targets
200814 they are blind and ignorant its true there are good and bad people everywhere but hamas supporters dont understand that they are led by a wicked and cruel group that brainwashes the children and gets them to believe that if they carry out a suicide attack theyll get to paradise but no suicide bomber will find himself there and no virgins are waiting for them after they have carried out an attack they have to understand that islam was created by people and not by god
200815 in my eyes there were all cruel ugly inside but i think that mahmoud zahar one of the leaders of hamas in gaza is one of the worst
200816 people with an open mind i liked to walk around among the buildings the restaurants the people to feel the night life i have many friends there whom i would like to see and i dont know whether ill be able to do that at all i mainly miss my mother my brothers and sisters but i know that it will be very difficult for me to return to ramallah soon
200817 i hope that ill succeed one day in becoming a writer in order to write about my personal story and about the middle east conflict but at the moment at least my ambitions are only to find work a place to live i have no money i have no apartment i was about to become one of those homeless people but people from the church are helping me im dependent on them
200818 i left behind a great deal of property in ramallah in order to achieve true freedom i wanted to get to quiet surroundings that would help me to open the eyes of the muslims and reveal the truth to them about their religion and about christianity to take them out of the darkness and the prison of islam in that way theyll have an opportunity to correct their mistakes to become better people and to bring a chance for peace in the middle east i dont give islam a chance to survive for more than 25 years in the past they scared people and in that way they prevented anti religious publicity but today in the modern age they wont be able to hide the truth any longer
200819 i hope that someday god will give the opportunity to meet the right one she will have to be a believing christian and if shes a jew who converted even better
200820 many people will hate me for this interview but im telling them that i
200821 la salmonella es una bacteria que se encuentra en todo el campo mexicano es normal que haya salmonella la hay en todos lados por eso los an lisis de eu la encontraron en las muestras de agua estancada
200822 fuimos al terreno donde se supone estaba sembrado el chile hace 60 d as quisieron tomar muestras del estanque del agua que se us para los chiles esa agua tiene 60 d as
200823 ah se concentra el chile que se exporta principalmente a estados unidos pero en esa concentradora entre 70 u 80 del chile proviene de hidalgo y de tula pertenecientes al estado de tamaulipas
200824 est siendo una etapa de muy mala suerte para m pero no me voy a rendir estoy dando lo mejor de m mismo para volver lo antes posible todo estaba marchando bien en los ltimos d as y esto es un duro golpe para mi pero sigo siendo optimista de cara al futuro
200825 el sorteo ciertamente pod a haber sido mejor para nosotros les seguiremos para prepararnos para los partidos en la ida tendremos que conseguir un buen resultado para el partido de vuelta
200826 eran el mejor equipo al que pod amos enfrentarnos en esta ronda sin embargo estoy seguro de que el atl tico tambi n hubiera preferido otro rival esta es la clase de enfrentamientos que puedes encontrarte en los octavos o incluso en los cuartos de final
200827 todos los equipos son dif ciles y cuando hay un sorteo como este tienes que enfrentarte al equipo que el destino elija para ti nos ha tocado un equipo alem n muy fuerte pero en cualquier caso vamos a darlo todo para ganar la mayor a de la gente dice que es mejor jugar el partido de vuelta en casa
200828 somos un equipo que est creciendo y trabajando hemos fichado buenos jugadores y hemos estado trabajando mucho los dos ltimos a os para llegar a este nivel vamos a ver si manuel neuer est en listo para jugar porque es un gran portero y puede marcar la diferencia tienen dos o tres jugadores croatas importantes creo que ivan rakiti tambi n est lesionado rafinha est en pek n como sergio ag ero han fichado a jefferson farf n que es un gran atacante y tambi n tienen a halil altintop son un equipo muy dif cil pero aqu estamos
200829 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
200830 or if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt
200831 thats why today im announcing a two part emergency plan to help struggling families make ends meet and get our economy back on track

201069 we are going through a very hard gut wrenching time
201070 the real peak for small caps was about july last year so weve had 12 months of it now a volatile weak market
201071 its tough some people want to close shop people in the sector are struggling and saying what went wrong
201072 but you just know youre going to get hurt for a little while
201073 sometimes it feels as though youve had the energy sucked out of you but you know the next 12 months is going to be the great buying opportunity you know thats when youve got to go on the front foot but you cant see it at the moment because every time you buy something you get belted
201074 its a hybrid between a media stock and an internet stock its got reasonably good growth and the market has taken it from 1 70 to 52
201075 its now on eight times this years earnings and once the economy recovers it will probably grow at 20
201076 weve refined it over time and over the 10 years it has worked well but it hasnt worked in this market to date
201077 we thought we were fairly well positioned in companies with good balance sheets with very little debt but in the small cap industrial market it has proven to be virtually irrelevant
201078 now this isnt overriding but you will mark it down in your head if a chief executive has facial hair youll want to know why because it is not the norm if theyve got a lot of jewellery especially on their pinkie youll say why have they got that
201079 i pay particular attention to a managing director who talks about his team rather than about himself some of them will say ive done this ive done that but it is the we that counts an i person generally will stumble the really good managers dont even think about saying i they dont have to go around and brag about what theyve done
201080 its about australias best chief executives the criteria were that you had to run a company for a minimum of 10 years and you had to outperform the sharemarket over that period
201081 its basically a book about why these people have delivered to shareholders and why theyve run great companies
201082 they faced their problems and the tough things head on and they resolved them they didnt dodge bullets they took the bullets and said i can get over this
201083 usually you might interview someone for an hour and talk about the business and the financial details such as profits and margins with the book ive been able to look at them 10 years down the track and examine why and how theyve done it
201084 challenges not universally shared by its major australian bank peers
201085 the negative outlook reflects both the potential impact of weaker credit conditions in nabs core geographies as well as ongoing dislocations in credit markets
201086 the bank retains considerable flexibility to address some key challenges arising from weaker market conditions
201087 i cant see how you can have a recession when export prices are going through the roof
201088 economically most emerging countries really looked to have decoupled for 18 months as we slowed and they did not but in a global recession no one decouples as german french and british growth slowed rapidly in the last six weeks a global slowdown looks more likely and more painful
201089 there is now fresh evidence that at least a dozen major economies and some emerging markets are at risk of a recessionary hard landing the list includes
201090 the united states japan united kingdom spain ireland italy portugal canada new zealand estonia latvia and some other south european emerging markets moreover even in the rest of the eurozone germany france etc there is now evidence of a sharp growth deceleration and if the advanced economies are sharply slowing down or entering a recession the idea that china india the other brics and emerging markets can happily decouple from these recession or sharply slowing economies is far fetched
201091 last october i said we were within 18 months of the start of another bull market in equities
201092 in his own special way mr paulson provided the investment world with a buy signal
201093 as republicans scramble to staunch a november bloodletting at the congressional level theyre casting a fearful eye at the electoral punch the obama machine will bring to the fight
201094 i think youll see house members who won their last race by 60 65 lose because of the turnout model that obama brings
201095 a dying republican party faces complete annihilation obama predictably crushes john mccain 59 32 connecticut rep christopher shays is all that stands between wall to wall democrats in new englands house caucus in new york republicans may well be left with just two of 29 seats come january
201096 theyve lost 1 million registered voters since 2004 while democrats have gained 700 000 younger voters are trending toward obama 63 26 and are poised to turn out in record numbers
201097 wealth managers are having a bad time with equity markets as volatile as they are
201098 when the market rallies companies like this outperform a lot more than the market does the reverse is what theyre suffering now
201099 our result for the 2008 financial year has been affected by external factors including the global credit crunch volatile equity markets and a succession of severe weather events
201100 did you ever want to fuck me please dont lie

201108 i think we have to spend more than they do
201109 i dont think we have to spend a lot more but i think we have spend more than they do and were completely capable of raising that
201110 you may feel following a review of your lending policy that criteria should be tightened
201111 slow to appreciate the nature and scale of the market turbulence
201112 pressures on personal finances are also constraining demand not only for
201113 there seems to be a sentiment around property and property exposure which is causing these issues
201114 the lack of confidence is a little endemic and it is running across the market
201115 confident that it will be a lot more than 80 in the dollar
201116 i can tell you i want it off quickly i want it resolved quickly and i want us to move forward
201117 what weve done is the right thing and we are in the right space
201118 we see australia strategically as an important destination for us not just in realty development but also to pursue further trade relations
201119 india is already a strong trade partner with australia youve got indians investing in the resource sector in australia a number of indian it firms are already present in melbourne so yes looking at the overall potential we see a great opportunity for us to set up a base in australia
201120 we believe whether its 800 or 1000 apartments its going to get absorbed
201121 weve got a lot of international owner investors and we get a sense that the domestic market needs an extremely good product of mid to higher end
201122 his attitude made it clear that the only way i could have been able to stop what was happening was to direct the bank
201123 despite what i sensed then that his policy change was going to do me in i wasnt prepared to do that id spent a decade trying to build the bank i couldnt pull the carpet straight from under them
201124 particularly warm and comfortable about this for the first time a labor oriented coterie of mates led by bernie at treasury surrounded the labor treasurer
201125 assume a napoleonic capacity himself in the sense of taking quick strategic action in the area of monetary policy
201126 i said to bernie weve got to be quick and flexible
201127 but bernie said he had to put a high priority on holding the board as one and i wanted to strengthen bernies faith in himself as an independent central banker like the head of the us federal reserve so we did nothing he wouldnt go against this black fool and the price of not going against him was that the monetary goose got well and truly overcooked
201128 to cut rates so close to an election would be seen as political can you believe that political by saying that to me they implied that they should have been cut
201129 the reserve banks 1994 monetary policy decisions were a very bad policy misjudgement inflation was not at risk
201130 political government is there to cop it never give the suckers an even break or if you can manage it never give the cabinet an even break the keating government was worn out by jumping through policy hoops which the reserve bank put in place
201131 im told that bernie saw me as the man in the asbestos suit that i could take any amount of fire and still come out on top because i had been prepared to go along with the interest rate structure of 1989 90 i would take 2
201132 the reserve bank wanted to make a crushing blow against inflation and thought that i would be able to run it on through the election but this was one carry too far
201133 the on site bmd team committed to achieving this pilot and integrated a significant amount of additional record keeping into their daily activities

201139 they want to do more adventurous things and they do so
201140 and a lot of them are quite bored just sitting on a beach and they want to do something adventurous
201141 but people are prepared to take the risk of not buying
201142 but it must be borne in mind that the figures for court repossession orders are likely to present a far bleaker picture than we find with actual repossessions

201152 enough talk of drilling already i am sick to death of reading the same shortsighted garbage about how we need to lift the tax on gasoline and drill the coast into invironmental catastrophe to knock a few cents off of gas prices tax gas more and use the revenue to fund new infrastructure for alternate plans how dumb is this populace that when confronted with the end of oil the only concern is if gas can be cheaper for six months rather than making a switch that would be a lot cheaper than running the country into the ground when oil prices inevitably skyrocket as the oil wells run dry when you have 2 billion people in india and china to whom incidentally we owe trillions of dollars for our national debt who are using oil at an exponentially incrasing rate its not going to be too many years many people say 12 about long enough to fix this mess if lawmakers decide not to be abysmally stupid drive less and youll get the same savings as dropping the tax and avert a massive econimic and environmental crisis oh thats right you dont want to pay an extra 25 cents to drive to the mall to buy chinese imports please stop this moronic drill drill drill drop the tax conservative tripe

201261 en todo momento estamos abiertos al di logo y si lo hubi ramos hecho cortado di logo y ser violentos no se hubiera hecho presente la intendenta a las 2 de la ma ana en el mismo recinto ocupado lo que dice la conadi es una gran falsedad
201262 todas las organizaciones mapuche y sociales deben sumarse a esta justa y noble causa
201263 injustificada la actitud del gobierno que no da posibilidad de di logo
201264 yo le preguntar a qu pas antes de la violencia qu pas porqu anda en la calle desde los 11 a os porqu ella se ha convertido en una activista desde los 11 a os es eso lo que esperamos de un ni o de 11 a os que ande reclamando como dec an ellos hoy por las ballenas ma ana por la ley general pasado ma ana por la causa mapuche por supuesto que hay responsabilidad de los padres los padres somos responsables del comportamiento de nuestros hijos

201291 shares in suncorp fell 13 as the company issued a profit warning the market is punishing companies that are not meeting expectations at this stage
201292 the responsibility for the costs of the refloating operation plus any charges for ship repairs will be borne by the ships owner
201293 the most sizeable and visible impact on retailers initially will likely be the introduction of unit pricing and a grocery price watch scheme
201294 the impact will be negative given consumers are likely to shift towards the most effective pack sizes suggesting that industry revenue will fall
201295 the state is by no means out of the woods
201296 business and industry across the state that rely on gas as a primary fuel source will continue to operate in a constrained market until full supply is restored
201297 having 80 terajoules in that pipeline from apache by tuesday and 110 terajoules by the end of the week and shortly thereafter up to 220 terajoules means that a very much improved situation is in front of us
201298 we are looking to expand our network all the time and there may be one more australian destination on the cards

201306 youve got the wrong guy try one of our branches they will know what to do
201307 you could look at the last 10 years as a history of double or nothing
201308 most of this blueprint should not be implemented until after the present market difficulties are past
201309 what they should do is to say there are now two completely different businesses
201310 one is a business its impossible to regulate in a sensible way weve tried and were going to say now its caveat emptor so if you want to put your money into this good luck
201311 i dont think that they are going to do it they are going to try to regulate it the poor buggers
201312 so much has changed in such a short period of time it snuck up on many many people
201313 the bottom line is we have an impact on the global economy flowing through to australia from the credit crisis coming out of the us subprime
201314 i dont know whether we are halfway through or whatever
201315 its a very serious problem and the more serious the problem the more diffi cult it is to determine how long it will last
201316 people in the capital markets talk about pre august post august
201317 that was when subprime started to hit you could see an earthquake coming and it played out soon after that and it had all sorts of implications right across the markets
201318 our data was telling us back in july that this just cant last forever
201319 it felt to us like just before the introduction of the gst in 2001 payment days started to expand out thats generally the first sign of any financial distress we started to see an increase in the number of defaults particularly around mobile phone debts and credit card debts it happened pretty suddenly
201320 falling share prices have a big role in determining business confidence
201321 we are seeing falls in confidence which are now very large by historical standards which are increasingly reflected in the hard data
201322 and this has been caused of course by the us subprime financial crisis which has hit the stockmarkets worldwide very hard
201323 its had quite a devastating effect on the mortgage industry
201324 now the big banks are the only ones who are able to loan in any significant volumes we have lost competition
201325 up until thursday august 9 2007 life was cool for us
201326 the market was clearly in turmoil in subprime we are not in subprime on thursday things changed it was suddenly impacting everyone
201327 the australian economy would have been slowing anyway as a result of higher interest rates whether there had been a subprime market crisis or not
201328 it just would have meant more of a response from the rba instead of the commercial banks
201329 this is not the greatest time to start off being in government thats for sure
201330 the big difference between subprime and dotcom is that subprime wasnt only wall street its also main street it has hit america in its heartland
201331 in most of my time it has been the us first daylight second
201332 we are seeing a very awkward period of adjustment as the us identifies for itself where it now belongs and theres lots of fallout
201333 i have no doubt that we are simply in another downturn that will be followed by a period where theres much more confidence
201334 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
201335 the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
201336 mom how do i handle all the practical things such as care of the house bills insurance

201344 the directors believed that the company would be able to reach agreement with its bankers regarding appropriate levels of funding but noted that there was a material uncertainty as the groups ability to continue as a going concern
201345 the companys bankers have now informed cains that they are not prepared to support the proposals that have been put to it by the company
201346 conditions remain challenging with the period since 30 june 2008 having witnessed significant volatility and a further decline in the leading financial market indices
201347 however the board remains satisfied with the financial position of the group and with its prospects for developing the business further
201348 as a result of this the company is seeking to raise additional capital to strengthen its financial position
201349 in this regard the board is reviewing its strategic options for the future financing of the company which may include considering proposals for an offer for the company

201363 this has been one of our best years ever and what stands out the most for me is that our achievements include a mix of our new young directors and a range of clients and brands the year started off with mtn clap by greg gray being recognised at international awards such as d amp ad and allan gray winning silver at cannes and now we have won the grand prix at the loeries it definitely is teamwork and we couldnt do this without strong scripts from the agencies great clients and our suppliers

201373 i look forward to working inside one of the best athletic departments in the country and competing at the highest level of collegiate lacrosse
201374 i dont think that it was racially motivated but i think there are racial overtones to what did happen
201375 i think the incident started with a mistaken identity situation but i think that once it escalated to the point of the beating that there will be racial overtones that come forward remarks that were made insults language that would be racially inflammatory
201376 we have to look at look at how can this happen
201377 it doesnt matter in terms of colour or gender or whatever how does it happen that someone can be so severely attacked on our main street and with absolutely no connection to the people who attacked
201378 im realistic en bough to know that an incident like this is going to give some people pause but i think that for the most part the people in this community will understand that this is absolutely an unusual incident and not the type of thing that happens on a regular basis in owen sound
201379 what would be very upsetting is that these young hooligans will have changed that for the community and theres no way that they should be allowed that kind of power

201384 but i think its a logical extension of our gamercard gamertag and achievements
201385 people want to personalize their gamertag and so when we look to the future and think about building a brand new xbox experience avatars is a logical extension of that innovation i think its another avenue of self expression and there are a lot of opportunities here for consumers

201542 growth is set to continue as consumers become more comfortable with the security aspects of trading and purchasing online it was not long ago that consumers were uncomfortable with even purchasing low ticket value items like a cd today we are seeing consumers purchasing items costing thousands of pounds
201543 we have seen sales growth among the older generation of silver surfers and women they now see the value of technology and have more disposable income than previous generations meaning technology products are becoming a part of the dna of their lifestyle they now embrace technology and understand the ease of use and convenience of online shopping better than ever
201544 2007 has been a great year for amazon co uk not only have we seen the launch of four new stores sports amp leisure jewellery amp watches shoes and baby but we have seen record breaking sales for the likes of harry potter and the deathly hallows and the exclusive catherine tate comic relief special dvd the proliferation of broadband in uk homes is certainly allowing a greater proportion of the uk public the opportunity to shop online this means that every age group across both sexes is now well represented in the share of internet retailing spend whilst there are certain areas that have seen accelerated growth like the so called silver surfers there will be a continued strong increase in internet retail spend across all groups of the uk adult population for a good time to come this promises to be our biggest christmas on record and we look forward to serving millions of customers with an incredible product selection at customary low prices and with a delivery option to suit every shopper
201545 what is going to be number one selling album at christmas is the burning question on everyones lips its looking set to be the battle of the divas with play com already receiving massive pre orders on leona lewis kylie minogue celine dion and the spice girls however when it comes to gifting anything goes the now thats what i call music series always does well with the general public and live lounge 2 and radio 1 established 1967 are already proving very popular choices with our customers if we had to suggest what will be the biggest seller on the site as a gift purchase we think itll be a 3 way fight between kylie leona and westlife who should never be underestimated in the christmas market last year they took on both oasis and the beatles and won music is a great gifting option at christmas it is affordable accessible and instantly rewarding
201546 shoppers continue to use the internet as an easy way to seek out best value especially at christmas time when budgets can be tight
201547 royal mail is geared up to deliver a record breaking online christmas and expects to handle more than 100 million gifts and presents ordered on the internet during the festive period royal mail has responded to the needs of the online shopping community both shoppers and retailers with the introduction of a new service which improves the delivery experience royal mail tracked enables retailers to provide their customers with a tracking number when the goods ordered are dispatched so that they can track the progress of their delivery themselves the service also enables retailers to give their consumers the opportunity to specify an alternative delivery point such as a porch shed or a neighbour should they not be at home to receive the item this new service builds on the success of royal mails local collect service which enables online shoppers who are not at home to take delivery of an item that cannot be posted through the letterbox the opportunity to ask for it to be taken to a post office branch near their home or work

201553 siamo rimasti un tantino spiazzati dalla vicenda mutu vicenda ormai chiusa ci dobbiamo riorganizzare per rinforzare la rosa e lavorare in questa direzione
201554 io lavevo detto in precedenza in unintervista insieme a zambrotta sono due grandissimi calciatori per poi ci sono delle situazioni che non sono confrontabili con le nostre possibilit e non possibile andare a percorrere certe strade quindi non vera la voce su etoo
201555 alberto stato quasi sempre infortunato lo scorso anno e non si potuto esprimere al meglio perch dovuto andare a mettere a posto una condizione fisica di continuo sono sicuro che questanno ci riuscir resta se qualcuno aveva dei dubbi un problema suo
201556 mutarelli ha fatto vedere di essere un calciatore serio perch ha una duttilit nei ruoli di centrocampo che pu fare comodo a molti ma noi a centrocampo siamo a posto
201557 baptista un giocatore diverso pi attaccante andrebbe fatta unanalisi pi particolare
201558 la gara con lo steaua ci ha fatto comodo per riorganizzare la testa dei calciatori e fargli rendere conto quali saranno le fatiche mi aspetto oltre a quello che sar un allenamento in pi anche qualcosa in quella direzione
201559 non c percentuale ancora presto cercheremo lavoreremo sulle gambe poi sar un mantenimento questi 15 giorni ci servono per ritrovare ritmo e livello di fatica necessari
201560 sar fondamentale la risposta di oggi domani lo lascio ad allenarsi domani penso di poter usare tutti e 22 calciatori
201561 pu darsi ma julio sergio lo conosco bene mi serve conoscere meglio artur quindi potrebbe giocare anche lui
201562 no un bravo ragazzo ma non pu essere non ci riguarda come trattativa
201563 la logica che ha fatto un buon campionato che avr la possibilit di giocare di pi di poter guarire in tranquillit da un infortunio molto serio e grave
201564 noi stiamo lavorando e le trattative sono aperte sia in uscita che in entrata una linea di scelta ce labbiamo per sempre un valutare quello che pu essere possibile che pu succedere cerchiamo uno fisico una punta esterna
201565 secondo me quasi tutti bisogna essere disposti a fugarsi di chiunque giocatore si parli poi costa di pi silva piace a tutti ma non pu venire secondo me perch ha costi e squadre che gli sono dietro lo ha detto anche aragones a me piace anche torres podolski non si incastra bene nelle nostre richieste
201566 potrebbe essere perch lo vedo voglioso carico ed uscito fuori dal problema dellinfortunio quando un calciatore non pu svolgere lattivit per lungo tempo viene sempre penalizzato allinizio comunque si pu essere lanno del suo rilancio
201567 bisogna fare un numero corretto di calciatori se si trova la situazione giusta per lui per farlo giocare e far vedere le sue qualit si fa altrimenti rimane con noi perch ci servir e ci dar sicurezza
201568 no se si va a vedere la squadra che ha segnato pi di tutte il fatto di chiudere le partite non sempre facile per ci proveremo a volte erano partite chiuse ed invece poi lavversario ha pareggiato o vinto
201569 lufficio marketing pu darci un contributo importante e se la roma cresciuta merito anche loro

201583 i was so angry with my toddler son when he was tantrumming and refusing to eat that i grabbed a tuft of hair on the back of his head and pushed his face into his bowl of spaghetti his face was covered in spaghetti sauce the look on his face was of total shock but i was still so angry that i did it a second time
201584 i was so angry with my toddler who was screaming and screaming that i rammed his pushchair into a wall i knew it wouldnt hurt him because the front wheels would hit the wall first and i just wanted to give him such a shock that it would stop him from screaming he wasnt hurt but i was still raging so i slammed him into the wall again
201585 its amazing what you will do to get your kids to stop them from their tantrums

201597 since the cloning of dolly the sheep and the first derivation of a human embryonic stem cell line by jamie thomson some 10 years ago its been the hope of scientists to generate stem cell lines that have the genes of a patient

201605 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
201606 it was fun when we were older too of course but when i was a child with my brothers that was really something

201610 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
201611 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
201612 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
201613 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
201614 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
201615 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
201616 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
201617 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
201618 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
201619 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
201620 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
201621 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
201622 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen
201623 so far the fight has not hurt shareholders in reliance companies at all but it has reached a threshold where it could affect the growth of both groups
201624 the message being sent the international investment community is to stay clear of these guys
201625 the pollution is a very visible presence but it hasnt been an issue for the athletes
201626 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy sitting next to him repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
201627 when he was attacking him he was calm it was like he was at the beach
201628 he went back to his seat and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it to us like that and then dropped it on the ground in front of us
201629 and id like to say from my standpoint it tastes very fine
201630 the fact that it melted at zero degrees centigrade leaves very little doubt
201631 we believe al qaeda is doing some measure of reassessment regarding the continued viability of its fight in iraq and whether iraq should remain the focus of its efforts
201632 this is the result of south korea us alliance and trust having been restored
201633 the exceptionally swift measure reflects president george bushs full understanding of the south korean public sentiment and the deep trust and friendship between the leaders of the two countries

201637 hes telling mr mcclelland to get stuffed thats exactly what hes done
201638 no respect for the grieving families involved or the cultural sensitivities of aboriginal people
201639 the problem with politicians getting to know the issues in indigenous townships is that we tend to suffer from what aboriginal people call the seagull syndrome we fly in scratch around and fly out
201640 the difference between this trip and all my other trips to indigenous areas is that im going to be there for three weeks and im going to be performing whats a useful task in the community instead of coming in sitting down with council stopping at the local art shop and then going
201641 i think it is important to say well these things matter and i think it is important to break out of that routine of office of white cars sittings of parliament and endless rounds of meeting people in suits
201642 if you dont make time to do these sorts of things it will never happen and youll become a prisoner of the standard round of politics
201643 our insurance is not worth the paper its written on
201644 home warranty insurance is a joke people need to understand that they are not insured
201645 little or no protection for consumers yet comes at significant cost
201646 buying a home is the biggest purchase of our lives but that purchase process is treated with total disrespect
201647 should have known the risk of falling asleep while driving
201648 the message has got to get through to people that they cant drive when theyre tired
201649 theres enough evidence there that it looks like these people really did know about these special directions
201650 the problem with all of this stuff is you are never 100 certain are we constructing something with our 21st century minds that wasnt actually intended by the people who built it
201651 the project was not without risk but deserting those who were assisting australian troops and because of that were at risk of persecution was not an option for the australian government
201652 we are thankful the project appears to have been successful
201653 these iraqis have repeatedly shown their commitment to australias security and reconstruction operations in iraq
201654 i have formed a cabinet so that the japanese people can feel the fruits of the reforms
201655 push for policies so that people can feel their livelihoods are improved
201656 i would like to ask the opposition party to think about whether confrontation just for the sake of making mischief is a good thing
201657 what voters want isnt a change of ministers but a change to policies that will safeguard peoples lives
201658 we are determined to change the government in upcoming elections
201659 this conveys the message that fukuda will stay in his job and try to win public support
201660 to tide over what appears to be the biggest crisis since the partys foundation
201661 they have also accepted to donate the rest of his organs to save greek people
201662 if it happens we will be pleased because it means we wont be at war but it is not going to happen any time soon
201663 we did go into the kitchens of some of these families and believe me there was nothing
201664 weve noticed that market prices for staple foods in pyongyang rice maize potatoes eggs were all going through the roof sometimes quadrupling what they were before
201665 sie erkennen den moment der abtreibung daran dass sie starke blutungen und kr mpfe haben nachdem die abtreibung vollzogen ist werden sowohl die kr mpfe als auch die blutungen nachlassen
201666 frauen haben das absolute recht selbst eine abtreibung durchzuf hren
201667 und womanonweb org ist der einzige weg in diesen l ndern zugang zu abtreibungspillen zu erhalten es gibt einfach keine andere m glichkeit auf ein selbstbestimmtes leben bis sich die abtreibungspolitik dieser l nder ndert
201668 ich fand es gut zu hause abtreiben zu k nnen so war das ganze weniger dramatisch und weniger klinisch
201669 alleine zuhause zu sitzen und zu warten dass die blutung beginnt ist der pure horror
201670 trotzdem ist die zahl der frauen die sich durch eine abtreibung schwere sch den zuf gen ohne zugang zu medikamenten deutlich h her
201671 mir ist wichtig dass in einer gesamtbetrachtung sowohl pers nliches verhalten als auch die politische lebensleistung in die beurteilung einbezogen werden
201672 wolfgang clement hat durch sein politisches lebenswerk erhebliche und beachtenswerte leistungen und beitr ge erbracht und sich damit um die spd verdient gemacht
201673 dass er dies auch k nftig als mitglied der spd aus ihr heraus wird leisten k nnen

201675 ich h tte es nie f r m glich gehalten dass das recht auf freie meinungs u erung in der partei willy brandts so gering gesch tzt wird das war undenkbar f r mich
201676 zum ersten mal scheint der linke fl gel ber eine mehrheit in parteivorstand und parteirat zu verf gen
201677 es hat doch ohnehin seit monaten niemand mehr geglaubt dass wolfgang clement spd mitglied ist da w rde es auch keinen berraschen wenn er es nicht mehr ist wer sich so unsolidarisch verh lt muss mit einer solchen entscheidung rechnen

201680 christians are supposed not merely to endure change nor even to profit by it but to cause it
201681 hating people is like burning down your own house to get rid of a rat
201682 i would rather live in a world where my life is surrounded by mystery than live in a world so small that my mind could comprehend it
201683 god is not a cosmic bellboy for whom we can press a button to get things done
201684 dont simply retire from something have something to retire to
201685 a person wrapped up in himself makes a small package
201686 god has put within our lives meanings and possibilities that quite outrun the limits of mortality
201687 he who knows no hardships will know no hardihood he who faces no calamity will need no courage mysterious though it is the characteristics in human nature which we love best grow in a soil with a strong mixture of troubles
201688 life consists not simply in what heredity and environment do to us but in what we make out of what they do to us
201689 the tragedy of war is that it uses mans best to do mans worst
201690 we cannot all be great but we can always attach ourselves to something that it great
201691 a bear dragged the man for about 5 6 metres towards the forest and tried to bury him it didnt succeed so it abandoned him there

201704 you will not be able to publish posts to your blog until we review your site and confirm that it is not a spam blog
201705 id hear a song on the radio and wish mine was next but i respect a lot of the artists whove come along since i was out especially rihanna shes smart and shes worked the business instead of having the business work her
201706 ive been planning my wedding in my head since i was a little girl and it just keeps getting more elaborate im a huge fan of the caribbean so if i dont get married in new york it would have to be on the beach
201707 if they think its too difficult then theres no way i should even attempt it
201708 saat ini kita merasakan kualitas kehidupan sebagian masyarakat kita jauh dari tingkat sejahtera
201709 memasuki bulan agustus saat kita mengadakan peringatan hut proklamasi hendaknya perlu diingatkan kembali kondisi bangsa yang belum sejahtera
201710 tetapi lebih dari itu jadikan masa kampanye ini untuk tidak saling memprovokasi yang bisa berdampak pada kondisi masyarakat yang tidak aman
201711 auditing team about the validity of the ranking as some big companies which have come under public scrutiny earned a better ranking
201712 there is nothing serious lapindo does to handle the mud flow
201713 they threw the mud into the sea through the porong river
201714 we did it to the sea after obtaining green light from the government
201715 we continue to keep our operations in accordance to the health safety and environment standards despite the mud flow
201716 simply let your yes be yes and your no be no anything beyond this comes from the evil one
201717 we are all proud and we are happy to see our king crowned and we wish he will lead us to a new life and a new prosperity
201718 an important fact about who she was that couldnt be changed and her parents didnt want to accept that
201719 only mr newman knows the context which he intended the comments to have
201720 in my mind he made a stupid and inappropriate comment
201721 they are completely unacceptable comments and channel nine needs to address the issue
201722 sam is horrified by suggestions he made a lewd remark about ms wriedt
201723 if everything sam says is going to be analysed i think were going to start to become terribly unfair
201724 once told me that it was better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open ones mouth and remove all doubt
201725 melburnians would argue to their death that you can get a better coffee in melbourne than anywhere else in australia
201726 weve actually got not just superficially but deep in our culture a great knowledge and appreciation of coffee and certainly a mythology about it
201727 weve always thought there was something like a 40 chance of a recession
201728 now at best were looking at slow speed growth with the non farm urban economy close to recession
201729 i am certainly very flattered to have been considered for this role very keen to be articulating a strong vision for the city of melbourne
201730 at this stage we are not going to be releasing detailed policies except to say we are a passionate and energetic team who are seeking to deliver a strong vision for the city
201731 we are going to be talking about the detail of all that over the course of next few weeks
201732 ask your family workmates or friends whether japan planned to invade australia in 1942 the chances are that many will say that they thought they would have if only they had not been stopped in the coral sea or was it kokoda
201733 we now know without doubt however that while the japanese high command did consider an invasion it decided against one
201734 invasion was impracticable in early 1942 and the course of the war soon made it impossible
201735 go back and die with my family rather than die in the detention centre
201736 he was being targeted before he left for what was perceived to have been his position on things
201737 we sent him back to a place where he was assassinated
201738 the rain weve had so far this season is helping storage levels move in the right direction but below average run off tells us that the catchments are still recovering from a dry autumn
201739 our wettest months are normally august to october so sustained rainfall in that time will help us
201740 it was more than wild it was complete chaos ive never seen an ocean so angry and confused in all my surfing days we managed to catch a few each but must admit that the ocean beat us to a pulp that day we were lucky to have all made it to shore to tell you the truth
201741 we had difficulty back filling the positions we thought we had someone but we were gazumped
201742 we are down on numbers so weve had to put the pump program on hold for a month other things are higher on the priority list like dealing with the really sick kids who are newly diagnosed
201743 one of the issues is that the group being diagnosed is much younger so they are more complex to look after but the august suspension is a one off
201744 tafe is often used by lower income people therefore increasing fees and having students pay it off by effectively borrowing will be a very strong barrier to participation
201745 is a key part of making the system fairer to all victorians
201746 the international olympic committee president jacques rogge met the chinese to discuss this problem all along the ioc has not shifted from its stated position and that was to have no censorship of the internet
201747 the chinese have the right to close down sites that are pornographic or subversive but otherwise everything that should be free and wasnt now will be a team has been put in place to commence normal access to the internet
201748 its only inevitable that people from different countries and regions of the world dont see eye to eye on certain issues i dont think politicising the olympic games will do any good to address these issues
201749 we will continue pursuing comprehensive reforms including reforms of the political system
201750 even this current controversy raises questions about why he is taking such a stance is he criticising his ioc colleagues is he berating the chinese what is the end result
201751 of course china has made promises but when push comes to shove there are limits to how far they are prepared to go
201752 were going to change the way things are done here
201753 my youre doing very well much better than last time
201754 no trees were harmed in the sending of this message however some electrons got terribly confused
201755 the ground rules on censorship have been changed this certainly isnt what we guaranteed
201756 it is clear that the staging of the olympic games will do a lot for the improvement of human rights in china
201757 in fact the crackdown on human rights defenders journalists and lawyers has intensified because beijing is hosting the olympics the authorities have stepped up repression of dissident voices in their efforts to present an image of stability and harmony to the outside world
201758 in january 2008 the authorities declared an intention to promote and extend the use of lethal injection as a more humane method of execution across china
201759 these people have long since been engaged in anti china splittism activities and hostile sabotage activities under the banner of so called human rights and religion by arranging such a meeting the us side has rudely interfered in chinas internal affairs and sent a seriously wrong message to the anti china hostile forces
201760 the korean state nurtured certain new industries selected by the government through tariff protection subsidies and other forms of government support until they grew up enough to withstand international competition
201761 trade liberalisation has been the outcome of economic development not its cause
201762 most poor countries would have deindustrialised or never industrialised at all
201763 well before the switch to meters it would cost me about 20 or 25 from here
201764 no i answered a question but you flipped the meter i thought it would be whatever the better price would be
201765 no its 20 with tip or i call the police
201766 i dont want to file a complaint i just want to know what regulation he broke
201767 what rule or law did he break i want to print it out so i can have it on me next time i take a cab
201768 we have to send the right message scapegoating migrants for a failure to plan and a failure to deliver basic services is wrong its appalling its pretty low
201769 john brumby is trying to blow some dog whistle that somehow or other he can pull a string and stop people from coming here
201770 if you look at all of the things ive said over the years about economic growth about population growth the contribution of immigration to our community you wouldnt have had a stronger champion than me
201771 people living in disadvantaged areas experience both greater losses per adult and higher rates of problem gambling in a systematic way
201772 it is clear that much further action is required by government to address the entrenchment of disadvantage indicated by the data
201773 the government knows there is an over concentration of machines in areas of disadvantage but have done nothing meaningful to address the situation
201774 its a super regressive source of revenue and the government needs to recognise that its coming from alp heartland blue collar working class people
201775 i cant understand why they make such a fuss about don all he was good at was cricket
201776 this confirms that the government took the right step in bringing funds forward for this program and ensuring that they go to those australian families that most need financial assistance to install solar systems in their homes
201777 it would be interesting to see who is making these applications some of these businesses have hundreds of people on their waiting lists
201778 there isnt a rational reason for the australian position because australia does sell uranium to nuclear weapons producing states including china
201779 the npt is fundamentally an immoral piece of law it is the last vestige of apartheid in the international system
201780 it is a law that says five countries are entitled to have something that no one else is which really is what the world fought against in overcoming racial discrimination laws
201781 to argue on the basis of the existence of that law that somehow you can sell uranium for chinese or french or brits or americans to have evil nuclear weapons but not for indians implies a moral differentiation about india im not prepared to tolerate
201782 it was not just transport it was fun now i calculate it costs me 6 for a round trip to werribee plaza
201783 it is costing me 180 a week for fuel i cant sell the car for much and if i buy a new one ill be losing money on the repayments im stuck in a trap
201784 has ruled that non eu nationals married to eu citizens are entitled to live in their spouses country
201785 was brought by four african men married to eu citizens resident in ireland pictured above the men had been refused residence permits
201786 because they had heard about eu rights staying six months and then going back to the uk
201787 was no more than a temporary absence deliberately designed to manufacture a right of residence for mr akrich and to evade the provisions of the united kingdom legislation
201788 a non community spouse of a union citizen who accompanies or joins that citizen can benefit from the directive irrespective of when and where their marriage took place and of how that spouse entered the host member state
201789 if they have legally resided in another eu state before they first came to the uk

201824 es war ein schock f r dich ich wei nicht wie oft du nachts schreiend wach wurdest im albtraum mit schaum vorm mund
201825 i learned something about kids and kayaks and i thought id share here those of you with kids may find it useful
201826 last year i found a umiak at a garage sale
201827 i also picked up a used umiak for a 6 year old julia we have been out on one paddle so far on the chicago river the paddling part was ok but it didnt take long for julia to get tired or bored but when we returned to the dock at oakton she decided she wanted to paddle more and we went south on the river that is when the fun started she quickly found soccer balls that had been lost to the river we worked our kayaks around the tree branches to get the balls and then used our paddles to move them upstream until julia decided to chase them down pick them up and put them in her cockpit as her reward for the trip in a few weeks we are spending a week on a lake in northern michigan so i will try out all of these ideas and hopefully she will come up with some of her own and i will share them
201828 we have twins almost 7 and have been canoeing with them since age 3
201829 put the kayak on the beach and fill it with water and toys put it upside down on beach now it might be a den for plastic animals or other creatures i had a great fear of water when i was three and these are similar things my dad did to get me used to and loving water boating thanks for the great ideas ill definitely use them as my son gets older
201830 my daughter quin and i have been paddling a lot this summer last weekend we did our first canoe overnight we paddled the wisconsin to the mississippi for three days just the two of us paddling and camping as for kayaking with her she rides in the open rear hatch of my biggest kayak remember to put floatation in your open hatch here is a link to quin in her own kayak last winter
201831 i always let my niece and nephew be kids mud on the ends of canoe paddles is always fun watching the shoreline for frogs and turtles is another big hit and the all time favorite splash your sister or brother a book that some of you may be interested in is kayaking made easy by dennis stuhaug he devotes an entire chapter to paddling with kids and covers both getting kids started touring day trips with kids too young to be in their own boat presented from a kids point of view theres lots of wonderful ideas and perspective in a few short pages

201836 most states do not require commercial drivers to provide medical certifications to be issued a commercial driver license instead many states only require individuals to self certify that a medical examiner granted them a medical certification allowing them to operate commercial vehicles thus meeting the minimum federal requirements as a result we found several commercial drivers who made false assertions on their self certification that they received a medical certification when in fact no certification was made
201837 fmcsa and its state partners conducted more than 3 million roadside inspections more than 145 000 citations were issued to drivers who did not possess their medical certificates and more than 42 000 citations to drivers with expired medical certificates
201838 we have made little progress in the number of deaths from crashes involving large trucks since fmcsas 1999 founding in 2006 4 995 individuals were killed in 2007 the national highway traffic safety administration reported that heart attack or other physical impairment was a critical factor in approximately 4 000 serious truck crashes
201839 that was nearly 10 years ago and still we have no final rule
201840 if everybody is thinking alike then somebody isnt thinking i remember i use to order snack wraps with no ranch then id ask for honey mustard and put it on my snack wrap 3 weeks later i see a commercial and im like nope 2000 black metallic 5s nope mork and mindy hey little mister gimmie some cash cuz im high as well and im ready to blast i throw bread around just to turn pigeons on f s vnds puma x mihara yasuhiro pack highs size 8 f s franco shade harajukulovers nike alab flannels m l joined jul 12 2007 posts 4091 feedback try to erase me from your memory to late im ingraved in history speak my name and breathe life in me make sure yall never forget me cause yall use my name so reckless whether to be accepted or disrespected and i love it especially when yall do it in public and im the subject cause yall my n ggas

201873 listen a sower went out to sow 4 and as he sowed some seed fell along the path and the birds came and devoured it 5 other seed fell on rocky ground where it did not have much soil and immediately it sprang up since it had no depth of soil 6 and when the sun rose it was scorched and since it had no root it withered away 7 other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no grain 8 and other seeds fell into good soil and produced grain growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold

201881 we feel the impact of the low dollar but we dont suffer too much from it we never bought expensive things anyway
201882 with job losses mounting prices rising increased turbulence in our financial system and a growing credit crunch we need to do more
201883 mccain relies on a single quote from obama who once and only once so far as we can find suggested taxing
201884 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
201885 played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
201886 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
201887 i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with
201888 given the seriousness of the issues given the fact that the decisions we make right now are going to help determine the future not just of the next generation but perhaps generations after that given the magnitude of our challenges when it comes to energy and health care and jobs and our foreign policy youd think wed been having a serious debate but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears
201889 following my appointment as a non executive director at the time of the clubs takeover by gs amp e in january this year i repeatedly sought confirmation that public pledges of an investment of 50m 18m to purchase shares 22m to clear debts and 10m for new signings were being honoured right up to the moment i discovered that my position had been terminated no answers were forthcoming nor was there a single official board meeting at which these crucial matters could be raised an astounding state of affairs for any company let alone one facing up to serious challenges in a difficult business climate
201890 on several occasions after the takeover adam pearson rams chairman of football maintained publicly that the club would go forward
201891 i sincerely hope that in making my doubts about an unhappy situation public i may help to exert pressure on the owners to produce a full and precisely detailed account of the terms of their takeover of the amount of new monies invested the current financial position and the identity of the investors as well as future financial intentions such is my disappointment and sense of frustration about the situation that i now contend that the current owners should either make good their financial commitments to derby county and provide the supporters with proof that their initial promises have been honoured or give me the opportunity to buy the club back and return it to local ownership more atuned to the needs and expectations of its outstandingly loyal supporters

201898 the hp 2133s are outselling the eee pc 20 to 1
201899 and linux only accounts for probably 20 of eee pc sales and less than 5 of overall umpc sales the fact that theres a 500 notebook out there is a big plus but we find most buyers are more than happy to use a license in their office to upgrade them to windows xp
201900 its a give and take between simplicity of usage for the masses versus full customisation
201901 the linux version is really only to use exactly what is provided and someone in the know can easily remove whats been installed but consumers are accustomed to the windows environment and the windows version will be a stronger player eventually

201917 the court has decided that as nevzlin poses a special threat to society he should serve life in a high security prison
201918 the decision of the court was written in advance by the kremlin and there is no surprise in this decision
201919 this is a show trial managed under the supervision of the kremlin and controlled by putin and his gang i intend to appeal to the european court of human rights against this show trial that was held in russia
201920 courts all over the world have ruled that russia is a place of political persecution courts in england in switzerland in the netherlands in israel so the only place such a show trial can be held is in russia
201921 i want to personally make sure that every baby born here will not be hiv positive
201922 this centre is one of several hundred that have received help from the foundation but will soon be one of thousands
201923 so the core problem i see with right wing hacks on fox and talk radio as distinguished from principled conservatives like the ones in my family isnt their violent speech though that is a problem its the hopelessness and fearmongering they sell appealing to the worst parts of people for profit even when there is no overt suggestion of violence
201924 once in power e coli conservatives shrink government by hamstringing it they weaken rules that protect people slash the budgets of consumer agencies and appoint industry friends to oversight commissions the result some government regulatory agencies that we trust to protect us have shrunk to insignificance or serve private industry rather than consumers
201925 mr obama said the country is facing an economic emergency and convened an hours long meeting with economic advisers monday but laura tyson former chairman of the national economic council said the record deficit was not specifically mentioned we actually didnt discuss the number that came out today she told reporters adding that participants instead talked about adding extra spending on roads and other infrastructure that democrats hope will boost the sluggish economy mr obama has talked about proposing a 50 billion package if he wins office
201926 not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
201927 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
201928 now i want to go ahead and tell you the truth which is we will not eliminate the deficit or the national debt in the next four years or even in the next eight years
201929 i am a progressive but i always tell people that if youre a progressive you should be fiscally even more conservative than the so called conservative on the one hand im a strong believer in fiscal responsibility on the other hand we actually have to make some significant investments in order to keep our economy competitive and uh so what i want to do is institute some basic principles that will move us in the direction of fiscal responsibility without making a fetish of perfectly balancing the federal budget
201930 give me an example of how senator obama is going to cut the deficit
201931 i really think its important here to make a distinction okay i will you need to define for me wolf which deficit youre talking about
201932 no no no no no wolf as you know first of all there is a structural budget deficit and cyclical budget deficit
201933 explain how hes going to cut either one of those just explain how hes going to cut the deficit
201934 im about to im about to the structural budget deficit the biggest driver of the structural budget deficit over the next 20 years is health care is health care and he has a meaningful health care reform that is paid for if the meaningful health care reform is enacted it will bring down the structural deficit that is a major part of deficit reduction
201935 there are legitimate questions about both the clinton and obama plans in particular whether they make unrealistically low assumptions about the ultimate price tag ms clinton puts hers at 110 billion annually mr obama says his will cost 50 billion to 65 billion and unrealistically high assumptions about how much they can save by bringing costs under control ms clinton credits her plan with 56 billion mr obama claims an extremely optimistic 120 billion the democratic candidates time would be better spent explaining how their visions are achievable not taking potshots at each other
201936 emory university professor kenneth thorpe analyzed the proposals and concluded that taxpayers would pick up a 50 billion annual tab according to thorpe the actual cost of obamas proposal would exceed 100 billion a year actual federal spending under the obama plan could be higher than his estimate thorpe said that 50 billion is really assuming that everything is really up and fully implemented he said and parts of the plan would take more than five years to put into place
201937 if you ask me how hes going to reduce the deficit next year what i will say is that in a bipartisan group of business labor academics there was consensus that the economy needs stimulus the immediate focus is on stimulating the economy not on deficit reduction
201938 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
201939 until he fleshes out his economic plan considerably more its disingenuous to go around claiming his proposals are paid for and that claim is even more suspect considering that his proposals would leave a larger deficit than would the tax laws currently on the books we find his claim to be barely true
201940 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
201941 obama hasnt been very specific about how hed pay for a pretty ambitious tax plan furman said
201942 in terms of tax plans edwards and clinton have more clearly specified where the moneys coming from and going to
201943 for example clinton economic adviser gene sperling in a conversation with cnnmoney
201944 sperling says the key difference between the two candidates proposals is that clinton has been more conscientious and rigorous about finding specific realistic ways to pay for her plans
201945 m r obama appears to have counted the proceeds of a higher tax on capital gains both for his healthcare plan and for an 85bn middle class tax relief plan that he announced in september 2007
201946 the grab for a job democrats turn protectionist on trade and labour
201947 mr obama does expect the winding down of the iraq war to ultimately produce a peace dividend that can be used for other things austan d goolsbee a university of chicago professor who is advising mr obama on economic matters said that any such dividend would emerge slowly and he did not fix a dollar figure on it
201948 views on money for iraq war and what else could be done with it

201985 god essentially created two conflicting accounts of creation one in nature and one in the torah or bible how can it be determined which is the real story and which is the fake designed to mislead us one could equally propose that it is nature which presents the real story and that the torah was devised by god to test us with a fake history one has to be able to rely on gods truthfulness if religion is to function or to put it another way if god went to enormous lengths to convince us that the world is billions of years old who are we to disagree

202115 understanding how these bacteria thrive within us is a critical element of learning how to defeat them
202116 its amazing that the bacteria could learn to extract iron from their environment in this way

202124 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
202125 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain

202139 wir haben gestern eine pressemitteilung des british racing drivers club erhalten wie sieht der aktuelle status in silverstone im moment aus
202140 es ist in der pressemitteilung gar nicht r ber gekommen wie signifikant diese bekanntgabe gewesen ist es war schon immer unser vorhaben gewesen die genehmigung zu erhalten um silverstone zu modernisieren das ist ein andauernder prozess der wohl beinahe f nf jahre ben tigt hat die kommenden zwei jahre werden f r uns entscheidend sein wir wollen silverstone voranbringen mit oder ohne einen grand prix
202141 silverstone soll weiterhin der f hrende veranstaltungsort in gro britannien sein nun hat es schlie lich eine zustimmung gegeben die rtlichen beh rden haben zugestimmt zudem genie en unsere pl ne die unterst tzung des ministeriums f r sport wir sind sehr froh dass die zustimmung nun erfolgt ist nun k nnen wir an unseren zielen weiterarbeiten damit kann silverstone ein potenzieller austragungsort f r einen grand prix werden sollte es daf r in zukunft bedarf geben
202142 es gab ger chte ber streitigkeiten innerhalb des brdc k nnen sie dies best tigen
202143 es gibt immer sehr emotionale und intensive diskussionen unter den mitgliedern sie besitzen die absolute freiheit ber das zusprechen was der klub und was silverstone tut das ist eine der guten sachen am brdc die leute k nnen sagen und tun was sie wollen ziemlich offen aber es gibt ein formales vorgehen bei dem sie f r einen direktoren vorstand abstimmen der den verm genswert von silverstone verwaltet
202144 aus diesem grund denke ich dass diese bekanntgabe sehr wichtig ist denn sie zeigt dass die von uns verrichtete arbeit profitabel ist es ist sehr entt uschend dass die bekanntgabe ber den grand prix getroffen wurde bevor wir eine m glichkeit hatten die genehmigung zu erhalten aber so l uft es
202145 wir m ssen akzeptieren dass donington einen vertrag ber zehn jahre besitzt das war die antwort die wir von der fom und der fia erhalten haben aber unabh ngig davon haben wir f r silverstone ambitionen die wir nun umsetzen k nnen
202146 wir hatten eine solch hnliche situation schon einmal mit brands hatch damals ist ein grand prix nicht zustandegekommen sollte dies bei donington ebenfalls der fall sein w ren sie dann gewillt den gro en preis von gro britannien auszutragen
202147 wir haben schon immer gedacht dass silverstone die heimat des britischen motorsports sein sollte wir haben eine lange beziehung zur formel 1 und dem gro en preis von gro britannien nat rlich w ren wir froh die formel 1 wieder in silverstone willkommen zu hei en wenn sich die m glichkeit auftut

202157 i have never tried to write this thing called a song thats played on radios all around the world that window cleaners hum that people listen to in traffic jams i was never interested in song u2 came about through a sound
202158 the music that really turns me on is either running toward god or away from god both recognize the pivot that god is at the center of the jaunt
202159 even though im a believer i still find it really hard to be around other believers they make me nervous they make me twitch i sorta watch my back except when im with the black church i feel relaxed feel at home my kids i can take them there theres singing theres music
202160 im not exaggerating to say that this music changed the shape of the room it changed the shape of the world outside the room the way you looked out the window and what you were looking at

202206 there is so much literature about various aspects of richard nixon his foreign policy his domestic policy his rise to power his time in power his fall from power his comeback his relationship with vice president spiro agnew his trip to china that it would seem difficult to find an original approach to the man but in nixonland rick perlstein has come up with the novel and important idea of exploring the relationship between nixon and the 1960s counterculture a rebellion of mostly young people against societys conventions and authority in general perlstein is quite right in identifying this rebellion and the reaction against it as critical to nixons rise and his strange hold on the american people one might even consider perlsteins book to be primarily about the counterculture and only secondarily about nixon since he devotes nearly half of it to a brilliant evocation of the 60s

202208 a giraffe in the woods hell never find us here
202209 im a businessman im not here because i think youre nice people i think theres money to be made
202210 i also have this wonderful sense that were doing the right thing were going to employ thousands of iraqis but mostly everything here is for profit
202211 so theres danger everywhere i think the key thing is this will be tremendous for baghdad
202212 even the idea of bringing u s style escapism entertainment to the hell of baghdad is absurd
202213 just watch how much of this infrastructure even gets built
202214 even if they do pull this off then the parks immediate survival like any private business is going to depend on stability and the ability of the iraqi government to control violence and ensure public safety
202215 if the situation in baghdad deteriorates i think the idea that the park will somehow be spared violence is sadly naive at best
202216 the bush junta has already attempted to impose a neo liberal economic disneyland upon the iraqi people
202217 but they have flatly rejected the neurosis of its brand conscious failed capitalism the two geographies meet nowhere in my imagination nor in reality the not so green zone is barely inured from the death destruction and suffering which surrounds it the point is that no gated community is safe from mortars and rockets i believe we are looking at the next evolution of the gated community albeit grossly failed

202224 four survived the crash and have been hospitalised in very serious condition
202225 is this going to result in a kind of blessed censorship of a whole host of areas of medical care and research
202226 they are manipulating the system by manipulating the definition of the word abortion
202227 its another example of this administrations disregard for science and medicine in how agencies make decisions
202228 its a redefinition of abortion that does not match any of the current medical definitions its ideologically based and not based on science and could interfere with the development of many new therapies to treat diseases
202229 over the past three decades congress has passed several anti discrimination laws to protect institutional and individual health care providers participating in federal programs hhs has an obligation to enforce these laws and is exploring a number of options
202230 required to violate their consciences by providing or assisting in the provision of controversial medicine or procedures
202231 in general the department is concerned that the development of an environment in the health care industry that is intolerant of certain religious beliefs ethnic and cultural traditions and moral convictions may discourage individuals from underrepresented and diverse backgrounds from entering health care professions
202232 any of the various procedures including the prescription dispensing and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
202233 any activity with a logical connection to a procedure health service or health service program or research activity this includes referral training and other arrangements of the procedure health service or research activity
202234 at a time when access to health care is at an all time low the idea that the bush administration would be creating more barriers is frankly incredible
202235 you could imagine a group of people with less than honorable intentions seeking to get hired at a family planning clinic with the specific objective of obstructing access under this regulation there is little you could do about it
202236 as soon as you have a definition in one part of federal law it can become the inspiration for the reinterpretation of other statutes
202237 this would essentially simply require people to comply with laws that they have been required to comply with for decades
202238 that does not mean any organization or state cant keep doing exactly what its been doing it means they have to make room for people who have sincere moral or ethical concerns about doing something
202239 health care professionals should not be forced to engage in an action that they see is the taking of a human life federal funds shouldnt be used for that kind of pressure

202490 binatang sembelihan yang merasa depresi sebenarnya mengeluarkan toksin nah daging yang kita konsumsi kan sama saja dengan barang yang sudah jadi karena mengandung toksin dan secara kesehatan ini bisa mempengaruhi perangai kita
202491 pilihan untuk menjadi vegetarian pada masa sekarang tidak seharusnya lagi diembel embeli perdebatan seputar kesehatan agama atau rasa iba hidup vegetaris adalah pilihan moral paling realistis dan jitu untuk membawa dunia keluar dari jerat krisis gizi dan lingkungan

202499 it has certainly been an interesting three weeks for us weve made some friends weve made some enemies but it all started out with 13 strangers walking into this house and basically trying to win 500 000 so you guys are probably sitting here pretty confident in your vote who youre going to be voting to evict but i just want to offer you one thing
202500 only one person in this room is going to win 500 000 not an alliance not a majority of the house one person so you need to take a good hard look at the nominees up here right now you need to decide whos the biggest roadblock in your way to winning that money if its me great ill walk out the door but if its not i would definitely take that into serious consideration before you cat your vote thats a mistake you definitely dont want to regret
202501 i actually think that theres probably some other underlying things
202502 maybe it had to do with a lot of the constant competitiveness of the girls in the house
202503 me and brian are very very good friends i know that he has somebody that hes with
202504 i think it got to the point that when i found out it really bugged everybody in the house it kind of became something like well if it bothers them im going to wear it more
202505 if you accept the offer america will pay you 20 000 to represent them for one week in the big brother game from who to get nominated to who to get evicted and everything in between america will be calling the shots but you must keep it a secret or risk losing everything
202506 this is pretty cool im very blown away very appreciative towards america
202507 on the pro side obviously theres the money im a teacher i dont really need to tell you guys how much money i make i could tell you that this money would make a huge difference for me one con to becoming americas player is i could jeopardize my entire chance of winning this thing but if america wants dan to be americas player who am i to deny america if thats what america wants im on board i will be accepting the americas player offer
202508 this is the moment as nancy pelosi noted that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol

202514 eclipses were reported where none took place in areas of political or bureaucratic strife
202515 wed already known about this eclipse many years before we got the right to host the olympics so how can we explain this is retribution
202516 this project was not without risk but deserting these people who assisted australian troops and because of that were at risk of persecution was not an option for the australian government
202517 we are thankful that the project appears to have succeeded
202518 its giving us a second chance to have a proper future
202519 im happy for the australian government to say to me you are welcome in australia

202524 we have always had an understanding and we havent necessarily talked about it that any sovereign government will block pornographic sites and what they might consider subversive or sites which are contrary to the national interest
202525 i would suggest also that we are not working in a democratic society were working in a communist society this is china and they are proud to be a communist society so it will be different
202526 i believe we are now on the way to getting there
202527 i just got the message early this morning that everything had opened up and im very happy about that
202528 and were keeping our promises when bidding for the games to provide good environment and a quality service for reporters using the internet to cover the olympic games and we administer the internet by law
202529 just shareholders are clearly demonstrating their support of the premier offer and recognising that accepting the offer and benefiting from substantial cash and scrip components is better than risking the offer lapsing and being left with just shares at a likely lower share price
202530 when youre in a crisis like we have now with the global credit crunch a banker has to sort the books out
202531 camerons a bright guy but if he gets it wrong on provisions the brokers will never forgive him when romes burning you really need to get the fire hoses out
202532 an analysts world is built around a computer model they hate earnings surprises because it stuffs up the model so if you surprise them youd better be prepared to wear it
202533 our risk management is a lot better than it was in 2004
202534 but clearly as markets deteriorate thats an area that can always do with more focus and thats going to be one of my priorities
202535 beyond that you start to look at the broader strategic picture
202536 that includes the british business which is not where it needs to be and the great western bank acquisition in the us which a lot of people are struggling to understand
202537 the challenge is to develop a vision for what nab will look like when it grows up
202538 it proves we can beat anyone in the world centre chris anstey told aap straight after the game
202539 we can take a lot of confidence from that especially with bogut sitting out most of the second half
202540 its disappointing to give up a 19 point lead against a very good team but we can still take a lot of confidence from the way we played heading into the olympics
202541 our goal in this process is to encourage staff to donate time in the community in whatever capacity possible
202542 as part of this program we hope to give back to our communities in a way that is meaningful fun and also builds community spirit among our own employees
202543 i am partial to any volunteer work that has to do with children
202544 i hope folks will bring their youngsters and start a generational process
202545 the kids were excited to be allowed to do something to help people and they thought it was cool that kids could actually make such a huge impact
202546 we get the mates we deserve the mates we marry
202547 i made a decision but i didnt ask the lord
202548 when they came near to egypt he said to sarai his wife hey look i know you are a beautiful woman
202549 youre a beautiful woman it will come about when the egyptians see you
202550 they will say to you this is his wife and they will kill men but they will let you live
202551 please say you are my sister so that it will go well with me because of you
202552 what do you want me to do about my career what do you want me to do about my investments what do you want me to do about our financial security as a family what do you want me to do
202553 and it came about when abram came into egypt the egyptians saw the woman was very beautiful
202554 and pharaohs officials saw her and praised her to pharaoh and the woman was taken into pharaohs house
202555 for her sake gave him sheep and oxen and donkeys and male and female servants and female donkeys and camels but the sovereign lord struck pharaoh in his house with great plagues and pharaoh says
202556 your looks for my life your assets to save my skin and insure my success your beauty your charm your wit your loyalty for my pleasure

202563 neue trends aufzugreifen sich nur mit dem besten zufrieden zu geben sehen wir als eine der wichtigsten aufgaben in der markenf hrung an
202564 im verarbeitenden gewerbe entfallen rund 40 prozent der kosten auf werkstoffe und betriebsmittel
202565 studien belegen dass firmen diesen kostenblock im durchschnitt um ein f nftel reduzieren k nnen
202566 die einsparungen sind hier in aller regel doppelt so hoch wie bei einer nachtr glichen optimierung des materialeinsatzes
202567 we geloven dat het politiseren van de olympische spelen niet in het voordeel is van het oplossen van deze kwesties en bovendien de olympische geest geweld aandoet we hopen dat buitenlandse verslaggevers in china onze wetten en regels respecteren objectief berichten en daarmee de communicatie en het begrip tussen china en de volkeren van de wereld bevorderen
202568 die themenwelten sind prima die orientierung deutlich einfacher und wir hatten wirklich viele neukontakte was ich auf die neuen strukturen zur ckf hre
202569 der abschied vom gemischtwaren laden war berf llig und ist prima gelungen

202571 wir haben mit der neuen struktur auf die w nsche von lieferanten und fachbesuchern reagiert und die resonanz zeigt dass wir es gut hingekriegt haben
202572 f r uns war entscheidend dass seitenbetreiber auf deren website das
202573 besonders interessant f r unsere kunden d rfte die kostenlose geld zur ck garantie sein die sie absichert wenn sie beim online kauf in finanzielle vorleistung treten also ein produkt z b per vorauskasse kreditkarte oder bankeinzug bezahlen

202575 we did talk to them a little bit about that
202576 but they did say that they were looking for very premium plus prospects
202577 even with the rental guys wed still be giving one and in some cases two premium guys for a rental guy for two months i just didnt think it was wise
202578 i just think that we didnt do something because you cant force trades
202579 im pretty confident there will be guys that will clear waivers and theyll be available
202580 hopefully the guys we have will get the job done and some of our minor league options also
202581 we are very proud of his majesty he was under pressure to change and he has
202582 in fact he has done more than we could have hoped for
202583 if its not saturday but next week well not make a big fuss about it what matters is to get a clear answer quickly in the very coming days
202584 we are continuing our double approach of dialogue and pressure if dialogue does not work we could continue with additional pressure at the u n or eu level
202585 its by no means a strong report as it continues to show a difficult job market but it isnt a totally awful report either
202586 i dont want to put a positive face on this because this marks seven straight months of job losses and the nation has a seriously challenged employment situation but i guess its all a matter of degree given the economys serious condition its amazing that we havent seen 100 000 per month job losses
202587 we didnt see that surge in hiring that has characterized previous expansions in fact growth averaged about 2 6 in the period and it was the weakest expansion for hiring in about 30 years as a result because companies did not add much to payrolls during the expansion they dont have to pare back payrolls now because theyre already much leaner
202588 refrain from using the phrase in any other current or future materials
202589 unholy grail is a tale rich with intrigue that grips the imagination a must read

202593 he has told us he murdered her on saturday night left her body in the bath and went to a party before decapitating her the following day
202594 the murder was premeditated he turned the music up on the stereo moments before the crime so neighbours wouldnt hear her screaming
202595 he took various photos of the chopped up body with his cellphone camera including photos like those of the taleban where the decapitated head is placed on top of the body
202596 these are not comprehensive or full scope safeguards unlike with nuclear proliferation treaty member states but it agreement satisfies indias needs while maintaining all the agencys legal requirements

202633 for smalls that we deliver currently there is a two inch minimum any potatoes that are below that are not payable
202634 in this particular offer the clause has been changed to an inch and seven eighths that doesnt sound like a lot of difference but probably about 50 per cent of our smalls are in that category so thats an excellent gain we feel for the mccain contract growers

202639 sui precari e sugli assegni sociali abbiamo chiarito dei punti delicati per quanto riguarda gli assegni sociali questi sono garantiti a tutti gli italiani che versano in condizioni economiche disagiate e ne hanno quindi diritto abbiamo invece escluso gli stranieri che hanno risieduto in italia solo per pochi anni per quanto riguarda i precari si chiarito che si tratta di una norma per facilitare lassorbimento e lassunzione a tempo indeterminato soprattutto nelle poste non quindi un attacco generalizzato al precariato le polemiche sono pretestuose le stesse parti sociali sono daccordo e non ci sono pi nemmeno contestazioni sul fronte sindacale

202657 i was telling people all day wednesday that i had better photos
202658 everybody i showed her pictures to said it looks like a dead dog
202659 but looking at the claws and at the teeth in the front it looked like it could be something else something vicious
202660 it looked about the size of an average fox gray in color eyes like a mole hairless and was breathing quite heavily
202661 needless to say we were freaked out by this discovery and fled the area quickly

202730 he kind of makes other guys rise to the occasion and makes the guys around him play a lot better
202731 we have other guys who can do it so it may not be the call for me to do it
202732 so long as its getting done i dont care who is doing it

202741 the current political ambiance created by a populist government with its emphasis on nationalism has made santeria more visible

202813 the big unknown is how future regulatory involvement will impact business technology

202835 we are disappointed by todays verdict but especially disappointed for jills family and friends however we respect the decision of the court
202836 the investigation into her murder was complex thorough and professional with more than 2 500 statements taken and 3 700 exhibits recovered i would like to thank the members of the public who came forward following the murder to give us information in particular those who gave evidence in court
202837 it would not be appropriate to comment any further at this time except to say that we will be reflecting upon todays verdict and considering how best to proceed
202838 mr george now has the right be regarded as an innocent man but that does not mean it was wrong to bring the case our test is always whether there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction it would be wholly wrong to only bring cases where we were guaranteed a conviction
202839 the fact that the trial ran its full course confirms that although it has changed in detail the circumstantial evidence in this case which has been tested over and over again by the courts was judged fit to be put before a jury
202840 nothing it was just like cutting beef except for the bleeding
202841 i took them to send to a brazilian friend in england who cara had stolen money from
202842 he said he was going to kill her i wanted to send them to him by email to show that although he didnt have the courage to do it someone here did
202843 i made a mistake the suitcase was supposed to fall in the river if it had fallen in the river nobody would have found it as they havent found the head and the other parts
202844 i spoke to caras mother and she was very shaken she just kept saying i want my baby she wants her daughter back she kept asking why did he do that
202845 there was blood everywhere on the sofa the walls the doors the skirting boards
202846 shes on tour with benji madden and isnt watching television and has not been on the internet
202847 but shes already said shes not too happy about it
202848 she doesnt consider herself a political figure and so she does not appreciate being used in that way
202849 shed prefer the candidates just leave her out of it

202853 lionel messi is an incredibly exciting player and one who enjoys a world wide reputation for skill pace and all round ability

202865 chemoimmunotherapy reinduction with epratuzumab in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in marrow relapse a childrens oncology group pilot study
202866 we are pleased with these encouraging results in children with all the childrens oncology group cog is continuing to enroll patients into the ongoing phase ii portion of this study and we look forward to their future results
202867 we continue to work with other oncology study groups to implement new clinical trials combining epratuzumab and veltuzumab
202868 earnings in the current quarter were the same as those reported for the first quarter of this year as they were similarly burdened by the costs of new branches and our subsidiary bank romasia the impact of rate reductions on variable rate loans the deployment of funds to repurchase stock and pay dividends and the non accrual of interest on non performing loans
202869 we have seen some modest progress in lowering the level of non performing loans at the end of the second quarter and anticipate continued reductions during the third quarter these loans remain well collateralized and no material losses are expected
202870 also in furthering our ipo growth strategy we added a new branch during the current quarter to the two which were opened this past january additionally romasia bank officially opened its doors on june 23rd and is now serving the asian american communities in its market
202871 considering the recessionary complexion of the economy the continual ebbing of consumer confidence the absence of meaningful residential loan demand and a weakening in commercial loan demand earnings in the current quarter and for the six months reflect an impressive capacity and strength of the company to generate earnings under the most difficult environment banking has experienced in decades
202872 we are very pleased to be supplying a cost efficient solution to the national eisteddfod
202873 they had a need to reduce cables and provide resilience in what can only be described as a large field before the build this allowed us to showcase our satellite broadband solution which when combined with the wireless mesh system produces a platform that eradicates the need for multiple ground based cables previously they had the usual problems running cables across fields on a very busy site with exhibitors and traffic which can damage cables in the build therefore causing a breakdown in the service at various points throughout the ten days
202874 zultys couldnt be more pleased that our u k partners have chosen such a prestigious outdoor event to fully demonstrate the robust integration capabilities and flexibility of our mx communications system we wish all of the eisteddfod participants in wales all the best as they celebrate their welsh heritage and we hope the mx powered network will be music to their ears
202875 firetide wireless networks are designed for rapid deployment and are ideal in environments where permanent infrastructure is not required we are pleased that ethnet selected firetide to serve as a robust and secure communications network for the festival
202876 the site chosen for this years national eisteddfod is a vast area of parkland that runs alongside the river taff in the heart of cardiff the eisteddfod has transformed the ponte canna fields into a thriving festival area comprising a main pavilion surrounded by 300 merchant stands a theatre and many performance and exhibition marquees
202877 its fantastic to be able to offer our members the opportunity to become a millionaire by playing just one of the games on our site were constantly looking to provide the best slots and mini games for our members to enhance their enjoyment and experience of crown bingo
202878 the financing we structured will give equity based services the opportunity to implement their leasing and management systems to maximize and enhance the occupancies and performance of these properties in the current challenging financing environment well capitalized companies like ebs with management experience and expertise are able to secure favorable financing
202879 we are fast movers if a deal makes sense we will close it quickly and move on to our next projects the lending market has greatly improved our business we only work with the best fastest and most reliable partners in the lending market most other players in the self storage arena have been forced out of the market due mostly to the fact that very few buyers have our infrastructure track record lender relationships and management expertise that is now paramount in closing any kind of financing that makes sense in this business
202880 only well qualified buyers with proven operating track records infrastructure and iron clad management continue to secure financing and close deals financing is only being secured by the strongest groups for the strongest projects these projects are those that prove to be win win opportunities for buyer and seller but first and foremost for the lender lenders dictate the market right now they will not provide financing for projects that dont meet or exceed their strict requirements
202881 the pendulum has swung far to the other direction in favor of the lenders it is the lenders who are now calling the shots the bottom line is that lenders will no longer lend on cap rate speculation or unsubstantiated operating income

202891 as an avid music enthusiast im happy to team with wemix com to discover talented new artists and find a song that best reflects me
202892 im also excited about opening new avenues that support my efforts to encourage kids to play the game of baseball the number of african american major league players has dramatically decreased over the last 10 years and were hoping that projects such as this will reverse that trend and get more minority kids into the game

202900 nobody at head start told me i couldnt do something they instilled the idea of possibility in me
202901 head start gave me a foundation and understanding that i was not limited by my situation because of it i didnt know i was underprivileged until i was no longer underprivileged in many ways it leveled the playing field
202902 generally subprime lending and the foreclosure crisis is presented as if it is only an issue for minority and low income borrowers
202903 however the data shows that the problem is much broader than just with minorities and low income households my belief is if we widen our lenses to see that this problem affects all segments of society we will change the tone and context of our approach to solutions
202904 its really doubly special because im standing here on the great wall and watching it

202924 everybody has a camera in their telephones when people can record an event taking place that helps us during an investigation its helpful
202925 i think that while its appropriate for the police department to invite video reports of wrong doing both by ordinary people and police officers the new york police department has a long way to go to ensure that police officers who engage in wrongdoing like what was captured in the two video tapes that were recently disclosed are held accountable

202931 with 29 of respondents stating that they experienced the leakage of employee or customer data in 2007 it is alarming to see that only 11 of those types of incidents went reported
202932 security professionals need to remain cognizant of the regulations that their organizations must comply with and ensure they are taking steps to properly report the security incidents that are required by law whatever they may be
202933 we believe that new media tools redefine who the online newsmakers and reporters are
202934 this is part of the foundation upon which nowpublic is built traditional influence lists are increasingly irrelevant because theyre predicated on outdated factors and metrics
202935 theres a lot of emerging technology that can make a difference
202936 theres a lot of depth this year in areas such as cloud computing virtualization and mobility that didnt exist last year
202937 we have completed restoring mail service including historical messages to all of the 1 of affected members thank you all for your extreme patience during this trying time
202938 by completing this restoration of mail services we hope we have put the vast majority of mobileme problems behind us and can now focus on improving other aspects of this new ambitious service
202939 it seems that while i can log in to mobileme and view my calendar contacts i continue to not be able to see mail as mail comes up as a completely blank page
202940 this campaign has had extraordinary success in engaging children during the last year and the new ads along with the enhancements to the website will continue the momentum
202941 theyve managed to minimize handset share losses even in the face of fairly aggressive competition particularly from the koreans in north america
202942 theyve managed to hang on to more market share than we expected and managed to do it without cutting prices too much
202943 it still has a mountain to climb its product portfolio is still not competitive enough and sustaining its position in the north american market in the second half of 2008 may prove challenging
202944 microsoft has an open intellectual property licensing policy but in situations such as this in which a reasonable licensing agreement cannot be reached despite our best efforts we have no choice but to pursue legal action to protect our innovations
202945 primaxs practice of using our innovations without taking a patent license is unfair to the many companies that have already licensed our technology so we are taking action to protect both our partners and our innovations
202946 big companies like boeing are very serious about going forward with as much commonization and standardization solution sets across as many products and programs as soon as they can
202947 they need to bite the bullet now with significant migration issues rather than continue to go forward with all the disparate systems for every airplane out there
202948 theyll fix it search is an iterative process but what the surge of interest in cuil showed is that theres a huge pent up demand for an alternative to google
202949 dr patterson joined google in 2004 and filed six patent applications
202950 now as an ex googler or xoogler she has focused on some of the weak points in the google approach to search namely privacy and comprehensive indexing
202951 were engineers and we are reading the press for good feedback and critical feedback
202952 if we didnt have improvements to make we wouldnt have a job here
202953 its learning of it at almost the last minute that i think is destabilising the international media and certainly embarrassing for me as up till 48 hours ago i was insisting it would be free and uncensored internet access
202954 weve noticed that the words being used by bocog have changed in recent months from uncensored to what is more like convenient and timely or convenient and available these are quite different words
202955 nevertheless no one has come out publicly and said on behalf of bocog or the ioc sorry but there are certain internet websites which are blocked
202956 its having to find out and get the big surprise by an announcement by bocog at a press conference i think they could have done better
202957 this blatant media censorship adds one more broken promise that undermines the claim that the games would help improve human rights in china
202958 an evil fake religion that has been banned by the chinese government
202959 we went and nobody stopped us so we just shot
202960 lets wait for the wonderful performances when the games open on aug 8
202961 what the chinese tried to do was infiltrate their security to see who in china the tibet movement was talking to
202962 a lot of places in the world including china dont have the same view of personal space and privacy that we do in the united states
202963 youve got to suspect that every place youre doing work is being monitored and being watched
202964 there is no free phish an analysis of free and live phishing kits
202965 this is basically a way to run away from competition youre putting a lot of pressure on your less competitive peers
202966 nokia has always been extremely tactical with its pricing pinpointing sweet spots in different segments of the market and making adjustments to wrongfoot competitors
202967 intel has demonstrated that the performance of their systems can help facebook scale our infrastructure
202968 intel is excited to engage with facebook as they are a dynamic force in the evolution of the internet
202969 we are not suggesting that it organizations stay away from blades blades do address many problems in the data center
202970 what we are saying is that it organizations adopting blades need to be prepared for further changes in this technology
202971 organizations must recognize that blade adoption needs to be a strategic vendor partnership decision and not a tactical purchase
202972 people want ubiquitous cell service on their wireless phones everywhere they go and that includes their home and offices
202973 the airave makes it even easier to get enhanced coverage no matter where you live or work
202974 we want fios to succeed but were going to do what we have to do to protect our jobs and our healthcare
202975 we cant let corporate greed interfere with getting a fair contract
202976 the potential for very short term volatility around specific announcements in the process is predictable but we would be looking to buy verizon on dips rather than attempting to call each up and down tick over the month or so it may take to finally resolve the labor relationship for another period of years
202977 the trend is to access more and more applications in the cloud not call them locally
202978 thats forcing a lot of consumers who dont necessarily want to go with vista to reconsider their overall computing strategy
202979 they can switch to vista buy an apple machine or do something completely different
202980 i believe both gentlemen genuinely wish that we will be able to work together to enhance value
202981 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
202982 in todays corporate governance system where large mutual funds control so much of the stock it is extremely difficult to oust an entire board no matter how strongly a large number of shareholders feel about the boards previous actions
202983 realizing i could not gain control i saw no point in spending the final two weeks in a debilitating fight when little would be accomplished except to build animosity between both camps
202984 as the pressure increases on traditional media companies its a great opportunity for us
202985 we definitely have a very strong point of view of how to shore up your traditional business but also expand online weve shown success increasing page views and driving traffic
202986 a lot of them are doing the right things and were helping them along that path were helping them with the jump from old media to new media
202987 weve had a canadian media company come and talk to us and say we want to build our web revenue from 20 million to 100 million those are the sort of questions were getting
202988 brought a different level of access that we didnt have before
202989 chinas semiconductor industry now is undergoing a transformation with an increased focus on designing chips for electronic products that are popular in the nation
202990 in the electronics industry china often is seen simply as a low cost manufacturing region
202991 however the rise of the semiconductor design business in china shows that the nations high tech future increasingly will reside in capitalizing on local brainpower to produce innovative products that appeal to the domestic audience
202992 a full service law firm uniquely positioned to provide strategic intellectual property corporate financing and litigation services
202993 located in the heart of silicon valleys technology and venture capital community
202994 we have not announced that we are going to be selling an mp3 player
202995 we are looking into the possibility of coming up with different content avenues that can be shared across multiple devices built by dell
202996 that is something unique thats not fully offered in the marketplace right now
202997 i understand theres skepticism based on the history but i believe the fans will see very quickly that this isnt the same old story weve made trades here based on sound baseball judgment and building a championship caliber organization not for financial reasons and were confident people will see that
202998 we have good visibility and a strong pipeline coming into the quarter
202999 theres an appetite for security and storage under one roof symantec is benefiting from that dynamic
203000 i think that provides a degree of insulation for us from broad macroeconomic slowdowns
203001 that said we are not immune perhaps a little better insulated than most

203015 the success of earlier garda and rsa campaigns this year during the st patricks day and may day bank holiday weekends show the positive results that can be achieved with high levels of enforcement of road safety law

203023 with this new record it basically summarizes everything we feel weve done right as a band that we feel are key ingredients of trivium all rolled into one with a new direction on top of it
203024 so it does have a little bit of everything weve done and some more it has as much singing on it as 2006s
203025 with the crusade we were done with screaming done with bands that did it done with doing it ourselves
203026 we just didnt want to do it anymore but when we started jamming for shogun and we heard how brutal and heavy some of the stuff was its the heaviest sh weve ever done before we tried singing over it and it wasnt right what was it missing the screaming and thats exactly what it needed

203029 but i cant say specifically which budgets will be affected
203030 almost half of the cost goes to the salary of the teacher who is involved in the case
203031 the school also has to pay for a substitute teacher and of course the legal expenses themselves
203032 i was kind of low on the depth chart but things worked themselves out
203033 i think my performance was something to build on it gave me a foundation to go into the offseason and have a more positive mentality
203034 jabari has been in our system so he knows what it takes to play
203035 leodis has the physical skills he just has to understand what it takes to play in this league and the adjustments that need to be made
203036 not only are you losing teammates you are losing good friends
203037 you are losing guys in the locker room guys you grow with seeing one of your good friends go down with an injury it not only puts a damper on your roster it also hurts you as a man
203038 it could have been difficult but i had great veterans in front of me
203039 they would take me under their wing and teach me so much i feel fortunate that i got to play under those guys
203040 he just needed that opportunity he needed to be able to play and prove himself and if you watched him each training camp he was making plays
203041 at this stage we wanted to bring in someone who can make an impact and i am sure tom will grasp this opportunity
203042 james has been in great form this summer but has unfortunately suffered a broken finger which will sideline him for a while
203043 tom is a talented young player who has had a good amount of first team cricket and is a very capable batsman
203044 absolutely ready to be picked for the first test against new zealand
203045 he has a reputation with various managers for not being a team man
203046 he appears to prefer to face test fast bowling from somewhere next to the square leg umpire
203047 add to this his unwillingness to take on difficult catches between him and first slip lest he be accused of dropping anything
203048 without any potential batting all rounders to provide a quality fifth bowling option it is vital that the wicket keeper is a quality batsman
203049 bell gets out for less than 10 a third of the time id be surprised if thats not fairly normal

203064 women care more about their homes because it is a reflection of who they are
203065 my mother called me and told me she couldnt come over anymore to my home because of the mess
203066 i told her that was fine because i wasnt going to clean anymore so she wouldnt come over
203067 boy was that a mistake i missed out on some wonderful time with my mom because i was bullheaded
203068 she started yelling for me frantically she thought that the house had been ransacked there were toys and laundry and newspapers all over the place the breakfast dishes were on the table and the place was a mess
203069 she spent the rest of the week wondering out loud if she was the only one who thought baking soda was an inappropriate addition to my loads of laundry or whether anyone else could see the streaks on the bathroom mirror

203121 it is becoming increasingly hard for americans to find work in this economy
203122 as the construction manufacturing and now retail sectors are reeling from job losses too many workers are being forced to reduce their hours and take part time jobs just to make ends meet
203123 i think were going to see more of the same for at least another quarter and it could be the rest of the year
203124 its good to have the government adding jobs in the short term but thats not an long term solution either
203125 if we want to create jobs we should do more to make work pay for ordinary americans not boost the profits of oil companies
203126 its time to restore fairness and balance to our economy and we can start by passing the emergency economic plan that im proposing today
203127 unlike senator obama i do not believe that raising taxes is the answer to our economic problems
203128 there is no surer way to force jobs overseas than to raise taxes on businesses the american people cannot afford economic policies that will take us backward

203144 this is the first time a congressional committee has ever passed consumer protections for credit cardholders but we are not out of the woods just yet
203145 in its current form this bill seeks to lock into law restrictions on fundamental risk management activities the way interest is calculated and other responsible business practices
203146 the result will be higher costs for consumers reduced access to credit for those with an imperfect or limited credit history and less access to low credit options
203147 ive reached the end of my freshman year at princeton which seems rather tragic for a man of my advanced years
203148 its terrible that people trying to keep peace are getting killed it showcases why they need a robust protective force there but that hasnt happened
203149 and these people who were attacked and killed had armed soldiers with them imagine those kinds of attacks on unarmed people and you have what happens in darfur all the time
203150 i was wrapped up in the glamour of it all i thought going with such prominent celebrities we were going to get some big things done we got to make our case to chinese officials and they listened politely but actually
203151 there hasnt been zero movement chinas rhetoric has changed some and they have put some engineers in sudan and provided some help to the un peacekeeping force but it is frustrating you wonder sometimes at what point does raising awareness become too little even that has its limits
203152 they called a cease fire to inoculate children so theres evidence of it working in the past
203153 if something like that could happen in darfur we could do some real good
203154 there is definitely pressure on athletes to fit in and to not upset sponsors their national team and the united states olympic committee
203155 i think the usoc has used the propaganda language as sort of a blunt instrument to blunt any criticism
203156 were not telling athletes what they should or shouldnt say we happen to think that staying positive in focus is just a better way to do business we support athletes staying focused on the hundreds of thousands of people being hurt
203157 guys interested in dumb girls jewelry and the advancement of their own careers
203158 theres a time and place for the issues and causes the olympic games and politics dont go together well
203159 everything that was being written about me was like oh what a great guy i was proud of that but what was absolutely crucial i started saying was that what the kids in darfur really need is not being shot not having their houses burned down and their sisters and mothers being raped thats when the tone of reporting on me changed there was an attitude of now youre talking about politics who are you to be telling us about politics one columnist really savaged me saying i have more muscle than brains after some shell shock and reflection i realized that they werent attacking the argument they were attacking me and that was an education
203160 these people have been driven out of their homes theyre basically just squatting there making do as best they can these camps are huge 40 000 or 50 000 people and theyre getting some food and a little space to sleep in but theres nothing to do and nowhere they can go
203161 growing up an american you think that if you have any trouble you can always go home and your family will feed you or that you can move somewhere and start over but these people cant go anywhere as americans we dont think about being in those circumstances i walked away feeling like there was a rock in the pit of my stomach

203174 the patients and their families are anxious concerned distressed and on edge
203175 i thought it was important to brighten the days of the patients and their families with something other than reruns of the oprah show and soap operas droning on the television
203176 we also discussed the benefits of a person playing rather than an electronic player
203177 i wanted to convey to the patient that someone cares enough about you that they are coming in person to play for you
203178 i play broadway show tunes and offer the staff a chance to play name that tune
203179 i told the patient that i had a day job and was not the regular piano player
203180 when i start playing i can feel the mood change
203181 they want to hear something that makes them feel good
203182 the music really helps make the waiting room a relaxing and soothing environment for them
203183 i just enjoy playing the piano and being around people

203188 esta nueva bancada es la secuela l gica de un maretazo propiciado por el aprismo para fomentar el transfuguismo esto debilita al congreso en sus roles de control pol tico y fiscalizaci n
203189 que ahora tienen como mira el a o 2011 es innegable que hay entendimientos bajo la mesa entre solidaridad nacional y el partido aprista o entre sus cabezas es innegable
203190 yo creo continu que el presidente garc a tiene genuina preocupaci n por el 2011 y que el partido o candidato antisistema pueda tener xito l garc a p rez necesita un presidente intermedio del 2011 al 2016 que no le malogre las cosas
203191 he escuchado decir al se or bedoya que la culpa de que su partido no se cohesione es del apra ahora resulta que los apristas tenemos que defender al ppc para que no se caiga y d nde est la responsabilidad de l como dirigente
203192 son personas muy serias con los que podemos conversar no es una bancada que nosotros vayamos a dirigir ojal se establezca una gran alianza porque lo que buscamos es que haya institucionalidad en el congreso

203206 mi llegada aqu estuvo acompa ada de muchas irregularidades dr sticas
203207 la primera irregularidad que mencionar es la caza de brujas de los medios que comenz en los medios musulmanes a n antes del inicio del conflicto armado y que me proclam como un criminal de guerra en un momento en que las nicas v ctimas eran serbias
203208 es una verg enza para los santafesinos tener esta constituci n

203210 no tiene que ser necesariamente mayor el presupuesto tiene que ser ajustado a la eficiencia del gasto en cada regi n pero recorte no va a haber

203213 the executives current claim of absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without any support in the case law
203214 resume their discourse and negotiations in an effort to resolve their differences constructively while recognizing each branchs essential role
203215 thus we sometimes see a petitioner in a reply brief abandoning weak arguments
203216 or attempting to answer for the first time the most difficult arguments against her position
203217 could save a lot of time and the cost to their clients by not preparing a reply brief
203218 a properly drafted reply brief can offer insight into the issues most in contention between the parties
203219 regrettably replies are frequently ill conceived and simply reargue the opening brief
203220 perhaps this is done in the hope that what is read last makes the lasting impression
203221 these types of reply briefs do make an impression but an unfavorable one
203222 positions are staked out in the opening and response briefs
203223 and one would start consideration of the legal issues and modify ones tentative conclusion based on the reply brief
203224 my experience is that the supreme court is very very liberal at granting requests for more words
203225 but one sentiment among appellate lawyers is why should we invite all these requests just double the number of words
203226 this helps narrow the issues for me before i read appellants brief
203227 theres nothing more frustrating than spending a lot of time struggling with something in appellants brief only to find respondent concedes it or attacks it on a completely different basis than the one anticipated by the appellant
203228 appellant may abandon something he spent 20 pages on in opening brief after hearing respondents reply or may have a devastating comeback or devastating lack of a comeback to something respondent says
203229 the reply brief to me was the most important document in the process
203230 its the appellants last attempt to show why notwithstanding what the respondent says the appellant should win
203231 they are not only your best opportunity to convince the court of the bankruptcy of your adversarys arguments they may also be your only opportunity given the limited time available for oral argument
203232 it gives you a clue its not a strong case
203233 would you ever want to give your opponent the last word before oral argument

203315 the two percentage point gap is insignificant in a poll with a margin of error of plus or minus 2 8 percentage points the obama mccain contest is essentially unchanged from the previous poll released june 18 obama lost a point and mccain gained a point

203431 you can set up the cluster to be like a ferrari with 10 gigabit ethernet or infiniband connections or you can do what weve done so far and set up something more like a honda with gigabit ethernet
203432 thats about as bulletproof as you can get for the price point and flexibility
203433 if we expand more we are going to have to put external storage behind the seanodes cluster
203434 but seanodes will still save us by letting us use jbods behind each cluster node rather than more expensive raid arrays

203443 we believe that our data add to those from previous studies showing a causal relationship between h pylori infection and gastric cancer and also support the use of h pylori eradication to prevent the development of gastric cancer
203444 the results are clear in a high risk population gastric cancer rates are substantially reduced but not abolished by h pylori eradication why some patients still development metachronous cancer despite eradication remains unknown but genomic targeting might help tailor individual treatment in the future
203445 yet worldwide gastric cancer kills more people and there is better evidence that h pylori eradication can prevent mortality than there is for colonoscopy screening
203446 preventing gastric cancer by eradicating h pylori in high risk regions should be a priority

203463 he said he felt a connection in his heart and heard directions in his mind
203464 the compelling argument is this the country is in a mess and what we need is really good candidates to step forward
203465 if the country wasnt in a crisis i think i would not blink an eye in deciding against running for senate but i think building a stronger majority in the senate is a real priority at this time
203466 this should be about getting the best candidates who can run strong races and win the senate seat for new mexico so we can be part of the change thats going to happen in 2009

203472 it will be good for inflation but will only be reflected in late augusts inflation numbers it will decrease the transport category within the inflation basket thats mainly due to the oil price decreases
203473 irans test salvo of ballistic missiles last week together with recent threatening rhetoric by commanders of the islamic republics revolutionary guards emphasizes how close the middle east is to a fundamental in fact an irreversible turning point the regime is buying the short additional period of time it needs to produce deliverable nuclear weapons the strategic objective it has been pursuing clandestinely for 20 years between iran and its long sought objective however a showdown may fall targeted military action either israeli or american rather the crucial turning point is when iran masters all the capabilities to weaponize without further external possibility of stopping it then the decision to weaponize and its timing is tehrans alone all we do know is that after five years of failed diplomacy by the eu 3 britain france and germany iran is simply five years closer to nuclear weapons and yet true to form state department comments to congress last week even as irans missiles were ascending downplayed irans nuclear progress ignoring the cost of failed diplomacy that is why israel is now at an urgent decision point whether to use targeted military force to break irans indigenous control over the nuclear fuel cycle at one or more critical points if sucessful such highly risky and deeply unattracive air strikes or sabotage will not resolve the iranian nuclear crisis but the urgency of the situation has not impressed barack obama or the eu 3 remarkably on july 9 sen obama as if stumbling on a new idea said iran must suffer threats of economic sanctions and that we needed direct diplomacy so we avoid provocation and give strong incentives to change their behavior
203474 to make an argument that the u s should support israel in a bombing mission to iran is tantamount to saying the u s should undertake the mission itself however given that iran is on a path to becoming the eventual regional hegemonic state a prospect that acutely concentrates the minds of all of its neighbors why not draw on the training and investment the u s has made in its other ally in the region saudi arabia to join in a joint strike on iran nuclear facilities or just let the saudis do it
203475 yes the economys been slowing for some time but its really only in the past week that the markets started to price easings in over the next six months
203476 now that its being recognised as a real and imminent prospect this is weighing on the australian dollar
203477 the aussie is seen as a commodity currency it is seen as having a big yield advantage to the us and both those advantages have been eroded
203478 we clearly are operating in challenging economic times some of the markets are deteriorating generally
203479 well develop our strategies going forward over the next couple of months
203480 obviously we need to take a view as to what theyre saying about us and take some of that feedback on board
203481 if you are asking if the two are linked the answer is definitely no
203482 i have enjoyed my time as managing director and i am proud of the achievements my team and i have made
203483 under the act the director of liquor licensing can impose conditions on a licence this condition requires that employees are not to be dressed immodestly
203484 it is important to note where the standard entertainment conditions are imposed the minimum clothing a person selling or serving alcohol can wear is a bikini that does not expose the breast nor buttocks
203485 g strings nipple stickers and see through clothing including crocheted bikinis are considered to be immodest and are not acceptable as a minimum dress standard for those people who sell or serve liquor
203486 i mean i went through on the weekend and looked at our catalogues and i thought wow thats cheap
203487 like tvs and fridges and washers and that like were selling them at a lower price than we were 10 years ago its just so cheap and so theres no point in fixing the old one just get a new one throw the old one away
203488 one of our concerns in terms of third party rail access is what happens if something goes wrong with the third partys rail car on our line
203489 the negative outlook reflects both the potential impact of weaker credit conditions in nabs core geographies as well as ongoing discussions in credit markets
203490 were really working on it and there are lots of things happening
203491 the aim is to be global but the source of the knowledge comes from china
203492 looking for exotic herbal ingredients to make a completely new drink and sort of revolutionise the whole soft drink industry
203493 generally speaking we want to create drinks that relieve fatigue and help the body fight off diseases
203494 coke executives all hope to develop a chinese medicine based beverage quickly
203495 adequate insurance is important like this people get injured at work and need cover income protection for example
203496 people have massive mortgages and need protection against illness and trauma to rely on the state to help you just isnt an economic proposition
203497 the first proposition is that australians are massively under life insured
203498 the second proposition is that we the industry have been in a state of slumberland in terms of addressing this issue
203499 the third proposition is that primarily this is an industry problem not a government problem
203500 and the fourth proposition is that we can only fix this with a co ordinated approach which mainly comes from the industry but which will be helped by regulators and government
203501 the advent of the superannuation guarantee and default life insurance cover has massively cut into the market but equally it needs to be said that the industry superannuation funds have done a great job in getting better cover and in recent times have gone for deeper cover to their credit
203502 secondly regulation has regulated life insurance out of the market to some extent but it has equally helped to protect people from excessive sales practices
203503 there should not be a debate about commission on life insurance
203504 its the premium and the cover that are the critical things
203505 and the third point is to simplify it and thats something that has still got a long way to go
203506 how does the average person know what morbidity is or mortality or trauma the terms need to be more consumer friendly
203507 but another point about the industry is that for the first time ever it has banded together and thats critical to this campaign
203508 the key message is that individuals do have this massive protection gap but its not hard to bridge that gap there are simple ways and means to bridge the gap
203509 uncertainty and fear do mean that people start to look for safe havens
203510 we do not have any extant submissions in to government for tax relief except for state stamp duty
203511 life insurance state stamp duty is for customers premiums significant but for the industry and for state revenue its a nuisance tax
203512 but the fact that their global marketing chief david wheldon is coming out here next week suggests to me that they are just going to fire them stw
203513 we are investing huge amounts of money on behalf of our customers
203514 we have to fund that through debt and equity and we need support from both that is how a market economy works
203515 the economy more generally is feeling the ongoing impacts of the reserve banks tightening of monetary policy as well as market based rate rises
203516 inventories were run down significantly suggesting continuing weaker demand and the potential for further falls in production
203517 the pressures flowing from slower market growth rising input costs and the ongoing strength in the australian dollar are a mix of both cyclical and long term factors affecting profit margins
203518 it could be quite an opportune time for stephen tindall to come out with a privatisation plan and literally offer something on the table and take the stock off their hands thats an extra 20 per cent that sits alongside his 50 odd per cent and then its not so much of stretch to get to the compulsory acquirement level
203519 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
203520 the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
203521 dear future millionaire ten years ago the hedge fund managers at gryphon financial commissioned mits brightest genetic scientist and computer programmer to create a system of market analysis and prediction this group of men masters of their trades locked themselves in a room dedicated to create the most innovative trading system known to man our scientists have managed to find an underlying genetic code within publicly traded companies these geniuses have compiled a collection of data drawn from over the past 100 years with that data an encryption code outputs a collection of bona fide winners

203525 the result of an extraordinary state of affairs in the world financial system
203526 we again flag the potentially precarious balance sheet and banking covenants poor operational performance or further write downs could feasibly put abc at risk
203527 the accounts of abc are not transparent and abcs behaviour suggests that it remains under pressure from its banks to repay debt
203528 they have to do clean energy because they cant just do more and more dirty energy
203529 were seeing china as being a no 1 2 or 3 player in lots of different sectors in this industry
203530 they know the impact of the issue not only to the world but to china
203531 the system in china compared to many other countries seems to be more effective
203532 basically if the top leadership in beijing decides to drive this kind of effort they really get things done
203533 there isnt the same economic penalty today to implement wind
203534 there seems to be a sentiment around property and property exposure which is causing these issues
203535 the lack of confidence is a little endemic and it is running across the market
203536 confident that it would be a lot more than 80c in the dollar

203543 the practice in stapled securities since 1999 2000 was to chase ever increasing distributions
203544 the reality has been that the sector has evolved over the last several years and those traditional defensive characteristics have been diluted in the pursuit of higher earnings growth
203545 reading notes in the financial statement can be somewhat amusing with investments in forestry tourism debt toll roads airports and really anything that remotely resembles real estate
203546 paying in excess of cash flow essentially you are relying on assets appreciating over time in order to afford that
203547 in an environment where asset values come under pressure and availability of capital diminishes youre in a tough position
203548 returns to investors are enhanced through the use of higher financial leverage
203549 the proposed investments to be undertaken by the joint venture represent a lower quality of assets than gpts current high quality portfolio
203550 we seriously question the total returns gpt unit holders will receive when you consider the capital growth prospects of these properties
203551 up until the middle of last year i think the joint venture was valued by the market
203552 listed property trusts have evolved to deliver higher earnings growth and created a range of different models higher growth comes with higher volatility and risk thats the way it happens
203553 there was a belief and indeed a desire for investors in australia to access other markets around the world through local managers if there wasnt no one would have raised a dollar
203554 built to last until the next cycle when we will energetically move to unwind what are now untenable positions with as little bloodshed as possible
203555 i dont believe any business can truly say you can withstand cycles you look at every listed entity in australia cycles do impact businesses
203556 around the time the real estate market peaked you may have heard that us real estate prices particularly for residential properties have declined a bit since then
203557 reporting season is going to be ugly more from the point of how its going to affect investor sentiment
203558 i think a lot of trusts are going to have to wind back distributions thats not news the lives they were leading were unsustainable
203559 theres no doubt the sector has lost the confidence of its investment market particularly for its defensive characteristics
203560 im not convinced that its just going back to what they were 10 years ago
203561 people will hold property in a listed or unlisted form for as long as the world exists in my opinion
203562 we develop a product for children who are physically or mentally challenged in some way
203563 to get them to interact with some toys that would not normally be designed for them
203564 a lot of the toys are ones that have a little micro switch where the kids do not have the dexterity to manipulate it

203566 it started as a really nice way to have campers come up with a project idea
203567 every time they clicked it the frog would start dancing
203568 it made me think not to take advantage of the little things you can do
203569 it is being able to interact and treat them like any kid
203570 the design campers were egging them on and we were the targets

203606 it is perhaps fitting that the weight fell on sullivan as chief scout his recommendations weighed heavily in the draft selections this can be interpreted as his punishment
203607 the old stomach was all buggered up i wasnt eating and sleeping properly and at my age that isnt good
203608 and since im the reason things are the way they are i had to go down to the bench and try to do something about it its obvious its going to take more than coaching
203609 id rather find out that my wife was cheating on me than to have to keep losing like this
203610 at least i could tell my wife to cut it out
203611 the improvement of the team had not measured up to expectations
203612 management is very disappointed with the progress of the washington capitals so far this season and has therefore decided a coaching change was necessary
203613 we are very excited about the launch of the new ka
203614 the original has been a huge hit in the uk with a sales record of over 480 000 80 per cent of which have been to retail customers and many of those first time buyers im confident that the latest design will prove just as big a hit
203615 youve been tricked i told you it was a hoax
203616 you shall not doubt of me at all keep trusting on me and soon ill answer
203617 he was then attacked by both men one attempting to restrain him around the neck and face with his own seat belt followed by the other striking him in the face
203618 a broken air conditioner a problem with the fuel tanks that led to an aborted take off a shattered cockpit window involving a small fire and a broken fuel valve
203619 these are not comprehensive or full scope safeguards unlike with nuclear proliferation treaty member states but it the agreement satisfies indias needs while maintaining all the agencys legal requirements
203620 the conditions in hong kong are very challenging because of the humidity
203621 and although horses and people can acclimate to heat no one has ever demonstrated that theres any way to acclimate to humidity this is an extremely challenging environment
203622 before the atlanta olympics there was a lot of concern about whether it would be so hot that the horses wouldnt be able to compete safely
203623 we had a protocol for sampling the horses and monitoring them and all the international researchers participated by making their data available to ohio state for analysis
203624 the facilities are so good that our research was able to convince people to go who otherwise wouldnt have gone
203625 and theres no question that it will be challenging and thats partly why im going because i have experience and have helped troubleshoot in these areas
203626 on expectations that the surge in energy prices is depressing u s gasoline demand
203627 todays financial news provides an independent and practical perspective on the us and global investment markets containing commentary interviews and recommendations it helps you make the right financial decisions
203628 once again it sure looks like the markets took the bait hook line and sinker yesterday
203629 again though i just have to believe this is a bear trap and one that will take no prisoners once it gets sprung
203630 our judgment is that the weakness in the economy will be sufficient to bring inflation and inflation expectations down over the medium term
203631 we have thus adopted an easing bias in our monetary policy
203632 robbie really wanted to come to us and you can already see he is going to bring us an enormous amount hard work goals and experience
203633 he will bring the level of the team up a notch
203634 keane has a proven record and great mobility and versatility he can play on the wing or a bit behind the striker
203635 it is very good for the team to have a player who can get in between the oppositions midfield and defence and score goals
203636 the tactical lay out of the team and whether or not we are going to play two up front is down to rafa benitez
203637 when he signed keane im sure he had a very clear idea of where he wanted to play him
203638 but he is very adaptable he could fill a number of different roles
203639 hopefully its a signing that will excite our fans some of the lads have watched him on youtube and he looks different class
203640 getting him here excites me and shows the kind of football im looking to play at blackburn
203641 i think in football there is too much modern slavery transferring players or buying players here and there and putting them somewhere
203642 we are trying now to intervene in such cases if the player wants to play somewhere else then a solution should be found
203643 what i said is slavery is with the young people youngsters that european clubs are trying to get and bring them to the big clubs this is my expression this is modern slavery
203644 i have never mentioned that for ronaldo but the press have distorted it ronaldo is not a slave
203645 the higher cost of crude oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price of gasoline and other refined products
203646 as a result our downstream operations incurred a loss in the second quarter with most of the loss taking place in the united states
203647 a bear dragged the man for about 5 6 metres towards the forest and tried to bury him it didnt succeed so it abandoned him there
203648 a bear dragged the man for about 5 6 metres towards the forest and tried to bury him it didn amp squo t succeed so it abandoned him there
203649 over half a million hectares of forests in cameroon has been certified and about 1 2 million hectares are in the process of certification
203650 one million hectares of congo basin forests have achieved certification under the worlds leading sustainable forestry scheme
203651 with rampant illegal logging vague logging concession boundaries and massive blocks of pristine forest destined for the chainsaw this is a laudable step towards avoiding an ecological disaster
203652 undercuts the efforts of companies trying to do sustainable exploitation
203653 certification is good even if cameroons forest law may need to be reviewed to allow locals who own mainly small exploitation titles the chance to group and get certification

203659 you are unhappy when the federal reserve creates new money and credit which increases the money supply which increases consumer prices and aggregate debt and that is why you say you drink and come in here to torment the waitresses with your stupid leer and crude innuendo and now you are unhappy when the fed doesnt increase money and credit and that is why you are drinking
203660 my brother is a chemist for a worldwide company he told me yesterday that dow chemical one of his biggest suppliers raised prices by 20 three months ago and now just announced another 25 price hike
203661 lets get naked and really monkey love nasty because it is the only thing we will have left after the federal reserve has finished destroying us by creating too much money and credit aided and abetted by a corrupt craven congress that wanted to borrow and spend hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars a year every year now amounting to a debt of over 9 5 trillion spending us into a debtors grave and we racked up a trade deficit of 800 billion a year too do wah diddy diddy
203662 this is the third time in the last month that you came home late stinking with the stench of whatever gutter in which you were wallowing

203664 while all agencies have initiated efforts to deploy encryption technologies none had documented comprehensive plans to guide encryption implementation activities such as installing and configuring appropriate technologies in accordance with federal guidelines developing and documenting policies and procedures for managing encryption technologies and training users
203665 what has occurred today is clearly a tragic accident and although all rescue resources responded quickly and worked hard to save this mans life he was sadly pronounced deceased later at hospital
203666 in this case a member of the public whose home overlooked the river sighted the upturned skiff and was absolutely right to dial 999
203667 these are businesspeople who are often part of organized crime groups that have their own supply chains
203668 it generally takes less than four hours for stolen cargo to leave the state where the theft occurred and everything from scheduling the hit and negotiating the sale price of the goods to the choice of export conveyance has already been arranged
203669 the goal of our systems is to take the technology beyond simple gps tracking we want to relieve fleet managers of the burden of continuously monitoring their fleets and enable them to optimize the security safety and efficiency of their assets
203670 if you get compliance theres less of a chance for theft
203671 i had one customer tell me that the trucking companies cant lie to me anymore
203672 but users have been too busy figuring out the technologys economics and its effect on business processes to concentrate on the security of the tag itself
203673 technology must always be supported by appropriate policies procedures and trained personnel
203674 most end users will not know what they are buying
203675 technology definitely has its place but the best theft deterrent is common sense
203676 overall lead acid batteries cost per kilowatt makes them the lowest priced form of energy available for lift trucks
203677 we see automation playing an increasing role in battery changing
203678 the biggest commodity problem facing the industry will soon be a shortage of employees with the right skill sets
203679 were going from a people looking for jobs economy to a jobs looking for people economy
203680 the advent of operation embedded charging has shifted the accountability of battery management from people to the chargers themselves
203681 the best of these chargers are intelligent rather than just fast because a high current charge without sophisticated controllers will result in damaged batteries and compromised run time
203682 these new products are what we call global in design they fit lots of different kinds of equipment used all over the world
203683 the benefits of this system are labor savings reduced equipment damage and improved battery efficiency
203684 tppl offers great energy densities accepts higher recharge rates and could make an enormous impact in the future
203685 we didnt want to put the manhattan wms into legacy sites that would be retiring as part of the dc network redesign
203686 at any one point in time the manhattan wms has to manage 11 to 13 product categories that have to come together at a single point in time to load the truck
203687 its merging all these types of streams of product together
203688 the manhattan system must control the product over a network rather than just a single dc
203689 it has to know how to allocate the stock across our store base
203690 when you have 120 people on a shift with 120 people coming in and another 120 going out you lose 10 minutes per person at change over time that adds up to a lot of minutes
203691 costs were up for virtually every component of business logistics
203692 but in my opinion neither have we entered a recovery
203693 i reject the idea that this is a frightening time there have been few times that it has been more exciting to be in the transportation business
203694 in talking to my colleagues we have a much brighter outlook
203695 our supply chain is built around a cost service proposition and speed is a very important part of that proposition
203696 make some paradigm changing decisions about what the service model ought to be and what the speed model ought to be

203702 with the first round of the governments economic stimulus checks having been mailed in early may one would have hoped they would have bolstered online spending in may and june
203703 however recent comscore research reveals that fully two thirds of consumers said they had not planned to spend their stimulus checks and rather intended to use the cash to pay off debt or put the money into savings i ts likely the impact of the stimulus may have been felt more offline where a variety of merchants made it particularly easy for consumers to cash their checks at retail stores
203704 after the semi final in the changing rooms we said lets keep our foot down now
203705 were at wembley now lets forget about that and concentrate on securing that top spot in super league
203706 you cant look past the next team because every team has strength in the super league
203707 you have to go and perform or we could undo the good work we have done in catching leeds

203713 adam felt it was in his best interest and the phillies best interest to re establish himself as a guy who could start and he wasnt going to do that with the phillies i think he can do that and will do that i think adam thinks he would be in the phillies rotation next year but he knows he has to prove himself to the manager and the organization the best place for him to do what he needs to do is the minors
203714 it is confusing for patients who really are stuck in the middle of this argument with some clinicians and clinics offering treatments like reproductive immune therapy and pre implantation genetic screening pgs and others coming down firmly against the procedures there needs to be more clinical trials to establish whether or not these interventions are of benefit
203715 eligibility criteria varies across the uk as does access to treatment creating this treatment by postcode which is totally unacceptable infertility network uk always encourages those who contact us to try and adopt a healthy lifestyle when trying to conceive however we believe lifestyle issues should be a matter for discussion between the patient and clinician lifestyle criteria should not be used as an out and out barrier to treatment
203716 very importantly the majority of health professionals who responded believe that funded ivf should be offered as part of national healthcare systems it is almost pointless to discuss criteria when in reality the vast majority of couples in england are being denied access to treatment at all infertility network uk as part of the national infertility awareness campaign have campaigned for many years for a fair and equitable service for fertility patients and will continue to do so till we see an end to the postcode lottery which exists today

203727 hes got a dog a doberman pinscher named belle every day he takes belle for a walk in the morning and nearly every morning his neighbor leans out her window or peeks out her door and yells at him shes convinced that his dog is pooping on her lawn now i know my son in law he may not be much of a husband but he takes better care of that dog than he does himself and he always has a plastic bag or three with him to pick up after her
203728 last weekend dave had just about had enough of his neighbor for one lifetime so he figures hes going to do something about it he gets up at about four a m and goes to the kitchen for a jar of skippy out he creeps onto her lawn and leaves a big dollop of peanut butter on the grass then goes back to bed
203729 at his usual time dave takes belle out for a walk and deliberately cuts across his neighbors lawn which brings her out on the front porch shouting at him that his dog left another mess in her yard
203730 dave says the neighbor hasnt so much as looked at him since

203737 we are committed to help make health insurance more affordable
203738 the question on my mind is how much of this billion dollars that youre going to save over the six years is going to go into reserves and how much is going to go to reduce premiums
203739 i think if you talk about reduced premiums you have a much more attractive proposition

203749 cest ladversaire le plus difficile qui pouvait nous tre oppos mais je pense que les dirigeants de latletico aussi esp raient un autre tirage cest le genre dopposition quon peut voir normalement en 8e de finale ou en quart de finale de la c1 nous voulons absolument atteindre la phase de poules de la ligue des champions je ne pense pas quil y ait de favoris cest plut t du 50 50
203750 en ligue des champions il ny a jamais de match facile mais nous avons montr la saison derni re quart de finaliste limin par barcelone ndlr que nous pouvions nous exprimer dans la comp tition la plus difficile du football europ en
203751 cest un rival dur les allemands sont forts mais cest un rival de notre niveau
203752 javais peur car la fin du tirage il restait encore galatasaray mais je crois que nous avons un adversaire si cest brann bergen qui est quand m me champion de norv ge ce ne sera pas un match facile mais je pr f re la norv ge ce sera un tour difficile car en france peu de gens connaissent le football norv gien il ne faut pas oublier que cest un football bien structur avec une grande discipline comme le jeu anglais ils jouent comme beaucoup d quipes en france avec un syst me trois attaquants trois milieux et quatre d fenseurs ce ne sera pas vident mais cela aurait pu tre pire

203760 the good news is that there are fewer countries now than was the case 60 years ago but there are still too many
203761 there are still countries that hold prisoners who have done nothing other than to exercise their god given and internationally recognized rights
203762 we ought to promise to make the release of such prisoners a major priority of our bilateral relationships with countries that still do this

203771 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
203772 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
203773 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

203777 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

203788 we know that many patients choose not to complete their course of medication but this study reveals a different type of problem patients who for whatever reason take their medicines incorrectly
203789 our pharmacists have reported many instances where patients have been confused by their medicines
203790 one patient set out a range of medicines and described the frequency and dosage for each
203791 it turns out that for several months she had been taking a sleeping pill first thing in the morning
203792 when the pharmacist asked him to demonstrate the problem became clear he wasnt removing the cap

203802 despite our findings and even though immune responses are known to decline with age i still want my grandmother to keep getting the flu vaccine
203803 it is safe so it is worth getting even if it might lower the risk of pneumonia and death only slightly
203804 this paper does not negate the need for influenza vaccine
203805 other studies that were specifically designed to address this question have shown benefits from vaccination in reducing both infection and subsequent morbidity and mortality in the elderly
203806 anyone over the age of 65 or who falls into an at risk group including those with heart problems diabetes or asthma should always make sure they are vaccinated every year
203807 it gave me headaches i found it so uncomfortable to sleep then two of my extensions came out and took my own hair with it
203808 it was really uncomfortable and sore i had little broken bits of hair all over my head and little tufts coming out
203809 traction alopecia is what its called where the whole hair shaft has been pulled out its major damage to a very delicate structure
203810 you may get away with having your hair pulled out that way a few times but eventually the follicle will shut down

203813 we are definitely seeing a rise in the number of young girls who have experimented with cheap do it yourself extensions that have damaged their hair and who come to racoon salons to sort out the mess

203821 we know that many patients choose not to complete their course of medication but this study reveals a different type of problem patients who for whatever reason take their medicines incorrectly
203822 our pharmacists have reported many instances where patients have been confused by their medicines
203823 one patient set out a range of medicines and described the frequency and dosage for each
203824 it turns out that for several months she had been taking a sleeping pill first thing in the morning
203825 when the pharmacist asked him to demonstrate the problem became clear he wasnt removing the cap
203826 despite our findings and even though immune responses are known to decline with age i still want my grandmother to keep getting the flu vaccine
203827 it is safe so it is worth getting even if it might lower the risk of pneumonia and death only slightly
203828 this paper does not negate the need for influenza vaccine
203829 other studies that were specifically designed to address this question have shown benefits from vaccination in reducing both infection and subsequent morbidity and mortality in the elderly

203863 residents were at less risk of being obese or overweight if they lived in walkable neighborhoods those that are more densely populated designed to be more friendly to pedestrians and have a range of destinations for pedestrians
203864 older neighborhoods often have bundles of design features such as tree shaded sidewalks convenient small shops bus stops places to work and attractive destinations that give residents a reason to walk
203865 starting in the 1950s we went away from the concept of walkable communities we have to go back to where we were and create a model to building where you can live work and recreate all within the same community

203885 people are always rushing in this city it is terrible i am from greenland and we have a population of only 56 000 people there is so much stress in this city i cannot handle all the stress in this city it is driving me absolutely crazy
203886 so as i was saying my bags and all of possessions were lost and at the police station i was told never to expect to see them again only now i have a problem it is unfortunate that there is no greenland embassy in paris but only in zurich but they explained to me what i have to do in order to get home see look i have it all on my mobile phone in a texto
203887 yes it is in greenlandic but look i have to take the train to brussels tonight for a flight to new york at 23h30 tomorrow i must to be in quebec then i will take the ferry from quebec to greenland but if i am not in quebec tomorrow i will miss the ferry and if i miss the ferry i will be stuck until september 16th because there wont be another before then
203888 my problem is that all the funds i have left on me is 420 euros a piddling sum a sum i gladly spend every day in greenland but then life is more expensive there we have everything imported my embassy which is only in zurich has made the arrangements for the train and flights through to quebec but they require me to pay a supplement of 680 euros for the ferry which is waiting for me in quebec however they must leave their mooring tomorrow and i need to be on that boat otherwise like i said there will be nothing else before september 16th and though my father is a rich man there are no currency transfer systems like western union in greenland

203900 this is a much broader issue that wal mart but i think the battle to engage wal mart and for them to examine their own corporate values and what their policies and approaches are to their workers and how they are going to be good corporate citizens i think is absolutely vital
203901 if costco can do that it means wal mart can do it and if wal mart does it then what were going to see is other companies recognizing that they have some obligations not only to their shareholders but also to their stakeholders and thats workers and communities in which theyre located

203936 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
203937 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
203938 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run
203939 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me
203940 the mccain campaign was compelled to respond to this outrageous attack because we will not allow john mccain to be smeared by senator obama as a racist for offering legitimate criticism
203941 we have waited for months with a sick feeling knowing this moment would come because we watched it incur with president clinton say whatever you want about president clinton his record on this issue is above reproach

203981 this years crop of peanuts has been in the ground for weeks and 2008 production contracts were signed months ago changing the loan differential formula after the peanut crop has been planted would have been detrimental for our growers domestic demand for peanuts and peanut products has increased and the federal government should allow growers to respond to this demand without interrupting current systems in place i applaud usda for recognizing the importance of maintaining the historically recognized practice of establishing loan differentials for the 2008 crop year

203983 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
203984 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
203985 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
203986 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
203987 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint

203990 schreiben sie lieber frau andris denn die leute nennen mich so
203991 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
203992 i think were doing the right thing and stirring things up doesnt add a heck of a lot
203993 i called them racist and they pointed at the doll head and laughed
203994 this isnt about a traffic ticket this is about a baby doll head
203995 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
203996 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
203997 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
203998 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
203999 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
204000 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

204002 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
204003 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

204006 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
204007 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

204009 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
204010 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
204011 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
204012 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
204013 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
204014 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
204015 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
204016 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
204017 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
204018 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
204019 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
204020 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
204021 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
204022 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
204023 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
204024 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
204025 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
204026 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
204027 we bought it to get rid of it bottom line
204028 those billboards did more damage to the community than the club did
204029 it became cold and dark and suddenly it was light again i am very happy it was worth the trip
204030 perfect storm of mistakes misjudgments and a failure of leadership
204031 we tell our thoughts like our children to put on their hats and coats before they go out
204032 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
204033 we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain who has fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
204034 weve seen this happen before and were not going to let it happen to us
204035 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
204036 were not going negative in return were refuting the charges
204037 its a great ad and everybodys talking about it and were having a great time with it
204038 we didnt draw first blood i mean this campaign has been rough and tumble since the day barack obama got his nomination and weve withered under the attacks of the obama campaign on a daily basis
204039 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders
204040 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
204041 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
204042 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
204043 i am as excited as i have ever been to lead this company
204044 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
204045 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
204046 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board

204049 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
204050 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
204051 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
204052 i am as excited as i have ever been to lead this company
204053 the military should rethink their position thats not a religion
204054 sets a dangerous precedent that could easily result in the practice of all sorts of bizarre practices being supported by the military under the rubric of religion
204055 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board
204056 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
204057 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders

204062 est ce que je peux prendre la base sam sur u
204063 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
204064 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
204065 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
204066 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
204067 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
204068 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
204069 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
204070 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
204071 e mail is used as a self validation tool by people to procrastinate and to re create activity versus productivity
204072 as people get smarter about ad networks theyre going to realize their limitations and that if you want to really make brands shine you have to do it yourself
204073 it was multiyear deal but it had clauses which we triggered
204074 we knew wed end the relationship one day but definitely not this early
204075 the response weve been getting from agencies over the last two weeks has been amazing
204076 the level of integration were pursuing is really in line with what agencies are pitching to clients
204077 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
204078 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
204079 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
204080 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
204081 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
204082 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
204083 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
204084 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
204085 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
204086 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
204087 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
204088 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
204089 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
204090 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
204091 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
204092 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
204093 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
204094 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
204095 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
204096 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
204097 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
204098 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
204099 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
204100 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
204101 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
204102 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
204103 more bluntly kilcullen who helped general david petraeus design his 2007 counterinsurgency strategy in iraq called the decision to invade iraq
204104 did not seek to clear that quote with me and i would not have approved it if he had
204105 if he had sought a formal comment i would have told him what i have said publicly before in my view the decision to invade iraq in 2003 was an extremely serious strategic error
204106 but the task of the moment is not to cry over spilt milk rather to help clean it up a task in which the surge the comprehensive counterinsurgency approach and our troops on theground are admirably succeeding
204107 david never claims to have said what you say he said i believe this is much ado about nothing as he says himself his views in general have been pretty clear
204108 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
204109 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
204110 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
204111 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
204112 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
204113 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
204114 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
204115 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
204116 who are open to doing something on the production side
204117 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
204118 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
204119 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
204120 contribute to climate and other environmental goals energy security economic development and offer opportunities for private companies to profit
204121 biofuels production can put upward pressure on food prices increase greenhouse gas emissions and exacerbate degradation of lands forests waters sources and ecosystems

204160 we were very bullish about where commodity prices would go power gas and coal
204161 those prices would increase during the second quarter and as a result we owned those commodities in the markets
204162 clearly in the merchant sector this was the big earner the big swing factor this quarter
204163 this is a company thats involved in very dynamic and complex energy markets and therefore one should expect the potential for more volatility in their results

204165 this is only the second time in the history of the games they have had a fire only competition within the games
204166 we had storms blowing through and it was raining which made it tough it was also hot but everyone did very well the good part for our guys is that we competed as individuals and then within an hour we had to compete as a team but we didnt get a lot of rest time
204167 with a run volume of around 400 responses per year it could be easy to become complacent in a relaxed island style atmosphere so the department has implemented a mandatory physical assessment for all line personnel as well as maintaining an aggressive training regimen for its personnel
204168 oh they looked great i went with my husband to the bbq that they organized there was lots of money there lots of rich people famous names yes it sure did impress me at first they spoke well everyone in suits at first you do not see the signs you dont understand that theres something psychotic in there
204169 they get everywhere and capture you in ways that you cannot see
204170 if they managed to get to my husband then they can really get to anyone
204171 to say that the chick is dead would be a huge logic leap
204172 and the parents do have wings so if something did happen to the chick they would probably fly away i havent seen any feathers blowing around no carcasses no forensic evidence to confirm that any of them are deceased
204173 i can tell you that the parents were last seen in the area the week after the nets went up
204174 the little chick apparently got to the point where it could walk and ended up following them to the shore they moved the chick in the direction of the beach or in this case the rip rap they frolicked in the nearby waters to feed their young and at some point the chick was mia
204175 if we dont see anything in another week we will probably take the netting and signs down
204176 we are hoping they may still be there that we may be looking in the wrong place but theyre not here anymore
204177 one of my guys caught a little one tossed it back into the rocks where he would be safe a big iguana caught him in mid air and ate him the spiney tails are definitely carnivorous they will eat anything including their own
204178 there were lots of people back then who had iguanas
204179 i took care of them that first day then let them loose
204180 i hear that all the time that i was the one but there was probably more than just me
204181 i have taken a lot of them off the island
204182 but on average we lose five to 15 a day that we cant retrieve this year we saw high numbers of them again for awhile when it got real warm but the animals are definitely smaller we know they had been eating gopher tortoises and eggs and they were eating anoles but now we are seeing that were getting more and more birds including some types of hawks that havent been around for awhile those hawks will sometimes eat the juvenile iguanas
204183 the hottest area for iguana activity is along the border of the two counties
204184 this time of the year its a little bit harder to find them with everything being green they tend to camouflage better and theres a lot more vegetation around too but ive noticed a lot more anoles around the island which is a great food source for our birds i also noticed some florida king snakes on the island that werent here for awhile and recently i saw a juvenile gopher tortoise the first in a long time that was the size of a tangerine
204185 we need to stay on top of them we need everyones cooperation
204186 everyone needs to understand that i like the iguanas too but our native animals are dying and there are some people out here who dont understand that and wont let me on their land to trap them
204187 you know bumps you can have them all back for 20 a piece
204188 we are required to give them 30 days to review things since they cost share in the project however at this point we are just waiting on the contractor to provide the information they need
204189 it might take another 30 days after that to get all the rock to the site
204190 unless he is faster or does things differently than what i am aware of
204191 we visited some solar panel manufacturers decided on one and he installed it
204192 the main problem i have is deciding which vehicle to take on the cart path
204193 when my mercedes lease was up i got this instead
204194 that company did a partnership with the man who created the car whose last name was schultz
204195 it goes to show you how in control all of us are by the car and oil companies
204196 im a conservative republican im not anything like i sound like sometimes but the fact is that these guys have us in control
204197 if this hadnt been composted you can imagine how tall this pile would be it just compacts down to earth again and makes an incredibly rich soil and it reduces diesel fuel use in garbage trucks
204198 people always want to talk about saving the environment but they dont do anything about it
204199 i want people to be able to see a guy who composts his own waste a garden to grow his own food so theres no trips to the grocery store who uses sun to produce electricity and when his lease was up on his mercedes he didnt go back to a 15 mile per gallon car he went to a 45 mile per gallon car
204200 in that respect the negative cash flow in the second quarter is overstated
204201 were going to get the second quarter behind us and just move ahead
204202 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations

204237 wir waren etwas berrascht wie viele kampagnen mit attachments es in letzter zeit gegeben hat
204238 die olympia organisatoren haben immer hart darauf bestanden dass die rund 20 000 ausl ndischen journalisten die ber die athletischen wettbewerbe in peking berichten einen uneingeschr nkten zugang zum internet zur verf gung haben

204242 die chinesische regierung ist in ihrem zensur wahn nicht zu stoppen
204243 es wird eine kritiklose berichterstattung aus einem land erwartet auf das die ganze welt schaut

204254 derartige klauseln sind grunds tzlich unwirksam und haben eine gute chance vor gericht gekippt zu werden
204255 keine grundgeb hr hei t keine nutzungsunabh ngigen kosten solch irref hrende angaben sind nach geltendem wettbewerbsrecht nicht akzeptabel

204389 mi llegada aqu estuvo acompa ada de muchas irregularidades dr sticas
204390 la primera irregularidad que mencionar es la caza de brujas de los medios que comenz en los medios musulmanes a n antes del inicio del conflicto armado y que me proclam como un criminal de guerra en un momento en que las nicas v ctimas eran serbias
204391 hay un di logo y una negociaci n y esperamos que en un breve plazo de tiempo se pueda producir un acuerdo entre el gobierno de venezuela y el banco santander
204392 la comisi n de coordinaci n del coi y el bocog se reunieron y se pusieron de acuerdo el uso de internet ser como en cualquier otro juego
204393 esto le va a restar un poco de atractivo a este tipo de instrumentos
204394 despu s del enorme auge que ha tenido esta herramienta de cr dito tras la crisis de 2001 y de que mejoraran la tasas despu s de que se terminara el conflicto entre el gobierno y el campo esto puede desalentar levemente su uso
204395 ahora va a ser m s dif cil colocar un fideicomiso
204396 puede ser que quieran pegarle a algunos que inviertan en el campo usando estos instrumentos
204397 es un instrumento muy bueno y que da mucha seguridad pero ahora va a haber menos interesados en comprar o los inversionistas van a pedir tasas m s altas
204398 hoy en d a la cuesti n impositiva no est en la cabeza de la gente a la hora de tomar decisiones de inversi n lo que va a lograr esta medida es que se instale la tem tica y eso puede tener un impacto en la toma de decisiones
204399 en un princpio puede ser que se desaliente un poco
204400 pero este instrumento da algunas seguridades que pueden pesar m s que el pago de ganancias
204401 a la gente no le importa la medida aunque quiere mantenerse dentro de l mites seguros pero es empujada a tomar por encima de esos l mites
204402 a 53 year old man was seen walking down a bridleway on the renault site
204403 a few moments later a shot was fired his body was discovered at the scene and he had died from a shot to the head
204404 we are not treating this incident as suspicious and a file has been passed to the coroner
204405 our pace wasnt where we wanted it to be in the morning session so we made a few changes in the break between sessions the changes worked better for us as we certainly found some more pace in the afternoon we still have some work to do this evening to make sure we get the best from the car tomorrow i also know that i have to do some work to improve my pace as well
204406 it shouldnt happen they have taken six years of not only anwars life but our lives too
204407 but i think probably i also had the image that is not tainted as a wife of a minister and the deputy prime minister i dont think there were stories about me i am pretty much clean
204408 she was 17 she is my first born daughter all i heard was suddenly she was out of the country it wasnt told to me where she was going and what she was going to do
204409 i suddenly found out she was not at home and was overseas as a mother i felt worried i was already worried about her father i have to worry about her thats how i felt it was a bit difficult emotionally but after that i accepted it
204410 when i contested the first time they knew it was because anwar was in prison and when i contested the second time too because of the same reason and in 2008 anwar couldnt contest
204411 i wasnt really a fulltime housewife i was also a patron of many societies doing charity and voluntary work and i enjoy that sometimes of course i miss it because i like simple life
204412 we are pleased to have signed this agreement with daewoong which marks an important step in our business development in both south korea and southeast asia in this region we hope to emulate the success that our commercially proven technologies have already achieved with currently marketed products in the united states european union and japan based on its successful track record in south korea we believe daewoong is well positioned to maximize the market opportunity for this unique once daily muscle relaxant with this agreement we look forward to increasing our presence in southeast asian markets through additional partnerships and collaborations with leading pharmaceutical companies in the region
204413 eurand is an ideal partner for us and cyclobenzaprine er is an excellent fit with our portfolio providing us the opportunity to offer physicians and patients the benefits of convenient dosing and low rates of sedation we believe theres a substantial market opportunity in south korea for this once daily muscle relaxant
204414 people feel bad about economic issues they are concerned that the political bickering in this country is not helping to generate solutions

204416 you can create this social environment with a blog that wasnt possible before
204417 friends and family can not only read diary entries but they can respond and so become part of the story
204418 it also allows travelers to reach a much wider audience than the simple postcard its a nice way to keep in touch
204419 i started collecting in 1957 and ive been hooked ever since
204420 postcards are personal they show youve been thinking about someone you have to pick the right one and then sit down and consider that person what message you want to write to them
204421 the pictures are great and its a nice souvenir plus you have something fun in the mail when you get home besides all the bills that accumulated while you were away
204422 e mail is great but is effortless when i get a postcard from a friend it makes me feel so special they made the extra effort to pick out one just for me physically write on it and send it off
204423 i bought two postcards in sweden last week but i didnt actually send them its just the effort i have to sit down find a pen and post them and everything
204424 in the end i came back and gave them as gifts
204425 gorgeous lovely i think thats the one you should buy
204426 oh this one was like this before i got here
204427 madame bleh que vous avez bleh bleh et cest possible que bleh
204428 je ne comprende pas a fucking thing you just said bleh
204429 gorgeous lovely i think thats the one you should buy
204430 oh this one was like this before i got here
204431 madame bleh que vous avez bleh bleh et cest possible que bleh
204432 je ne comprende pas a fucking thing you just said bleh
204433 the name of the deceased is not being released at this time
204434 there are that many questions we want to ask and we have got no answers at the moment
204435 lincolnshire police can confirm that we are investigating a formal complaint made by mr david curnock from leicester
204436 the complaint concerns the way police dealt with his daughter emily curnock who was the passenger in a car seized by the police in sutton on sea lincolnshire on tuesday 8 july
204437 we promised her a white wedding she never had that so we gave her a decent send off
204438 last night i was a trillionaire today ill be using coins
204439 losing marc and alan who have been so important to this company and to me personally is extremely difficult
204440 i speak for all of us when i say that we are in total shock this has been a sad sad day for all of us
204441 our hearts go out to everyone who has been affected by this tragedy
204442 everyone at revel entertainment is deeply saddened by todays tragedy
204443 the loss of revel executives and our partners from tishman construction and apg is a heartbreak to all on the team the thoughts and prayers of our entire organization are with the family and friends of todays victims
204444 it shows the hazards of flying and the hazards of life and theres nothing you can do about either you have to get the best equipment and the best pilots and even then you need a lot of luck
204445 it was a shocking blow to everyone here to see three very vibrant people with such a great mixture of talent leadership and marketing skills lost like that in their prime so suddenly
204446 it made you remember how fragile life is and todays tragedy is doing the same thing
204447 this hearing will go on we need to make sure that the state department is not giving u s tax dollars to those on the other side in the war on terrorism
204448 i know there are many in our community so desperate for peace that they want us to sweep under the rug the pro terrorism positions of some groups there are groups in the islamic world truly dedicated to peace but we should not blind ourselves to the fact that some are not
204449 if we are going to look at suspects we should look at groups that benefit the most from these kinds of incidents and i think we should put the state of israel on the suspect list
204450 a close disciple of the late hassan al banna of egypt
204451 the muslim public affairs council should apologize for the statements of its executive director on september 11 2001 and should disown and sever all connection with the hathout brothers
204452 due to the compression needed to fit the games assets on two dvds
204453 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
204454 we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain who has fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
204455 weve seen this happen before and were not going to let it happen to us
204456 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
204457 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
204458 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
204459 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
204460 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
204461 me and my mum have asked for police help to get the liaison officer to be able to contact the brazilian embassy to try to get things speeded up we are going to be taken now to a london police station from there my mum can get her head together and get her thoughts together
204462 i dont think the israeli public is saying oh we know that youre guilty i think the israeli public didnt trust him after the war and felt that he couldnt do the job properly because he was facing so many legal scandals
204463 the public has been pressuring him for awhile to step down from all the corruption allegations and i think hes made the right choice and the right choice for the country by stepping down
204464 last night i was a trillionaire today ill be using coins
204465 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
204466 last night i was a trillionaire today ill be using coins
204467 mr george now has the right to be regarded as an innocent man but that does not mean it was wrong to bring the case
204468 our test is always whether there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction it would be wholly wrong to only bring cases where we were guaranteed a conviction
204469 it is impossible to know what weight if any the jury attached to the fdr evidence
204470 just as likely that the single particle of fdr came from some extraneous source as it was that it came from a gun fired by the appellant
204471 witnesses and other witnesses from the forensic science service told the court of appeal that this was not the right conclusion to draw from the discovery of the particle of fdr
204472 it was in fact no more likely that the particle had come from a gun fired by barry george than that it had come from some other source
204473 i just meant to shoot the sonofabitch in the head him dying was between him and the lord
204474 we see those three in particular as markets wed like to add to our home market list
204475 we are happy to transfer our expertise to overseas markets
204476 the defence business will continue to grow this acquisition will provide additional growth in the uk
204477 but the lacklustre top line performance coupled with the overhang of the doj us department of justice investigation is likely to somewhat offset the increased guidance
204478 we are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation
204479 when we are able to give out any pertinent information we will certainly let the public and the media know
204480 the army has barred residents from returning to some areas because there are unexploded grenades from the fighting and the troops are defusing them one by one
204481 los gr ficos estar n a la altura y prueba de ello es que desde cualquier punto veremos todo el escenario en tiempo real
204482 los jugadores utilizar n el wiimando para mirar alrededor sentir en entorno trepar e incluso para luchar contra los enemigos queremos que el control del wiimando ayude a generar una atm sfera a n m s aterradora
204483 the police say its so so its a machine pistol
204484 lo principal es el tema deportivo como siempre jugar el partido de vuelta en casa es una ventaja y a ellos tambi n les va bien jugar el primer partido en casa por tema econ mico
204485 no tenemos que hablar mucho de la grandeza de los clubes que nos han tocado sino concentrarnos en nosotros mismos debemos mantener la actitud de la pretemporada para garantizar el xito
204486 we have performed quite well it is another historic set of numbers for petronas group
204487 we cant come to a final decision because we need to make an assessment of the price costs and the viability of the project
204488 i can put the great tradition in one word privilege
204489 i think there is some silver lining here in higher gas prices in that we will see a public health gain
204490 when that happens we drive more we drive bigger cars we drive faster and fatalities are higher
204491 there are a whole bunch of factors that are influenced by higher gasoline prices teenagers dont have as much money so you have the most risky drivers driving less people are switching out of the bigger older more dangerous vehicles and people also know if they drive slower theyre going to save gasoline
204492 so from a societal viewpoint higher gasoline prices have a great number of benefits and one of the most important benefits is fewer traffic fatalities
204493 but given that we get such consistent stories across the two time periods in both studies with somewhat different methodology they seem to be pretty robust estimates
204494 by combining the most modern and precise methods of production and tradition with an insistence in quality and excellence we are producing instruments that is second to none even compared to many considerably more expensive and well known instruments
204495 we are so pleased at this partnership opportunity with hailun
204496 we will take great pride in offering these superb pianos which are becoming the piano of choice for anyone who has played one
204497 we visualized in great detail the nose the eyes according to the chemical composition
204498 i was really surprised by the quality of the image which is really promising for the future of research
204499 that was the worst part not having a say as to whats happening in my own life
204500 to a singer thats like telling them theyre dying it was tragic
204501 id hear a song on the radio and wish mine was next but i respect a lot of the artists whove come along since i was out especially rihanna shes smart and shes worked the business instead of having the business work her
204502 ive been planning my wedding in my head since i was a little girl and it just keeps getting more elaborate im a huge fan of the caribbean so if i dont get married in new york it would have to be on the beach
204503 we have assembled a very good exploration production and development team it will take our combined efforts to realize the potential that sentry represents alan hart will be instrumental in key exploration activities in the adavale basin and especially with the sherwood park project
204504 despite the undeniable potential of the chinese market it remains to be seen how the music industry can successfully capture the opportunity wawawa opens this huge new market to the independent sector for the first time with an offering that we believe is the right combination of convenience price and content selection for the increasingly adventurous chinese music fan
204505 with r2g and the wawawa weve found an ideal partner with the local industry knowledge experience and reputation needed for long term success
204506 ioda not only has a great catalog of quality music but also shares our belief that offering a wide selection of music at fair prices is what music fans in china ultimately want and that the market is ready for it
204507 in the current environment music knowledge is narrowly defined by whats made available through piracy this leaves music discovery to chance providing no guide for fans to connect with one another and share their passion for the artists they love r2gs partnership with ioda will change all that
204508 our label paper bag records arranged for us to play two shows in beijing in may which were both electric hundreds of kids danced and screamed while we played the crowd answering my screams with one hungry unified screaming voice back at me unlike anything i had ever experienced before
204509 it was incredibly moving and you got the sense that the local music community was totally energized theres definitely something important developing here and its rooted in a growing appetite for new ideas and music
204510 i believe that efficient supply chain management is critical to achieving a strong competitive advantage our partnership with g o s s provides us the best opportunity for achieving maximum efficiency while maintaining cost control over the warehouse function
204511 betrayed the nation and brought disgrace and shame to their people they will suffer in life and the afterlife
204512 the basic ideas of investing are to look at stocks as business use the markets fluctuations to your advantage and seek a margin of safety thats what ben graham taught us a hundred years from now they will still be the cornerstones of investing
204513 i want to give my kids just enough so that they would feel that they could do anything but not so much that they would feel like doing nothing
204514 power to the poor off grid lighting from cassava waste in nigeria
204515 there will be four lighting points in their homes were thinking in terms of basic lighting they will be able to use their tv cassette player that sort of thing but it will not be able to power a refrigerator
204516 these people currently rely on kerosene lamps that are very bad for emissions and pollution we also plan to provide them with low wattage lamps that use just 5kw to bring down usage
204517 this can never replace fossil fuels because of the huge demand we have for them but we can help to reduce greenhouse emissions by creating alternative sources of energy
204518 fifty to sixty years ago we used to have huge glaciers here the retired civil engineer told cnn
204519 they have been reduced now because of global warming and now they are on high peaks
204520 and it then occurred to me why not try and make artificial glaciers in the winter so that local farmers get a real headstart when they need it most
204521 we are getting very little amounts and we need a lot more i hope to get more as this year i want to make two or three more glaciers with a new design to improve the efficiency
204522 watershed development is the only solution for ladakhs rural economy otherwise you will have rural folk flocking the city in search of jobs and there are not many to go around
204523 we are a very small pride when compared with the big three of london brighton and manchester but we like to think that we have a big heart and can produce a good day out for everyone regardless of sexuality
204524 that all gays and lesbians were killed off by aids i hope the lot of you die a painful death
204525 hearts and minds of all local people have not yet been won over
204526 dawgs as they are affectionately called by their rabid fan base will be in the hunt for their first national championship since 1980 when a freshman tailback named herschel walker was painfully introducing himself to linebackers throughout the southeastern conference
204527 our state of mind going into every game is that its going to be a 60 minute war if we think its going to be anything different were in trouble
204528 i mean im thinking of what plays were going to call in an overtime period before the game even starts we know theyre all going to be tough
204529 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
204530 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
204531 thorium power is committed to supporting the uae nuclear energy program for the long term and we are proud of their confidence in our company as reflected in these new five year agreements we are advising the uae on the design development and management of the key organizations required to implement a nuclear energy program according to the highest international standards since last year we have worked closely with senior decision makers in the uae government to develop a roadmap for the countrys potential future nuclear energy program and more recently to manage critical path activities for the program

204533 i am very excited to see this division of freedom unfold
204534 our mortgage resolutions division was created to alleviate this gap and it has been well received by mortgage professionals at all levels we have been able to attract the highest quality of talent in ohio indiana alabama minnesota illinois georgia kentucky pennsylvania tennessee mississippi florida nevada wisconsin north and south dakota and north carolina we continue to look for displaced mortgage sales professionals willing to roll up their sleeves and help do something good for at risk home owners
204535 when a home owner is at the point of foreclosure proceedings they are typically frightened and dont know where to turn our professionals are trained to apply the experience they have garnered within their local market to work with all parties to navigate a favorable outcome fmr has successfully negotiated approximately 60 of our cases to settlement
204536 it is appropriate at this time that the company fully explore all alternatives to ensure that the best possible return to shareholders are achieved blackmonts experience and expertise will be beneficial to the shareholders in this process
204537 were extremely pleased our employees and customers helped make this award possible for our colorado voip company
204538 in only our third year of business our aggressive voip rollout our fun working environment and expert sales team have successfully transitioned hundreds of denver businesses from their old phone service to our more affordable and feature rich internet phone service
204539 evaluation of natural human interferon alpha lozenges in the prevention amelioration of winter colds and flu in perth western australia
204540 we have been collaborating with dr beilharz for more than 10 years
204541 during that time dr beilharz has published 10 scientific papers or abstracts on the low dose oral use of interferon we are pleased to extend our research collaboration with dr beilharz his exciting discoveries regarding how oral interferon can protect against influenza are critically important as the world prepares for the next influenza pandemic
204542 we published in 2007 that interferon in the mouth protects mice against fatal influenza
204543 our goal in our new human research is to determine if oral interferon will not only address the influenza issue but will also address a new approach to winter colds and flu like conditions
204544 hoped that these answers would enable stockholders to make logical decisions as to whether or not they should buy or sell the companys stock
204545 with the beginning of our drilling programme ubr has started on the most exiting and potentially rewarding phase of the investigation of the uskawanis uranium property the initial list of anomalies generated by gap has been substantially reduced by our experienced field team and ubr is now concentrating its efforts to assess and develop the more significant targets identified
204546 the widespread nature of the uranium mineralization at uskawanis has now had preliminary investigation and it is confirmed that there are a number of good size uranium targets this continues to support our belief in the potential for significant mineralization at the uup
204547 ubrs driven methodical and scientific approach to uranium exploration confirms our leadership position in uranium exploration in the province of quebec currently recognized as one of the best jurisdiction in the world for natural resource exploration

204550 i am delighted to have been reappointed to the equality commission
204551 the commission has for many years now worked towards the elimination of discrimination in all of the protected equality grounds including sexual orientation
204552 recent controversial comments made it clear that while good legislation covering sexual orientation and gender is in place that there is for some still a very long way to travel before lgbt people and others can command full equality and enjoy respect in northern ireland
204553 under the leadership and direction of bob collins for the last three years the commission has continued to carry out its crucial role in promoting and protecting equality in northern ireland
204554 a key institution of the belfast agreement the commissions value cannot be underestimated in the continuing advancement of the governments vision for a shared and inclusive society in northern ireland
204555 her hospital visit was precautionary she will be returning home shortly at present she is surrounded by family friends and fabulous jewels
204556 im in a bad mood i dont want to be in a good mood no signing hymns
204557 i go to church and i love to hear hymns
204558 if you dont fix this youre not going to be here
204559 i was kind of surprised to be honest with you
204560 and im very thankful for the opportunity and coach holmgren and his staff and the people in the front office for believing in me after going through what i went through last year
204561 hey its a tough business sometimes if he couldnt handle that little bit with me it gets a lot harder than that
204562 id been a school teacher for a long time now and so i kind of know how its going to work before i do something at least i think i do i try not to back a player into a corner unless i think im going to get the response i need
204563 just getting a feel for my surroundings and endurance was the biggest deal being able to last for a while
204564 really the only thing that prevents him from being very very successful on every play is leonard
204565 hes strong enough hes fast enough he has great skill he has become a very good blocker
204566 of course were all competing but ive never gotten sour
204567 still he gave the clearest indication yet that conditions in iraq would allow him to begin reducing the number of american troops there before he leaves office in less than six months
204568 he repeated what the pentagon had already announced troops deploying to iraq beginning today will serve 12 month tours rather than the 15 months they were expecting
204569 there now appears to be a degree of durability in gains
204570 i think were getting things right most of the time now
204571 our footprint of activity now extends from mosul to basra
204572 pardon brings cautious response from some war exiles in canada
204573 try to imagine the reaction to someone spitting on a soldier returning from iraq
204574 generally if someone shows up and we have a bed available they can stay
204575 we have developed some instincts and discernment skills over time and use those when making decisions about guests we dont take in families its not a good space for kids we have only three rules that pretty much cover everything no drugs no alcohol and respectful behaviour to everyone in the house
204576 senior white house officials told the committee that white house officials held mr abramoff and members of his lobbying team in high regard and solicited recommendations from mr abramoff and his colleagues on policy matters
204577 for nearly two years a young political aide sought to cultivate a farm system for republicans at the
204578 that aide monica m goodling exercised what amounted to veto power over a wide range of critical jobs asking candidates for their views on abortion and same sex marriage and maneuvering around senior officials who outranked her including the departments second in command the report concluded yesterday that goodling and others had broken civil service laws run afoul of department policy and engaged in misconduct a finding that could expose them to further scrutiny and sanctions
204579 nor is it the work of a few bad individuals
204580 the conservatism that speaks to us through its actions in washington is institutionally opposed to those baseline good intentions we learned about in elementary school its leaders laugh off the idea of the public interest as airy fairy nonsense they caution against bringing top notch talent into government service they declare war on public workers they have made a cult of outsourcing and privatizing they have wrecked established federal operations because they disagree with them and they have deliberately piled up an everest of debt in order to force the government into crisis the ruination they have wrought has been thorough it has been a professional job repairing it will require years of political action
204581 we are a free and sovereign people we govern ourselves and the government is ours but that is the point we are responsible not our leaders since we follow them we let them divert our loyalty from the united states to some party we let them boss the party and turn our municipal democracies into autocracies and our republican nation into a plutocracy we cheat our government and we let our leaders loot it and we let them wheedle and bribe our sovereignty from us
204582 wow thats fantastic but you need an adult to help you out because you have to be a registered voter
204583 but before we get into logistics i dont often get calls from 16 year olds can you tell me how you know about ralph
204584 two years ago mr nader came to my high school
204585 i helped organize that there was a standing room only crowd what did you think of ralphs speech
204586 i was a freshman and i was in world history class and my class didnt go i guess they thought that ralph didnt fit with world history
204587 yeah but ive been interested in mr nader since then reading about him and i want to help him
204588 today was truly amazing no more than a few days ago i felt an overwhelming feeling of worthlessness i felt that there was nothing that i could do due to my age and transportation issue then we talked and i went out and did something i truly felt like i was a part of something that i was making history i could have volunteered for many other political campaigns but it was the nader gonzalez campaign that truly inspired me i can openly support every policy of the campaign and sleep at night this is a campaign that puts national interest before personal interest we the people not for sale gives me chills it is truly amazing to see an entire organization of everyday people working towards one beautiful common goal and putting power back into the hands of the people
204589 to see the different stages of my life through the work that was quite shocking
204590 i got quite emotional and i thought i would be a lot more analytical and distance myself from it
204591 last week with the instalment i got to an emotional grinding halt where it felt a bit too much
204592 i dont mind getting slagged off for one show but i dont want to get slagged off for this one because it is so immense and so much work i need support at the moment
204593 what they dont understand is that the more they kick you down the tougher you get
204594 so 20 years thats enough just to wind people up because im not going away am i

204676 clearly obama still has some work to do to convince americans he can handle some of the international responsibilities of the presidency
204677 while he already is viewed as being better than mccain at handling relations with other countries mccain has wide advantages over obama in perceptions that he would be able to handle the job of commander in chief and to do a good job of handling the terrorism issue
204678 even though fewer americans say obama is able to handle the role of commander in chief than say this about mccain it is important to note that a majority of americans think the illinois senator is up to the task in some ways it may not be as important for obama to close this perceptual gap with mccain as it is to keep his own percentage above the majority level that may especially be true in an election year when americans rate domestic issues like the economy and energy as the top issues that will affect their vote thus obama could in theory win the election on the basis of his perceived strengths on domestic issues so long as americans dont disqualify him for perceived weaknesses on military and defense issues
204679 a year from now we may all be saying how on earth could they have given up on manny and a good player like moss and a good young reliever like hansen for jason bay but that just goes to show you how dire the situation with ramirez had become before the sox shipped him to the dodgers at the trade deadline today
204680 as much as ramirez was a pain in the pillows as much as he caused angst and disgust you cant help but get the feeling that the red sox ultimately caved in here ramirez got what he wanted
204681 a guy who occasionally swings like babe ruth and is consistently as nutty as a baby ruth
204682 indeed other than the red soxs terry francona probably the only other current major league manager who can handle ramirez is torre who constantly dealt with wacky late season acquisitions with the new york yankees
204683 colletti pulled this off without giving up on any of the dodgers major prospects and did we mention the red sox are paying ramirez his remaining 7 million
204684 its like colletti announcing hes going to produce a movie and will smith calling to say he wants to be in it for free
204685 the way i see it losing a lot the rest of this season and all of next would be a blessing in the form of higher first round picks and if fewer people come to the ballpark how exactly would you be able to tell
204686 nothing is guaranteed of course huntington might prove every bit as unskilled as his predecessors owner bob nutting might never spend enough money to field a legitimate contender but im willing to give this thing a chance at least theres a plan
204687 pirates management in its various incarnations has been writing this script for 16 years an evident narrative arc to nowhere
204688 characters come and go none fully developed and they are replaced by others far less developed and if you were chilled by chapter 2008 wait until you see chapter 2009
204689 judge it by dollars or by sense this trade had no major obstacles except that the marlins werent committed to making it happen
204690 cant see why not especially with the marlins trying to crush a stadium stopping lawsuit with proof of south floridas need for them if the whole affair was a pr stunt meant to give the appearance of a franchise willing to do anything to reach the world series again it clearly backfired florida fans are tired of being teased
204691 i give the marlins credit for what apparently was a very serious effort to make a very significant deal aimed solely at this pennant race and the 2008 postseason
204692 this isnt your normal collection of ballplayers wearing the black and white
204693 they are not in other words going to win another world series this year
204694 the sox remain a big plodding muscular team that hits for power carlos quentin jermaine dye jim thome griffey joe crede when he returns but has trouble manufacturing runs any other way theyd be great in home run derby a recipe for glory it is not
204695 ken griffey jr in center field at the cell a cause to rejoice set off the fireworks
204696 if you can get a guy who has more home runs than frank robinson mark mcgwire harmon killebrew reggie jackson mike schmidt mickey mantle ernie banks and lou gehrig hallelujah and amen
204697 in hindsight he never fit griffey never embraced cincinnati cincinnati didnt give him much of a chance
204698 this isnt a great town for superstars we dont cater well in that respect griffey was always too big a presence he wanted room service we pointed to the drive through
204699 it is a sad time in cincinnati but perhaps it is the dawn of the gm walt jocketty era he was brought in as general manager to turn around seven straight years of losing
204700 trading griffey to the chicago white sox is the beginning younger players are the future not a 38 year old outfielder whose skills are eroding fast due to age and enough injuries to use as a living model for a medical school
204701 in our society there is an ever decreasing amount of time for either healthy food or exercise
204702 compound that with people who had a medical need people who have long hospital stays and surgery and as a result are inactive and disabled i believe the availability of drugs that could stimulate the effect of exercise could reduce muscle wasting or atrophy
204703 wada commits significant resources to anticipate doping trends including by closely cooperating with research teams and pharmaceutical companies at very early stages of the development
204704 the bottom line is that interfering with normal genetic mechanisms in living organisms are not to be taken lightly and not to be undertaken except for the treatment of serious disease

204759 luke in a way has been preparing for this moment all his life
204760 he grew up in the loving care of two world class journalists
204761 we are delighted and pleased to have two such exciting artists as jack and alicia who were inspired by our film to join together their extraordinary talents in creating a unique sound for quantum of solace
204762 i normally set my songs to the side for a while and let the ideas ripen
204763 the guitarist singer wrote most of the songs using a keyboard and drum machine
204764 the little break that system of a down took in no way stole any of the unbelievable energy that the individual band members exhibit
204765 it was only once we started talking about the idea that it sank in how many singles theres been from what about me right through to loud and in pieces all these songs mean so much to me and showcase a journey that ive been through with my songwriting and recording my career in general its great to have the new songs on the album as they are just a taste of what weve got planned for next year
204766 this is a wonderful charity i am so proud to be part of bringing joy and hope
204767 i do this because i love making and performing music not because i want to see some magazine comment on what designer dress i have borrowed for an event or the latest happenings in my personal life i want people to discover my music and hopefully fall in love with it
204768 when i got back the albums first mix i was in tears because it was the kind of music i wanted to make it was familiar yet modern
204769 the whole thing was a trip im still figuring out how i want to write about it and talk about the last few days that were so amazing i had an extraordinary tour you share experiences with other artists that is almost unfathomable it was about bringing people together and empowering them and making them feel good about themselves it was an amazing time in vancouver i had to stop the show and say excuse me excuse me do you realize what were doing it was like oh my god we are doing this together i hope people feel empowered about it and they got the information they need to achieve what they needed in their life
204770 i was inspired by their humour by their sensitivity by what they wrote about by their energy by tegans zest for her work and her life and the way she looked at things also just the passion for their own work is inspiring i must say that it also changes your own perspective on yourself
204771 unfortunately sometimes ill look on youtube and think oh my god why did i think that looked good why did i wear that so i cant really look at myself and live in the moment and let it go because youll never be who you think you are in your mind in your mind youre much taller laughs and your hair is long and flowing you look completely different
204772 i had done two special projects at last and body acoustic which were great to do but i wanted to get back to making my regular work again and writing
204773 i always love working in a community of artists its always a petrie dish it doesnt always come out the way you like but this one did when i got back the first mix of high and mighty i was in tears because it was the kind of music i wanted to make it was familiar yet modern
204774 i tried not to make every vocal the same i tried to find the character of the story teller i especially loved in raging storm to sing in octaves in one song and the low octave in the next song lay me down it had intrigued me to bend over backwards to find these different characters it was tricky it was like a big old puzzle but we got it together
204775 i was taking pictures like that because at a certain time in history as women we were sold a bill of goods
204776 but this woman in the picture is still holding onto her disco ball her joy shes still having a party wherever she goes and shes going to keep her joy no matter what i thought using props like gnomes and the disco ball and the broom were pretty funny
204777 its extremely exciting i cant believe its taken this long but ive already started putting the set list together and there are so many songs to play i have been inspired by some intimate shows i have done recently here and internationally and by playing theatres i can be closer to all the people who have taken my record home
204778 you dont feel that connection when people take your albums home theres
204779 i would have liked to tour earlier but im just glad i can finally mtell people the dates when they ask me when im touring next there are lots of songs from over the years people know to sing along with and im going to do some fun covers but i dont want to spoil the surprise
204780 at both of my meetings with brady he made it plain that he was able to help pinpoint the whereabouts of keith bennetts body on saddleworth moor
204781 it is he and he alone who has the ability to bring to an end the appalling ordeal of keiths mother winnie johnson which has now lasted 44 years
204782 if this is what i hope and pray it is then it is keith bennetts body but we cant be certain of that
204783 i for one would be absolutely delighted as it would bring to an end a 44 year old mystery and finally bring to winnie johnson the closure she needs and deserves
204784 they didnt say why they wanted me or where they were taking me but there was nothing i could do
204785 there were maybe 20 gunmen surrounding the house and my family was here
204786 they say on the news they arrested people because of the bombing on gaza beach but they didnt even ask me about it they know i dont even know how to use a gun they just want to scare us
204787 we dont arrest people just to arrest people there are no political reasons
204788 i say clearly anyone who is found to have nothing to do with the bombing will be released
204789 she was laughing and drawing sand circles around me and her grandmother then she was dead now i cant bring myself to go into her room or any of the places she spent time it is too upsetting
204790 last night i was a trillionaire today ill be using coins
204791 the bible helps make sense in my life when the world doesnt when you fail to read the bible you rob god of the honor of being the author of a well read book but you also rob yourself of peace comfort strength and a sense that god will make all things right if you ask me thats a price too high to pay
204792 it is impossible to enslave mentally or socially a bible reading people the principles of the bible are the groundwork of human freedom
204793 so great is my veneration of the bible i have for many years made it a practice to read through the bible once every year
204794 34 percent of the contents of americas founding documents were direct quotations from the bible
204795 christians who lack biblical knowledge are the products of churches that marginalize bibical knowlege
204796 the zenn requires no gas and is as simple as plugging in a cellphone to recharge
204797 electric vehicles are the future and the driver of the industrial revolution
204798 if you are an at risk individual meaning that you have underlying cardiovascular disease with partly blocked or narrowed blood vessels this increased tendency to form blood clots may put you at risk for developing a heart attack or stroke
204799 the pollution levels could be 10 times higher than most people are used to
204800 if you spend a few weeks in beijing your blood might become thicker and sticky and then when you fly back home that further increases your risk
204801 if clots migrate into the lungs and cause pulmonary embolism that could kill you
204802 it could be disastrous to have mothers experimenting with their egg allergic children
204803 these increased risks are due to long term effects of the original cancer and its treatment as well as to genetic conditions that predisposed the survivors to multiple cancers smoking would be an additional source of risk for this population
204804 where is the life we have lost in living where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge where is the knowledge we have lost in information
204805 the commissions view is that it would not be able to issue finalised guidance in this area until the relevant primary legislation had received royal assent and the commission had carefully considered the wider context in which guidance would operate and consulted widely on the content of the guidance
204806 come into effect when the bill receives royal assent candidate spending infringements are regulated by the police and the courts
204807 the electoral commission acknowledges current rules on campaign funding are ineffective
204808 we have said for some time that we think the current regulated period for candidate spending is too short but that any change in the rules would need to address the scope for uncertainty and avoidance
204809 it may be possible to achieve this with the right combination of statutory rules and commission guidance

204957 yao did not criticize artest he specifically said that he did not intend to imply that artest was not welcome he said that artest was a talented very good player and could help the team but unless youve been living under a rock for the past decade you have to know that artest has also had his issues most notably the riot at the palace of auburn hills where he was at the center all yao said was that he and luis scola shared their excitement and their concerns and said that he wanted to talk to artest to make sure everybody was on the same page now theyve talked now maybe everybody who had their shorts in a knot can relax

204960 bobby jackson said he is atypical of the player entering the final years of his contract who a la artest would play with the partial purpose of landing a larger contract the following summer he hopes to play three more seasons and knows hell likely share minutes with bobby brown behind starter beno udrih but jackson said he wasnt overly concerned about his pay my thing is not to come in and look at it like im furthering my career jackson said im probably going to play two years beyond next season depending on how my body feels but just probably at the minimum ive made my money i just want to be around get two more years in then learn the coaching aspect of it and try to be a coach after two years the kings jackson said fully support those aspirations

205041 so far everything is going well weve had a super response people are already asking us about signing up for next year which i think is the biggest compliment we could get
205042 were going to sit here and were going to point the finger and let the jury know that tracy holcomb killed brooklyn
205043 there is no direct evidence connecting mr holcomb to this crime it is entirely circumstantial
205044 i dont know if theres any direct evidence connecting the defendant because i havent heard the evidence
205045 the court will wait to see what the witnesses testify to at trial i dont see any other way the court can rule
205046 the court intends on sticking to this trial date unless we absolutely cant
205047 its really fun and you get to do a lot of stuff you wouldnt get to do otherwise

205062 thorium power is committed to supporting the uae nuclear energy program for the long term and we are proud of their confidence in our company as reflected in these new five year agreements we are advising the uae on the design development and management of the key organizations required to implement a nuclear energy program according to the highest international standards since last year we have worked closely with senior decision makers in the uae government to develop a roadmap for the countrys potential future nuclear energy program and more recently to manage critical path activities for the program
205063 the two new agreements provide a long term platform for our consulting business launched in 2007 our strategic advisory services are based on unique and innovative expertise integrated across a wide range of competence areas and with particular emphasis on non proliferation safety and long term economics our consulting business gives us the opportunity to generate revenue early in the nuclear renaissance while simultaneously pursuing longer term upside from our technology licensing business

205073 despite the undeniable potential of the chinese market it remains to be seen how the music industry can successfully capture the opportunity wawawa opens this huge new market to the independent sector for the first time with an offering that we believe is the right combination of convenience price and content selection for the increasingly adventurous chinese music fan
205074 with r2g and the wawawa weve found an ideal partner with the local industry knowledge experience and reputation needed for long term success
205075 ioda not only has a great catalog of quality music but also shares our belief that offering a wide selection of music at fair prices is what music fans in china ultimately want and that the market is ready for it
205076 in the current environment music knowledge is narrowly defined by whats made available through piracy this leaves music discovery to chance providing no guide for fans to connect with one another and share their passion for the artists they love r2gs partnership with ioda will change all that
205077 our label paper bag records arranged for us to play two shows in beijing in may which were both electric hundreds of kids danced and screamed while we played the crowd answering my screams with one hungry unified screaming voice back at me unlike anything i had ever experienced before
205078 it was incredibly moving and you got the sense that the local music community was totally energized theres definitely something important developing here and its rooted in a growing appetite for new ideas and music
205079 we are delighted with investor interest in the companys projects and a successful first close despite a challenging time in the capital markets the company is now well positioned with over cdn 8 million in cash to advance the work programs on its priority projects in quebec

205094 there are around 41 fewer first time buyers now than at the same time last year

205106 it also allows travelers to reach a much wider audience than the simple postcard its a nice way to keep in touch
205107 i started collecting in 1957 and ive been hooked ever since
205108 postcards are personal they show youve been thinking about someone you have to pick the right one and then sit down and consider that person what message you want to write to them
205109 the pictures are great and its a nice souvenir plus you have something fun in the mail when you get home besides all the bills that accumulated while you were away
205110 e mail is great but is effortless when i get a postcard from a friend it makes me feel so special they made the extra effort to pick out one just for me physically write on it and send it off
205111 i bought two postcards in sweden last week but i didnt actually send them its just the effort i have to sit down find a pen and post them and everything
205112 in the end i came back and gave them as gifts
205113 questo il nirvana di ci che abbiamo immaginato per anni

205118 many of the scenes depicted in this book are actually false
205119 we are the nicest looking books you will ever own
205120 every one of these cartoons is just something that drifted into my head when i was alone with my thoughts and for better or worse i jotted them down
205121 time is healing the wounds said lorraine hariton a major clinton backer at whose home the cocktail hour event was held
205122 im very pleased with how well the obama people are getting their people out
205123 change is a president who walked with you on that picket line who doesnt choke when he says the word union who doesnt denigrate public service by privatizing jobs every chance he gets
205124 you stood with me and i will always stand with you
205125 the bush administration and its allies have led an unyielding uncompromising unrelenting campaign against our government
205126 thats why i will work with all of you to ensure we have a democratic victory in november
205127 when we finally have that democratic president and a bigger democratic majority in the senate were going to get back to making our government more effective
205128 is an honorable man who has served our country with honor and distinction but he represents the same failed policies and we cannot take four more years of that
205129 the entire world will breathe a sigh of relief when that moving van pulls away from the back of the white house

205132 we dont have to wait for the history books to tell us the bush administration has been disastrous for working families
205133 we will win that battle not 20 years from now not 10 years from now but by the end of my first term as president of the united states
205134 if we put an end to the politics of division and distraction
205135 we are less than 100 days away from the change we seek
205136 its great to have a company like cryptic with such a strong tie to pen and paper gaming co sponsoring this years gen con
205137 their commitment to putting the gamer first and creating fantastic gaming experiences are at the heart of what gen con is all about
205138 well we spent a lot of money on that system and even though it is not meeting our needs and holding us back we need to wait until we have gotten our moneys worth to make a change
205139 daf r braucht die iag jetzt das n tige mandat der politik

205142 often consume a significant amount of management time and attention
205143 should facilitate proposals concerning only those subjects that could properly be brought before a meeting under the corporations charter or bylaws and under state law
205144 to date i am not aware of any company that has sought to implement such a bylaw but it would not come as a surprise if a company decides to do so in the future
205145 the abusive use of the shareholder proposal process by some institutional investors is troubling
205146 what we are seeing basically is large institutional investors who have no duty to other shareholders pushing behind the scenes particular measures that fail at company after company when actually put up for a shareholder vote essentially they are using their particular influence the threat of shame or whatever to try to get the company to acquiesce to their position
205147 lifestyle on that glorious day ill stop drinking and suddenly get my life back on track once i stop drinking everything will fall into place what a brilliant doctor advice like that is surely the best medicine you can get

205152 mr richard holbrooke undertook on behalf of the usa that i would not be tried before this tribunal
205153 the offer was as follows i must withdraw not only from public but also from party offices and completely disappear from the public arena not give interviews and not even publish literary works in a word become invisible long enough for the dayton agreement to be implemented in full
205154 that i get out of the way and go to russia greece or serbia and open a private clinic or at least go to bijeljina just as long as i left pale

205160 baffling case needing more doctors to take a look in the hope that one of them will know what to do
205161 it was discussed the centre and winger at half time theres just no defence to it
205162 they are a superbly drilled side and when they get guys like folau one on one on your tryline theyre impossible to tackle
205163 its a very tough ask to come down here and play melbourne especially coming off a loss
205164 but one positive we can take between now and the rest of the year is that well be back to full strength by the last game so weve just got to hang in by the skin of our teeth
205165 they hit him hard but they still couldnt stop him from getting the ball down
205166 hes worth whatever he gets but i dont know if thats the right figure
205167 he certainly deserves to be highly paid just like my friend here as well
205168 in the first half we had 23 sets and completed 22 of them so that was a huge improvement
205169 to put that sort of pressure on the opposition completing like that is a huge bonus for us that takes a bit of petrol out of them towards the end of the game
205170 well give the boys a rest on sunday but then were going to put in some hard work for that one
205171 so i went off to wallingford to see what i could see they filled me up with poland springs they never let me be
205172 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
205173 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
205174 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
205175 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
205176 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
205177 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
205178 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
205179 we are grateful to the washington post the new york times time magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years it would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years but the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government the supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto determination practiced in past centuries
205180 from what we can tell no group on this list is running the world from behind its locked doors
205181 i felt like if youre going to clean something it really should be clean
205182 but i had seven children i wanted to go on home i told him im not staying these arent slavery times anymore he said i had to stay i walked
205183 one day we decided to march on the welfare office we asked to see their policies their manual of how they would treat us they said the state couldnt do that so we went up the back steps on a friday afternoon went into the directors office and told him we wouldnt let him leave
205184 storming caesars palace how black mothers fought their own war on poverty
205185 finally we understand that the civil rights movement was a lot bigger and longer than martin luther king as wonderful and important as he was
205186 there are so many levels on which this movement was important not only statewide but nationwide
205187 and theres no question ruby was in the absolute forefront
205188 as long as they graduated and walked across that stage that was enough
205189 it was exciting to see how poor people could stand up
205190 just the way she looked you could feel her power it was so uplifting
205191 im glad shes finally being recognized for all that shes done
205192 so many people give up homes so many jobless people
205193 let somebody make me wealthy before i leave just for one year
205194 i would buy me a nice home in a decent neighborhood i would have me a better car i would love to go to one of those hotels lay up and have a massage i would go to paris london italy i would live for once in my life
205195 panera bread understands the importance of supporting the communities it serves
205196 hosting a food drive as part of the introduction of our new breakfast sandwich allows us to help the area food banks reach their goals of feeding hungry families and it gives our customers the opportunity to try paneras fresh idea on breakfast
205197 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
205198 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
205199 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
205200 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass
205201 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
205202 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
205203 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
205204 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
205205 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
205206 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
205207 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
205208 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
205209 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
205210 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
205211 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
205212 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
205213 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
205214 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
205215 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
205216 the music industry is a business like any other but at the helm of this industry is a pool of artists whose work often serves as a barometer to the social and environmental challenges our society faces
205217 its a bit patronizing for us 21 year olds to try to start to change the world
205218 especially when were using enough power for 10 houses just for stage lighting itd be a bit hypocritical
205219 ill be the first to admit that the music industry has some big unavoidable emissions associated with their business
205220 with upward of 60 vehicles getting seven miles per gallon for a single national tour the impact can be pretty staggering
205221 a majority of pollution and waste associated with music tours is actually an effect of the fans themselves driving to and from shows producing waste at the shows littering in parking lots and venues using one use plastic containers for all their food and drink etc
205222 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
205223 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
205224 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
205225 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
205226 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
205227 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
205228 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
205229 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
205230 in 10 to 12 years we will reach the tipping point
205231 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
205232 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
205233 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
205234 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
205235 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
205236 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
205237 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
205238 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
205239 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
205240 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
205241 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
205242 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
205243 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
205244 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
205245 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
205246 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
205247 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
205248 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
205249 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
205250 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
205251 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
205252 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
205253 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
205254 junk propaganda emanating from the intergovernmental panel on climate change and scientists like david suzuki et al
205255 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
205256 if only al gore had stopped with the invention of the internet instead of going on to invent global warming
205257 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
205258 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
205259 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
205260 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
205261 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
205262 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
205263 no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american public
205264 its t boone pickens different political party different persuasion than al saying weve got to move to renewables
205265 the democrats want to just do the renewable energy without additional production additional supply and chalk it up as a victory
205266 distorted t boone pickens words when he said we cant drill ourselves out of this problem
205267 he didnt mean we shouldnt be drilling and finding what we can
205268 he just said we need to do all these things
205269 it helps underscore why we believe gaining grass roots support for the pickens plan has been so successful and is such an integral part going forward
205270 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
205271 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
205272 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
205273 sounds like a gimmick to take advantage of this phony baloney scheme that al gore hatched to fill his own pockets with
205274 stick it on the tailpipe of every car out there
205275 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
205276 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
205277 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
205278 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
205279 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
205280 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
205281 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
205282 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
205283 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
205284 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
205285 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
205286 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
205287 how the women of the media sell unhappiness and liberalism to the women of america
205288 it can be frustrating knowing people who supported clinton and edwards who still say they dont know what to do
205289 hes in danger of being sucked into a negative campaign
205290 mccains trying to make him out to be a risky unsure leader he has to respond but has to stay above the fray its a very thin line
205291 the idea that voters pay attention to three or four critical moments of a campaign is a theory thats outmoded
205292 with the 24 hour news cycle you have a lot more process coverage and everything tends to flatten out instead of peaks and valleys you have more of a straight road a lot of times people simply arent paying attention to whats supposed to be a critical moment
205293 he has problems that no candidate has ever had before
205294 hes the first person of color to be the nominee of his party he had to show he could be on the international stage with foreign leaders and he did that now what he has to do is get back to relating to regular people gore had to do it and never quite succeeded to get there
205295 i tried to get him to water ski because he was good at it i tried to get him to play pick up basketball but he wouldnt do that because he thought hed be copying former new jersey sen bill bradley he played pool and he wouldnt do that in public either these were all things that would make him approachable to ordinary people and he just wouldnt do them that what obama has to do make the public understand what hes really like and how he relates to them
205296 americans are looking to see if he can do the job of president of the united states what we he have to do over the next 97 days in convince them he can
205297 the voters we need to get are people not a whole lot unlike obama
205298 they werent born into a wealthy family and theyve worked hard for what they have obviously you have to demonstrate hes a real person and thats the easiest thing in the world to do because hes the most down to earth candidate ive ever worked for and i think the size of events is important you look at today we have two town halls and a barbecue you cant get much closer to the ground than that i think thats the kind of campaign youll see us run for the rest of the race
205299 are you better off now than you were four years ago
205300 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
205301 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
205302 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
205303 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
205304 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
205305 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
205306 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
205307 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
205308 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
205309 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
205310 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
205311 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
205312 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
205313 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
205314 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
205315 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
205316 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
205317 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
205318 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
205319 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
205320 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
205321 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
205322 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
205323 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
205324 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
205325 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
205326 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
205327 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
205328 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
205329 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
205330 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
205331 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
205332 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
205333 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
205334 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
205335 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
205336 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
205337 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
205338 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
205339 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
205340 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
205341 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
205342 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
205343 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
205344 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
205345 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
205346 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
205347 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
205348 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
205349 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
205350 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
205351 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
205352 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
205353 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
205354 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
205355 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
205356 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
205357 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
205358 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
205359 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
205360 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
205361 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
205362 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
205363 two canaries in the coal mine the first one is in the arctic of course the arctic ocean has a floating ice cap greenland on its side there i say canary in the coal mine because the arctic is one part of the world that is experiencing faster impact from global warming this is the largest ice shelf in the arctic the ward hunt ice shelf it just cracked in half a year ago the scientists were astonished
205364 current coastal temperatures are about 1 c below their 1940 values
205365 at the summit of the greenland ice sheet the summer average temperature has decreased at the rate of 2 2 c per decade since the beginning of the measurements in 1987
205366 colors indicate ice sheet elevation change rate in cm year from satellite altimeter data 1992 2003 the spatially averaged increase is 5 4 0 2 cm year
205367 shut off would imply repeal of the law of conservation of angular momentum widely disseminated and grossly oversimplified pictures showing the ocean as a conveyor belt have misled people into thinking ocean circulation is driven by a sinking motion at high latitudes
205368 temperature records show that the arctic was in fact warmer in the 1930s and 1940s than it is today
205369 2007 winter sea ice extent at both poles reached record highs
205370 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
205371 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
205372 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
205373 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
205374 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
205375 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
205376 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
205377 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
205378 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
205379 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
205380 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
205381 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
205382 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
205383 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
205384 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
205385 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
205386 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
205387 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
205388 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
205389 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
205390 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
205391 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
205392 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
205393 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
205394 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
205395 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
205396 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
205397 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
205398 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
205399 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
205400 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
205401 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
205402 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
205403 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
205404 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
205405 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
205406 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
205407 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
205408 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
205409 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
205410 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
205411 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
205412 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
205413 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
205414 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
205415 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
205416 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
205417 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
205418 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
205419 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
205420 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
205421 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
205422 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
205423 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
205424 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
205425 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
205426 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
205427 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
205428 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
205429 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
205430 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
205431 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
205432 i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president
205433 its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
205434 to those who say the challenge is not politically viable i suggest they go before the american people and try to defend the status quo then bear witness to the peoples appetite for change
205435 some of our greatest accomplishments as a nation have resulted from commitments to reach a goal that fell well beyond the next election the marshall plan social security the interstate highway system
205436 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
205437 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
205438 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
205439 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
205440 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
205441 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
205442 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
205443 i think i have now the largest private collection of richard nixon in the country
205444 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
205445 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
205446 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
205447 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
205448 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
205449 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
205450 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
205451 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
205452 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
205453 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
205454 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
205455 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
205456 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
205457 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
205458 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
205459 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
205460 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help

205472 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
205473 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
205474 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
205475 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
205476 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
205477 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
205478 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
205479 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
205480 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
205481 medicare fraud wastes taxpayer dollars hurts legitimate businesses and shrinks the important resources that should be going to care for our seniors and disabled
205482 our bill will give cms and hhs the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred from pay and chase to detect and prevent
205483 each year roughly 30 to 60 billion a year in taxpayer dollars is wasted because of medicare fraud and abuse this hurts not only taxpayers but medicare recipients and legitimate providers as a result congress should do everything in its power to eliminate fraud and abuse this legislation we are introducing moves our efforts from a pay and chase model to one that takes proactive tangible steps to stop fraud before it begins i hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important effort to protect taxpayers and medicare recipients

205490 dat is dit jaar gestegen tot meer dan drie toepassingen bovendien worden deze toepassingen ook intensiever gebruikt

205492 bei blicher elektronenmikroskopie m ssen die objekte fixiert werden das hei t ihnen wird wasser entzogen und durch ethanol oder aceton ersetzt ehe die proben in kunstharzen eingebettet werden
205493 die kryo elektronentomographie erm glicht hingegen das betrachten von strukturen innerhalb einer intakten zelle also live und lebensnah im schockgefrorenen zustand bei minus 195 grad celsius und mit einer aufl sung von wenigen nanometern
205494 het voorstel gaat namelijk uit van het pre internettijdperk terwijl web 3 0 in aantocht is het huiswerk moet over
205495 dit is de particuliere mening van twee medewerkers en zij laten zien dat zij behoorlijk weinig kennis hebben van het onderwerp
205496 human culture as we have known it for the past 200 years is drawing to a close a revolution of civilization is upon us prepare
205497 the most significant characteristic of modern civilization is the sacrifice of the future for the present and all the power of science has been prostituted to this purpose
205498 nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could only do a little
205499 the power to bargain for higher wages a power that we assume was dismantled may not be so feeble
205500 real wages adjusted for inflation are falling and there is no sign at all of any change in direction
205501 the regional fugitive task force is a program that works with local law enforcement to take the worst of the worst criminal offenders off the street florida is experiencing an increase in violent crime and this program is a priority
205502 this additional 10 million will help to expand the task forces presence in florida
205503 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
205504 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
205505 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
205506 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
205507 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
205508 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
205509 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
205510 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
205511 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
205512 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
205513 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
205514 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
205515 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
205516 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
205517 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
205518 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
205519 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
205520 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
205521 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
205522 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
205523 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
205524 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
205525 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
205526 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
205527 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
205528 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
205529 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
205530 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
205531 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
205532 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
205533 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
205534 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
205535 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
205536 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
205537 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
205538 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
205539 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
205540 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
205541 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
205542 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
205543 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
205544 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
205545 we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain who has fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
205546 weve seen this happen before and were not going to let it happen to us
205547 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
205548 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
205549 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
205550 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
205551 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
205552 the media should be seeing a noticeable difference in accessibility to web sites that they need to report on the olympic games
205553 we cannot remain indifferent to the fate of the prisoners of conscience these peaceful demonstrations will offer a response to the cynicism of those who will sit with their arms crossed inside the beijing stadium on 8 august
205554 this partnership means that customers in regional areas will no longer need to carry around multiple or bulky handsets these unique handsets will refresh our mobile handset range offering next generation gsm style phones to our customers they are the worlds smallest satellite mobile phones and are almost unrecognizable as traditional satellite handsets not to mention their features and intelligence
205555 optus is a valued partner and will act as a major australian national service provider for thurayas proven mobile handheld offerings our partnership will be expanding very soon to include other innovative solutions for broadband marine rural and other specialised applications with an excellent track record in satellite delivery and mobile services optus was a natural choice in the asia pacific region
205556 you know she wasnt the kind that played with dolls and then all of the sudden she has all of these children
205557 fortunately she was not seriously injured and i have no doubt that this was due in no small part to the spirited resistance from the victim and the intervention of local residents
205558 its good news that the amnesty site has been unblocked in the olympics media venues and perhaps elsewhere in beijing but its still a long way from the complete media freedom that was promised
205559 blocking and then unblocking sites for journalists arbitrarily simply doesnt respect basic standards of free speech
205560 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
205561 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
205562 we are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation
205563 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
205564 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
205565 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
205566 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
205567 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
205568 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
205569 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
205570 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
205571 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
205572 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
205573 this new service offers mums to be vital information helping mother and baby to be healthy before during and after the birth
205574 i think that a product such as this is vital especially for first time mothers like myself who dont really know what to expect
205575 this product guides you through step by step giving safe reliable information which is important as other than your doctor and midwife these days people expect to be able to look up everything they need to know on the internet
205576 this is basically a way to run away from competition youre putting a lot of pressure on your less competitive peers
205577 were not quite sure why apple took down the application yet weve received no communication from apple thus far
205578 netshare did not violate any of the developer or appstore agreements were hoping well get some feedback from apple tomorrow
205579 sorry to all the folks that couldnt get it in time well do our best to try to get the application back onto the appstore if at all possible
205580 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
205581 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
205582 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
205583 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
205584 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
205585 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
205586 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
205587 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
205588 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
205589 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
205590 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
205591 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
205592 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen
205593 there is a community of people who arent watching cnn or reading
205594 everybody came out here together and its something ive always liked about haddonfield
205595 there is a sense of community here and you are always representing more than yourself
205596 my goals right now are to take it one round at a time get to the final in beijing and go from there
205597 im in good shape right now and i think im ready to run faster than 4 05
205598 i would definitely like to run a four flat or better in the next few years and i intend to keep competing through the next olympics
205599 if you have the pc as your lead machine you have the problem of not knowing what configurations people have how many gigs of ram or what graphics card they have
205600 obviously we are more familiar with the xbox because we are familiar and the other thing is that the xbox is much easier to take to tech shows
205601 we can just pop the hard drive off the xbox and put it on any machine which is an advantage taking the pc or ps3 to these things just isnt convenient
205602 when i say exclusive i mean it is exclusive to just the xbox 360
205603 if you want to play the fallout 3 downloadable content you will need to have an xbox 360 or a pc
205604 we didnt buy the fallout franchise to just do fallout 3 and then stop
205605 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
205606 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
205607 there is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link iraq with last falls anthrax terrorism

205610 testing of its usefulness in crowded and other conditions and how non users react to the device is to be carried out in 2009 at the tressa yokohama shopping complex in yokohama city
205611 i dont think media sites such as youtube flickr etc will react or should react with surprise
205612 as the report states the internet represents huge opportunity and risk and whilst the internet brings with it some positive advantages it has done so at the cost of negative consequences to children and also to copyright owners
205613 it would have only been a matter of time before the above named sites and similar others would have come under fire for the kind of content they host albeit complicated by the fact that they are user generated content
205614 last week leading isps bt carphone warehouse virgin bskyb orange and tiscali accepted responsibility to work together with the government on illegal file sharing to protect right holders by writing to 1 000 infringing subscribers a week for a three month trial period
205615 in the same vein children should also be protected and it should come as no surprise that the government is recommending pro active review of content for sites hosting user generated content
205616 since the dawn of the new millennium there have been growing concerns surrounding children through their exposure to technology particularly to the internet
205617 recognising the potential of the serious harm internet sites chat rooms for example could pose the uk went on to enforce the sexual offences act 2003 and the effects of this law enforcement has been successful
205618 however in the context of media sites i am not very sure whether statutory regulation is the answer for two reasons practical and enforcement
205619 we knew wed have to take down that scrabble rip off eventually
205620 the talk that he will be tried as a terrorist has left me concerned
205621 you can look online at what hes been accused of and what the recommended sentences are
205622 they dont have to stick to those sentences but they are used as guidelines
205623 i think the representation of guantanamo bay and the 60 year sentences are the figment of someones imagination

205629 if were uncertain which direction to go with revisions we might test the waters with just one to three editors to start with so we can try a different version if needed
205630 i think its a good illustration of how capricious and gut level publishing decisions can be
205631 greenhouse is a new literary agency with a difference we exclusively represent and manage the careers of authors writing fiction for children from first readers through middle grade to sophisticated teen fiction
205632 one commenter asked me to recommend ya titles that would give an adult a sense of the richness of the genre
205633 bray attended the university of texas austin graduating in 1988 with a degree in theatre and high hopes of a playwriting career
205634 its a relaxed fun and supportive community with no dues or obligations
205635 im beginning to work on my lineup for the 2010 edition which means im looking for a few debut authors and or illustrators to feature in my annual first books article
205636 theres a consequentiality to writing for young people that makes it immensely satisfying you see it when you run into them in person and find out that there are kids who read your book googled every aspect of it figured out how to replicate the best bits and have turned your story into a hobby
205637 founded on the principle of cultural authenticity just us books has helped pave the way for the diversity in childrens books we see today the black owned family run publisher has sold millions of books and given many black illustrators and authors including me their start in the field
205638 one way is to put your character into a life or death situation but what if you are telling a quieter story than that
205639 heres the thing the truth ive only recently realized i dont just want to be a published author i want to be a successful published author theres a difference you know a big difference
205640 roughly 3 8 million people nationwide between the ages of 18 and 24 are neither in school nor employed according to the national league of cities that translates to one in six adults in this age group

205642 i really like www agentquery com it lets you find agents that represent your genre take e subs and are members of aar
205643 all of the setting locations are real from the jesuit mission to the leper colony to the inquisitors office and most of the characters are based on real people from that time period i took the most artistic license with my main character calepino all we know about him from the archives is that he was an african translator who spoke 11 languages
205644 you mention that is important to list the name of the submissions editor however i am finding this piece of information extremely hard to find
205645 i would love to do some childrens ya or middle grade books about the middle east multicultural books are appearing about a variety of ethnicities but im not seeing them about middle easterners as much as id hoped
205646 ghahremani is interested in childrens ya or middle grade books about the middle east as well as graphic novels
205647 writing to me is a form of discovery i uncover the plot and the characters as i go along naturally this often results in a very messy first draft since i sometimes dont know where im going until half way in but thats what editing is for i write to find out the story once i have a completed draft then i outline
205648 i am a divorcee this will come as news however to my husband no really i have divorced an agent and like many divorcees both from their agents and their spouses i am so much the better for it so i do speak from experience here
205649 an exhibition of the best american picture book art of the last decade children should be seen the image of the child in american picture book art makes its west coast debut

205651 the vampire mythos seems to resonate with something deep in human nature sexuality for one thing why is it so powerful and how can the sub genre stay fresh
205652 how does writing for young adults differ from writing for adult readers our panelists discuss whether its harder easier or pretty much the same but with a different label
205653 the texas book festival typically presents between 175 180 authors some from texas and some from the united states and abroad the festivals author selection committee routinely selects authors who are published in the year the festival takes place but books published 18 months prior to the start of the festival are eligible
205654 id be very very surprised if any court would penalise a company for trying to moderate
205655 if the directive is making companies think like this then it should jolly well be changed
205656 weve essentially said that this stance is ludicrous in our report and i happen to know that the secretary of state is sympathetic to this area and accepts that something needs to be done
205657 we accept that there are going to be varying degrees of protection
205658 but if you look at somebody like myspace they said they were proud of telling their customers the lengths that they go to to ensure that unsuitable content is taken down so quickly
205659 someone like youtube probably cant check every submission and to an extent their current system works but just because you cant check everything doesnt mean you shouldnt check anything
205660 the biggest recommendation we made was that the companies which currently all have their own rules
205661 this is malcolm x someone against white disgruntled not content
205662 i am not a racist in the past i permitted myself to be used to make sweeping indictments of all white people the entire white race and these generalizations have caused injuries to some whites who perhaps did not deserve to be hurt because of the spiritual enlightenment which i was blessed to receive as the result of my recent pilgrimage to the holy city of mecca i no longer subscribe to sweeping indictments of any one race i am now striving to live the life of a true sunni muslim i must repeat that i am not a racist nor do i subscribe to the tenets of racism i can state in all sincerity that i wish nothing but freedom justice and equality life liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all people
205663 un calo del 10 per cento alla stalla dallinizio del 2008 e un aumento dell11 1 per cento al consumo nellultimo anno luglio 2007 luglio 2008 il prezzo del latte segna un divario sempre pi accentuato tra la produzione e il dettaglio con incrementi che nei vari passaggi di filiera sino alla tavola arrivano anche al 300 per cento

205734 despite the undeniable potential of the chinese market it remains to be seen how the music industry can successfully capture the opportunity wawawa opens this huge new market to the independent sector for the first time with an offering that we believe is the right combination of convenience price and content selection for the increasingly adventurous chinese music fan
205735 with r2g and the wawawa weve found an ideal partner with the local industry knowledge experience and reputation needed for long term success
205736 ioda not only has a great catalog of quality music but also shares our belief that offering a wide selection of music at fair prices is what music fans in china ultimately want and that the market is ready for it
205737 in the current environment music knowledge is narrowly defined by whats made available through piracy this leaves music discovery to chance providing no guide for fans to connect with one another and share their passion for the artists they love r2gs partnership with ioda will change all that

205963 i was shocked that people in the neighborhood would complain about someone lifting their shirt up they made it sound like sodom and gomorrah
205964 i admit i was surprised by the results of our survey because to be honest i expected most people to say they lied about their age or their educational qualifications
205965 people must feel pretty ashamed of their financial situation or how much they drink or smoke if they feel the need to lie about it these are really important things and honesty between people is really very important for relationships to survive and develop

205972 for the moment the iranian response has not been clear enough
205973 we hit another low note every day from this campaign
205974 maybe the mccain campaign has decided they cant win the election based on the direction they are offering the country substantively
205975 few would doubt the fact that weve got multiple crises unfolding
205976 and i dont think these kinds of comments and innuendos have any place in a presidential campaign of this importance
205977 in kenya its not a rich cricketing nation in terms of whats available but we have to make the best of what little is available for example when we come here and see this magnificent structure for nets we dont have that every time we want a net its a manual operation for a couple of guys to erect some nets with old wooden poles theres nothing permanent theres always a procedure to be done
205978 there was a nice platform but it all went down one of my roles is to get us back to that level in 2003 im not talking about being a semi finalist but regularly beating the associates which hasnt happened countries like ireland and scotland have closed the gap we need to win the twenty20 qualifier and the intercontinental cup and we need to beat a test nation at next years world cup
205979 it allows smaller opposition a better chance of winning a game all these guys can hit the ball as well as test team players can and maybe its the day it comes off
205980 lesser opposition have a greater chance im talking about quality when i say that twenty20 is a nice arena for us to compete in obviously the skills are still in their infancy the various skills required are going improve as time goes on and perhaps at that stage test nations will widen the gap again
205981 im a traditionalist and the proper version of cricket is three four or five days long
205982 i would also love to see a two division system with promotion and relegation in test cricket and have a yearly championship the bottom nation in the first division gets relegated and the top side in the second get promoted something along those lines would give the associates a chance to play the best
205983 the icc have pumped money into getting their coaching and high performance programmes in place but id like them to put someone in charge of the administration of cricket in associate countries the cricketing people doing the admin love the game which is fine but we need to professionalise that side of the set up too the people running it dont always have the time or the knowledge and thats no disrespect to those in charge for getting structures in place getting the admin role of things up to the standard to which it can support the players is vital
205984 since christmas when i first started putting together a serious program to try to race nascar i thought about the possibility of racing here
205985 now that the opportunity has come im very excited about it
205986 its very important to me personally because i live here and ive raced here for many years on a track that has my fathers name its also important in terms of my goal to continue in racing and for me thats in nascar

205996 the sky done clouded over after glory fckn suns debut album yielding this brooding and corrosive follow up the new zealand sorta super group of antony milton ben spiers and simon ororke concoct a slow burning behemoth of metallic shivers and distortion churn dark enough to invoke the dread name haino spectra is an unsettling mind meld spiers desolate soundscapes bleed into miltons heavy drones which are complemented perfectly by ororkes restless percussion group improvisation is the natural language of these three even listing their solo and collaborative albums over the past decade would take way more effort than i can muster suffice to say this is a stellar and unique record to add to their massive discographies
205997 the fourth album by the sample sculptor of finlands oulu features only one long piece of sound slowly and ponderously developing sound mass moves between minimalist ambient and melodic sequences both beautiful and mentally jarring it is both organic and spacy almost at the same time

206008 portlands tone wrangler aaron davis aka acre has been blasting the world with his massive but barely there feedback swells for quite some time with releases on black horizons jk and more his first lp offering brings about the acre essence quite well massive walls of shoe gazed feedback are some how tamed into smooth quintessential drones this is not the sound of synthesizers or keyboards but a single tone being modified and replicated into a monolithic piece stasis so strong it is hard to realize the power of these two side long tracks until they end forcing silence back upon the listener direct hypnosis and transcendental zoning
206009 spirited youth and the intense magnification of focused energies chart the recent zones for treetops

206023 richard skelton presides over every aspect of the beautifully presented releases on his sustain release label a project initiated in memorandum to his wife louise the weight of which can be felt in all that skelton produces from the hand crafted and personalised edition of one cd s featuring louise s photographs of the surrounding lancashire landscape to the heartfelt and considered music contained within firstperson is very proud to be the first to release skelton s music outside of his own label a trend that will continue with future releases on students of decay amongst others for this release we are treated to a slowly unfolding meditation on the sonorities of the violin an elegiac and minimalistic rendition in the mould of arvo part or anton batagov this is music of substance that lingers long after it recedes into silence
206024 tapping into his french heritage through the work of the musique concrete pioneers maxime primault uses the world around him as his source material the results are first rate exercises in electro acoustic manipulation in which tones are shaped and matched to produce attenuated and considered drone studies primault also takes time out to run the crier dans les mus es label notable for the compilation cris et chuchotements featuring likeminded artists such as peter wright valerio cosi kuupuu and ghost brames of the cerfs
206025 fraser burnett has quietly built up an assured reputation for consistent and solid releases for labels such as lee stokoe s matching head blackest rainbow recently sharing a split lp with culver and his own pjorn imprint in an overcrowded genre sitting through another slab of drone music can sometimes feel like a laborious and thankless task however what works for me in this instance is the utter sincerity with which each release arrives i get the impression that none of this music is forced no hip references or longing to be part of it whatever the fuck it is seven tracks of subtle brain melt that could easily stretch to an hour each a canny tactic that has you reaching for the play button as soon as it s over
206026 welcome to the world of marky loo loo along with phil todd ashtray navigations and joincey stuckometer puff loo loo was an integral element in the majority of the outfits to evolve from the stoke on trent noise tape underground of the 90s his list of projects during this period is exhaustive with phil todd he birthed the all out electronic noise of dogliveroil and with the addition of joincey they formed the ultimate noise rock power trio target shoppers famously sharing a split 7 with melt banana as far back as 1995 other notable outings included turps with prince tun hock with joincey jaundice bogbush cosmos front door enemy the delightfully named i am not sitting next to you he who farts like loud water not to mention his inimitable contributions to the live ensembles tea culture and boit unique and his ill fated foray into magazine publication with warm heart wet arse the subs began around the start of the 90s as a project conceived entirely on the amiga 500 in order to reflect loo loo s combined love of electro pop a la the army of lovers obscure japanese anime the film music of john carpenter bootsy collins and death metal enlisting the help of paula hayes on shared vocals the carpenters for the 90s as one gig flyer read they released the 17 song cassette going like the clappers on phil todd s betley welcomes careful drivers label including such instant pop classics as qwerty and i have a key they also contributed to the infamous 7 x 7 box set released by stomach ache their track snow in my pocket depicted a love affair with a snowman that could only end in disaster their finest moment however was the release of the legendary and possibly their finest song leg in heart as a split lathe cut 7 with inca eyeball who also covered the song on the quattros symbolos cd for spirit of orr criminally limited to a mere 25 copies as part of this latest set of songs we at firstperson are more than a little proud to present the aforementioned leg in heart in its original form with vocals by loo loo himself the release of this current slim selection from a back catalogue totalling around 400 songs is the result of a personal quest by firstperson to see in print in one form or another once more the utterly original vision of marky loo loo you are welcome
206027 the end of the firstperson label comes in the form of the third release for fp from phil todd s psychedelic behemoth ensemble two tracks of shortwave static low end rumble and searing guitar pyrotechnics from possibly the most consistently on form artist the uk underground has produced it is fitting that the last release should come from todd whose betley welcomes careful drivers imprint and rigid commitment to a sustained and formidable work ethic formed an early and undeniable influence

206163 this decision has been taken following representations that have been made both to the attorney general and the director concerning the need to safeguard national and international security it has been necessary to balance the need to maintain the rule of law against the wider public interest no weight has been given to commercial interests or to the national economic interest
206164 that continuation of the investigation would cause serious damage to uk saudi security intelligence and diplomatic cooperation which is likely to have seriously negative consequences for the uk public interest in terms of both national security and our highest priority foreign policy objectives in the middle east

206232 the collective effect of these restrictions is to make any meaningful participation by the aclu impossible indeed allowing third parties to use this court as a general forum to present facial challenges to the governments surveillance activities could cause a flood of litigation that would district this court from its important national security functions
206233 if the governments request is granted the court wont hear arguments from anyone except the government and those arguments will be presented to the court in secret briefs especially because the new surveillance law departs so significantly from the standards that have applied to government surveillance for the last 30 years any proceedings relating to the new laws constitutionality should be adversarial and as informed and transparent as possible

206240 that aide monica m goodling exercised what amounted to veto power over a wide range of critical jobs asking candidates for their views ion and same sex marriage and maneuvering around senior officials who outranked her including the departments second in command the report concluded yesterday that goodling and others had broken civil service laws run afoul of department policy and engaged in misconduct a finding that could expose them to further scrutiny and sanctions
206241 nor is it the work of a few bad individuals
206242 the conservatism that speaks to us through its actions in washington is institutionally opposed to those baseline good intentions we learned about in elementary school its leaders laugh off the idea of the public interest as airy fairy nonsense they caution against bringing top notch talent into government service they declare war on public workers they have made a cult of outsourcing and privatizing they have wrecked established federal operations because they disagree with them and they have deliberately piled up an everest of debt in order to force the government into crisis the ruination they have wrought has been thorough it has been a professional job repairing it will require years of political action
206243 we are a free and sovereign people we govern ourselves and the government is ours but that is the point we are responsible not our leaders since we follow them we let them divert our loyalty from the united states to some party we let them boss the party and turn our municipal democracies into autocracies and our republican nation into a plutocracy we cheat our government and we let our leaders loot it and we let them wheedle and bribe our sovereignty from us

206246 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
206247 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
206248 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
206249 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
206250 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
206251 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
206252 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
206253 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
206254 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
206255 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
206256 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
206257 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
206258 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
206259 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
206260 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
206261 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
206262 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
206263 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
206264 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
206265 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
206266 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
206267 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
206268 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
206269 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
206270 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
206271 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
206272 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
206273 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
206274 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
206275 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
206276 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
206277 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
206278 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
206279 secret swift and extraordinary buildup of communist missiles in an area well known to have a special and historical relationship to the united states and the nations of the western hemisphere
206280 as far north as hudson bay canada and as far south as lima peru
206281 to regard any nuclear missile launched from cuba against any nation in the western hemisphere as an attack on the united states requiring a full retaliatory response upon the soviet union
206282 my fellow citizens let no one doubt that this is a difficult and dangerous effort on which we have set out
206283 as powerful as a joe louis jab to the solar plexus
206284 up river man made sites of interest on the hudson from the battery to troy
206285 the hudsons been both a pastoral landscape and an industrialized one
206286 its that interaction that makes it such a rich chaotic and interesting place its a microcosm of the entire history of american environmentalism landscape romanticism and industrialization played out more intensely here than anywhere i can think of
206287 in those days a lot of people did things just because they could he loved the idea of it
206288 there were just mounds of weeds poison ivy locusts there were little trails that led out to this point but the point at high tide was full of water at low tide it was the exposed stumps of pilings and a lot of industrial refuse

206296 we heard last night that that was the result we have now asked for the counter analysis b sample
206297 vaya al punto de partida ya no es necesario que salgamos a carretera
206298 todays satellite image technology means that even in todays desert complete privacy does not exist in any event plaintiffs live far from the desert and are far from hermits
206299 google is being somewhat hypocritical here as the company says that it takes privacy very seriously indeed when in almost the same breath it feels it can argue that privacy doesnt actually exist
206300 what is crucial here is that the us should completely abandon its hostile policy but the us is not yet prepared to make a strategic decision
206301 as we have stressed several times our nuclear armed force is a self defensive measure to protect the security of our country and people against manoeuvres by hostile forces to stifle the dprk north korea
206302 i think its ridiculous that karl rove thinks that he doesnt have to follow the law
206303 how many babies do i need to have before they let me keep one
206304 we have a war with many veterans who suffer some from spinal cord injuries or paralysis
206305 sworn to nonviolent direct action trying to save peoples homes
206306 if we could delay the bulldozers even for a few hours theyd send the crews home and that would be one day of no buildings being torn down
206307 we were trying to build momentum of people stopping the bulldozers every day
206308 the housing couldnt have been very critical if they were trying to destroy it
206309 i got out at 4 00 in the morning and tried to get into city hall for the vote
206310 they felt like if people were going to be facing terrorism charges and the police were tasering people and torturing people they had to back down
206311 the city doesnt know where they are people evicted because of a storm should be able to come back to their own homes and their own community instead a political decision is being made under the excuse of a natural disaster
206312 it would have been nice to save the buildings but what weve always been about is that every citizen of new orleans displaced by that storm has the right to come back and if theyre not allowed to come back theyve essentially become refugees in their own country and thats not right its not what our country should be about
206313 i can only say that american beef is safe and that we hope in time the south korean people will listen to that and will be willing to listen to what their government is saying and what we are saying
206314 why the hell would they do that listen i mean
206315 the us and korea alliance is a critical issue in korea
206316 to evolve better forms of democracy that involve more people through the mediation of technology
206317 you need to be able to influence the political apparatus in a democracy in order to have a long term influence
206318 ten million people that amounts to the half of north koreas population suffer from food shortages and among those ten million about 3 million people are in danger of starvation
206319 they help when they become aware of severe famine in north korea but most of them do not know what is going on there they seem to be way too busy with their own lives and are reminded of nuclear weapons programs first when it comes to north korea
206320 the demonstration is okay if it is done in the proper manner with permission not in the middle of the street stopping cars and causing problems
206321 because the president has been lying about the great canal and american beef
206322 over the course of the candlelight protest movement there have been cases of indiscriminate detention arrest suppression of free expression on the internet and other abuses of human rights
206323 the total emissions rate for oil and gas fuels is about 27 pounds of carbon dioxide per gallon counting both production and use
206324 t he estimated total emissions from coal derived fuel is more like 50 pounds of carbon dioxide per gallon nearly twice as much
206325 senator obama supports investing in technology that could make coal a clean burning source of energy
206326 however unless and until this technology is perfected senator obama will not support the development of any coal to liquid fuels unless they emit at least 20 percent less life cycle carbon than conventional fuels
206327 illinois basin coal has more untapped energy potential than the oil reserves of saudi arabia and kuwait combined senator obama believes it is crucial that we invest in technologies to use these resources to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
206328 obama will significantly increase the resources devoted to the commercialization and deployment of low carbon coal technologies obama will consider whatever policy tools are necessary including standards that ban new traditional coal facilities to ensure that we move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology

206336 im not going to take off my underwear there is an embassy waiting outside for me
206337 i know that there is an embassy waiting for you take off your underwear
206338 im not going to take it off because this is a humiliation youre trying to humiliate me its not security checking because i went through the security system like anyone else and you are treating me differently
206339 im not going to move right or left im totally naked
206340 why do you treat me that way im a human being and i dont deserve this kind of treatment
206341 well still you have seen nothing you will see more
206342 im emotionally destroyed i have nightmares i have never experienced such humiliation they stripped and made fun of me if i werent a palestinian if only i had a different passport they would never have done that to me
206343 the person in question received decent treatment and no extraordinary measures were taken against him after the body search the person in question lost his balance and fell for some unknown reason
206344 every day he reports from a war zone where he is also a prisoner his homeland gaza is surrounded starved attacked forgotten he is a profoundly humane witness to one of the great injustices of our time he is the voice of the voiceless

206355 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
206356 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
206357 not only do we tell users the phases of the sales cycle but we also tell them how to complete the sale effectively
206358 that lets the salesperson follow up in a timely manner when clients show interest
206359 its nice to see traditional crm merge with what we call sales knowledge management
206360 a lot of products take sales training and embed it into crm systems but for the most part these only tell a sales rep what to do get to the cio understand customer needs and so on
206361 i dont have all my sales collateral on the blackberry i still carry around my laptop with the data sheets and price sheets
206362 its not a good format for doing intense data sharing
206363 reasonable suspicion is not needed for customs officials to search a laptop or other personal electronic storage devices at the border
206364 you almost hit me back there i was behind you as you backed up and had the slam on the gas to avoid a collision
206365 well that is why i am telling you i thought you should know what almost happened maybe that will teach you that its not a good idea to back up on major roads
206366 minutemen have a right to free speech but not on the steps of sanfran courthouse
206367 if the govt wont protect the people from these invaders americans will have to deal with them
206368 the dropoff in illegal immigration seems to occur before there is a runup in their unemployment rate
206369 from may to april 2007 there is an actual uptick in the number of illegals in the country which falls off after the legislation fails it seems as if the discussion of legalization had some effect on the decision to come or go or both
206370 the problem is its difficult to know whats causing a change like this
206371 but the one thing we know for sure is that the country is in a deep economic downturn if not a recession which means theres much less need for workers especially those providing services for the middle class
206372 immigration is a market driven phenomenon and thats why immigration is beneficial to the economy
206373 when we need them they come and when we dont they go home has enforcement had some effect perhaps but theres no question that the economic downturn would in and of itself have a huge effect in attracting fewer illegal immigrants and sending more home
206374 weve seen a turn of the tide in terms of illegal immigration
206375 without doubt people have left and without question fewer people are coming
206376 a lot of people doing the recruiting are friends uncles cousins relatives people crossing the border may not know what kind of work they will be doing but they know its work and theres somebody at the other end making the arrangement
206377 as ive said for years the migrants on the south side of chicago know more about the economy than the us labor department
206378 this in turn could create the illusion that the illegal population is falling when in fact the population remains unchanged
206379 the economy certainly influences immigration but thats not to say that enforcement doesnt also influence immigration
206380 tamar jacoby president of immigrationworks usa an organization of employers nationwide lobbying for comprehensive immigration reform
206381 a pew study found that there is an annual need for 500 000 unskilled foreign workers in this country but for some unknown reason only 5 000 visas are issued each year to unskilled workers
206382 as immigrants in america we found freedom and opportunity we fully understand the pain and suffering which immigrants are going through in building better lives
206383 we are committed to follow all federal state and local regulations in our plant

206385 the grocery industry didnt convince the american consumer that maximum return on stimulus checks could be achieved right in the supermarket aisles the average family of fours 1 800 rebate equates to about three months of grocery buying a prime opportunity for stores to influence shopping behavior
206386 george is one of the best senators best elected officials ive ever met quite honestly in my opinion its a democracy but he should be running unopposed with what hes doing for his community for his district
206387 our life is not exactly the way we want it but im absolutely confident that george will be re elected overwhelmingly because hes earned it
206388 hes earned it and hes deserved it with all his years of positive representation in albany
206389 strangely in setting up sen skelos visit sen george winner and county executive tom santulli all republicans opted not to include the city its mayor and city manager and the 30 000 people they represent
206390 i would have hoped sen skelos would want to hear from as many community leaders as possible this is a missed opportunity for elmirans indeed
206391 surely a meeting in the county executives office a mere two blocks from city hall is an official meeting and not a political one
206392 this kind of visit and chance to have in person discussions on key issues is so important the city would have made every effort to have representation present for this event had we received an invitation
206393 had we been part of the meeting we would have discussed such important issues as lagging state funding to cities the rapid decline of urban manufacturing costly and inaccessible health care high taxes struggling schools and other issues important to elmirans and all new yorkers
206394 wir m ssen heute abend etwas arbeit erledigen um zu verstehen und herauszuarbeiten wo wir aus dem auto mehr geschwindigkeit herausholen k nnen
206395 in bezug auf die anzahl der gefahrenen runden haben wir eine gute distanz abgespult aber es w re immer sch n etwas schneller zu sein wir werden morgen zur ckkehren und unser bestes geben
206396 es war ein anderes problem als heute morgen aber mit dem gleichen ende
206397 wir hatten ein problem mit der kupplung leider ist uns das ventil fl ten gegangen deswegen hatten wir keine m glichkeit mehr das w hrend der session rechtzeitig zu reparieren es kann auch einen zusammenhang mit heute morgen geben das m ssen wir uns aber erst anschauen wir m ssen analysieren wie es dazu kommen konnte und die betroffenen teile austauschen
206398 ich kann sowieso nichts tun als auf das dritte freie training zu hoffen
206399 die trainings sind die einzige gelegenheit zeit auf der strecke zu verbringen auf der man das rennen f hrt diese zeit fehlt uns heute daher ist die arbeit des teamkollegen doppelt so wichtig mal schauen was bei ihm rausgekommen ist wie er sich f hlt dann werden wir f r morgen alles anpassen ich kann sowieso nichts tun als auf das dritte freie training zu hoffen

206401 man muss einen rhythmus und eine linie finden das fehlt schon auch die daten wie sehr es ins gewicht geht das werden wir morgen sehen
206402 ich bin nur neun runden gefahren da kann ich dazu wirklich nichts sagen
206403 wir haben uns ganz auf die abstimmung f r das rennen konzentriert
206404 das war buchst blich in letzter sekunde aber ich war mir sicher dass es klappen k nnte gestern hatten viele leute probleme mit den verschiedenen vorf llen ich auch das auto war gestern schon gut ich konnte das aber nicht umsetzen heute brachte ich alles zusammen das hat den unterschied ausgemacht
206405 sollten wir keine probleme bekommen dann k nnen wir gut abschneiden wir hatten allerdings schon einige schwierigkeiten f r uns w re ein gutes ergebnis eine prima sache aber es wird verdammt hart den sieg zu holen die konkurrenz ist unglaublich gut

206407 the world had inflicted a terrible injustice upon the palestinian people in 1947 1948 there would be no peace in the middle east until this injustice was somehow rectified and the palestinian people were certainly entitled to an independent nation state of their own
206408 you will forfeit the moral right to lead your people
206409 proclaimed the existence of the new independent state of palestine
206410 the real start of the middle east peace process by the palestinian people themselves
206411 administered under the laws of the mandatory as integral portions of its territory
206412 the palestinian people proceed forthwith to create the state of palestine
206413 in recognition of the courage suffering and bravery of the palestinian people living under israeli occupation
206414 the threat or use of force violence and intimidation against its territorial integrity and political independence or those of any other state
206415 occupied territory and hence subject to the provisions of international law governing the rights and obligations of an occupying power
206416 the failure of israel to respect the previous resolutions by the un regarding the status of the city of jerusalem
206417 all legislative and administrative actions taken by israel to change jerusalems status are totally invalid and
206418 jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the state of israel
206419 us embassy in israel should be established in jerusalem no later than may 31 1999
206420 they are not and could never be honest brokers for peace
206421 just and lasting middle east peace and withdrawal of israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict
206422 if however the power of the occupier is effectively displaced for any length of time its position towards the inhabitants is the same as before occupation
206423 but do not sell out our right to our state
206424 prove that the palestinians were willing to live in peace and harmony with israel
206425 deplores the provocation carried out at al haram al sharif and subsequent violence
206426 calls upon israel the occupying power to abide scrupulously by its legal obligations and its responsibilities under the fourth geneva convention
206427 terrorism originates from the statist system of structural violence and domination that denies the right of self determination to peoples
206428 right of individual or collective self defense if an armed attack occurs against a member until the security council has taken measures to maintain international peace and security
206429 sole rogue elephant of international law and politics for humanitys sake this administration must be restrained along with its israeli partner time is of the essence
206430 a severe defeat for israel in the court of world public opinion
206431 punitive repressive vindictive and retaliatory tactics including criminal prosecutions and student disciplinary
206432 good parenting and were encouraged to use at home the skills they had been taught they also attended discussion groups with between 10 and 15 other parents
206433 this study provides substantial evidence that these programmes can be rolled out effectively across a large number of local authorities there is now considerable evidence to suggest that such programmes do have benefits in improving antisocial behaviour in children and the psychological and social functioning of parents
206434 all local authorities were aware of this as a problem and related it to the timing of the courses parent being seen to mean mother and a lack of men running the classes
206435 fathers perhaps feel a bit inhibited by parenting courses particular efforts need to be made to address this
206436 really useful but particularly when the course is finished so that if i feel myself slipping or old behaviours are coming back i can look to it
206437 quntar says the child was killed in a crossfire by the sea i dont believe him and i dont defend him but neither do i believe the version of the israeli army it has always killed children and lied

206446 t here was a consensus in the media that they had to push the peace process all the way
206447 media bias is one of the controversial issues in communications research
206448 twisted events according to their ideology and point of view
206449 in the broadcast media they select interviewees and participants in talk shows and panel discussions and allocate time in minutes to each thus in order to detect bias it is necessary to identify the political beliefs of participants and to measure the time in minutes allocated to each
206450 it has a lot of influence on the politicians the high commanders in the army and the reaction to our enemies

206530 while we are naturally disappointed to see british airways suspend their services having had close dialogue with them throughout we understand the circumstances

206533 plastics packaging waste in particular is a very visible part of the waste stream and its also growing
206534 ironically as we become more successful at recycling generally whats left in the bin tends to be just the plastic so more and more people are looking in their bins and saying theres just bits of plastic here why cant i recycle them
206535 a lot of packaging is designed to lengthen the shelf life of the products that are being sold so if you take it out of the packaging theres a good chance that it will actually not last as long
206536 and unless youre very very disciplined and most of us frankly arent then youre quite likely to end up by throwing more food away

206542 then several months ago we heard the owners were trying to sell it
206543 we knew they would never sell it to us but a third party who does not want to be identified offered to buy it for us just before noon tuesday we closed on the property and the keys were turned over to us they former cafe risque owners wont find out until today who really bought it
206544 alienates anglicans from the orthodox church and contributes to further division of the christian world
206545 such a practice contradicts centuries old church traditions dating back to the first christian community orthodox christians consider women bishops to be even more unacceptable
206546 to arrest and jail protesters for raising a separatist flag appears to me to be a disproportionate reaction
206547 are true those actions are to be denounced in the strongest possible terms
206548 the army does not allow or condone any form of physical activity to be used for disciplinary purposes
206549 commanding officers are made fully aware of their responsibility to protect their soldiers from all forms of physical and mental harassment or intimidation and any suspicion of bullying is dealt with immediately
206550 this sort of activity should not be condoned and mustnt be allowed to happen again

206559 id like to thank mayor harding and the city of woodstock for their leadership in initiating this event and for challenging municipalities to do better every year
206560 the blackout of 2003 is a tangible reminder of how important electricity is to all of us on a daily basis
206561 the anniversary should remind us all to be more aware of our energy consumption and not to take electricity for granted we all need to do our part to conserve
206562 city staff are keen to get involved in the community initiative we plan to implement energy conservation measures throughout our city facilities during the challenge without impacting day to day operation and occupants safety

206613 for too many years ownership did not spend big money that is amounts above the recommendations of the commissioners office in the draft the phils have also come up short in spending in latin america last year they spent 850 000 in latin america this year about 1 5 million according to multiple sources both totals were near the bottom among major league teams the reduced flow of top young talent into a system can hamstring a team when it needs to make a trade that might be the difference in winning a championship

206633 the proxy fight is over and it will not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose
206634 ive been fortunate enough to be in florida over the last four years its something that i think has given me the base to prepare myself for this opportunity working closely with gerry fleming and doing the everyday regimen of coaching in the echl i think has certainly helped me in my career
206635 obviously things happen for a reason i was treated very well by the organization president and gm craig brush was a great mentor to me as well along with gerry decisions are made for different reasons craig obviously went with malcolm cameron for me to sit back and say im disappointed wouldnt be fair what theyve given me allowed me to go i think it was good for me to go and venture my own path im looking forward to doing that in reading
206636 the fans are passionate about their team which is exciting theres a lot of parity between the everblades and reading florida also has a good strong base theyre very passionate there my time spent in reading last week i could see the passion and excitement of the fans its a fun atmosphere to be a part of
206637 gerry and i have become pretty good friends even away from the rink and i think thats transcended into our working relationship at the rink hes someone who was very willing to allow me to be involved in all areas of the team because of our relationship it helped me getting that comfort level of working in the echl
206638 you always want to use what the organization has created and built
206639 theyve done a good job in reading to be a very competitive team theyve certainly produced a lot of players to the next level the call ups are also a positive because its a place where a lot of young players feel that the opportunity to get to the next level serves them well in the northeast youre closer to the american league teams you want to use that to entice players to come over
206640 the one thing you hear about reading is its a place with a lot of movement with respect to being so close a lot of american league teams
206641 ive had some experience with that in florida with our two affiliations in carolina and the florida panthers
206642 hopefully that experience will allow me to deal with the movement that is certainly frequent with the reading royals i think thats something that ill certainly keep a close eye on im open to the fact that it happens a lot in reading you just try to prepare for it and deal with it the best you can

206649 the oems give us predictions as to when theyll ship the devices and i dont want to put them in the dunk tank if thats a phrase by implying that they didnt stay on time thats confidential conversations that we have
206650 the essence of the liberal outlook lies not in what opinions are held but in how they are held instead of being held dogmatically they are held tentatively and with a consciousness that new evidence may at any moment lead to their abandonment

206707 laptops are currently being lost by organisations with such alarming frequency that many now claim they should be banned from holding sensitive data at all seriously inhibiting the benefits of working remotely
206708 precious few laptops are ever successfully located so it makes sense for firms to examine alternative means of safeguarding the data by deploying solutions that are capable of monitoring managing and if necessary killing laptops irrespective of their location or status
206709 technology now exists that can lock down laptops even if theyre switched off meaning theres really no excuse for losing sensitive details in this manner

206872 i truly feel we are in for a long haul when it comes to this recession there is still alot of truth telling that needs to come to the market and the consumer will bear the results
206873 until housing regains its footing the economy is a house on sinking sand
206874 this isnt like your dads recession this is a whole new ballgame the mbas have outsourced so many jobs that there is nothing left to manufacture to turn this economy around
206875 basically this country needs to make stuff look at all the emerging and solid economies around the world show me one that is strictly an importer and doesnt manufacture stuff
206876 the economy is tanking everywhere i look nobody i know is spending like they used to which is a good thing and there is only one question left is this the great recession or the great depression
206877 it all depends upon consumer spending we wont recover from this for a least several years so dont hold your breath and try to call a bottom the bottom is a long way off and nobody knows how far down it will go yet

206883 the economic slump comprises industries that are slumping airlines autos homebuilding mortgages real estate etc and industries that are expanding agriculture energy health care mining technology etc the gains outnumber the losses so we get slow growth but the growth is slower than the rate of productivity gains so jobs are slowly shed
206884 this slump will eventually end and growth will return then some day well have another slump it goes on and on and on and on

206888 but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based president clinton was a force for unity in this country on this subject every american should be proud of his record as both a governor and president but we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united state of their own party
206889 i think the mccain camp watched our primary on the democratic side very carefully and they know that any accusation of racial divisiveness can be very very harmful for a candidates prospects

207016 we hope that foreign reporters while in china will respect our laws and rules report objectively and help communication and understanding between china and the peoples of the world
207017 the determining factor in securing the success of the olympic games is to work vigorously to promote the olympic spirit featuring friendship solidarity and peace
207018 the key is to ensure that athletes from all countries will have a level playing field to compete fairly
207019 we need to ensure that our friends from the five continents can further enhance their mutual understanding and deepen their friendship during the games
207020 so you can see that these terrorist groups are not that capable of instigating massive sabotage activities as some hostile forces hope to see
207021 to the beijing olympic games the biggest threat comes from the east turkistan terrorist organization
207022 these forces are trying all means to sabotage the beijing olympic games
207023 these terrorist groups are not as capable as some media organizations have claimed or broadcast
207024 our aim is to target the most critical points related to the olympics we will try to attack chinese central cities severely using the tactics that have never been employed
207025 we have always had an understanding and we havent necessarily talked about it that any sovereign government will block pornographic sites and what they might consider subversive or sites which are contrary to the national interest
207026 i would suggest also that we are not working in a democratic society were working in a communist society this is china and they are proud to be a communist society so it will be different
207027 i believe we are now on the way to getting there
207028 i just got the message early this morning that everything had opened up and im very happy about that
207029 and were keeping our promises when bidding for the games to provide good environment and a quality service for reporters using the internet to cover the olympic games and we administer the internet by law
207030 president bush has tried to hold a line across the board where it comes to this congress trying to raise taxes on the american people or raise spending he has not been afraided to veto bills
207031 someone who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing
207032 well he is moving out to california because his daughter is living up in a tree

207036 humour in primetime television is usually something straightforward with not so many surprises
207037 channel 10 even though its six years old is still kind of the new kid in town
207038 they are still fighting for their place for their positioning within the market that means they are more daring in their programming approach than the older more established commercial channel channel 2
207039 we are looking for partners either broadcasters or production companies that specialise in comedy
207040 they need to be able to come up with the right writers to do the local adaptation and the right actors so we are looking for partners that we can trust to bring the same level of quality in terms of the humour and the acting that we have here in israel
207041 were at the wrong address the partys at that house
207042 she goes into the other room and there is a very very sick child there with a doctor under intensive care
207043 this is the kind of contradiction that makes you laugh sometimes makes you think sometimes makes you shocked
207044 so youre always looking forward to what comes at the end
207045 you know when you deal with issues that are taboo there is always the risk that you might offend
207046 when the level of acting and the level of writing is so high i think it is a very worthwhile thing
207047 then they understand that although it is shocking because of the themes it deals with it is very well done very well directed and very witty and not low level humour
207048 its very sophisticated and very appealing to the wider audience
207049 the way armoza formats has been positioned in the market is that whatever kind of format clients see with us is not what they usually see in the market
207050 this format goes with our line of product which is quality and creativity beyond average
207051 when you came up the driveway we wanted a house that looked like it had been there from the beginning
207052 the cozy feeling of sleeping under a slanted roof and listening to the rain
207053 and it had to have a clothes chute like i had as a kid
207054 but the porch draws your eye to the ground giving the home an anchor so it doesnt feel overwhelmingly tall
207055 no matter where you look its pastoral with rolling hills flowers and nature
207056 i didnt want it to block the view or become a dominant part of the room

207065 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
207066 i enter into the position of international president with the deepest sense of obligation to the members who number better than 111 000 and their families i owe a huge debt of gratitude to tom short who made desperately needed institutional changes that will allow me to continue to build on a solid foundation we are well positioned to meet the challenges of the future

207069 the beauty in these briquettes is that they are made from what has been considered up to this point waste furthermore the material is available locally so there are virtually no transportation costs and once the burn characteristics of the briquettes are understood they burn very similarly to charcoal if introduced to the marketplace properly the presence of biomass briquettes should dramatically reduce the consumption of illegal forest charcoal thats good for mountain gorillas and people alike

207077 you can take your diploma walk off this stage and chase only after the big house and the nice suits and all the other things that our money culture says you should
207078 fulfilling your immediate wants and needs betrays a poverty of ambition

207080 thinking back on my recent comments at big east media day i believe that i may have overstated my feelings on college baseball and the wvu baseball program i have not played collegiate baseball in the past because i have concentrated on football and building on our success with my football family i am sorry my comments have caused so many distractions i am looking forward to putting this behind me and getting on the practice field with my teammates on saturday
207081 as for georgia several factors propelled its move up the rankings

207097 its the heart and soul of the food scene out here in the hamptons
207098 jeff salaway was a great inspiration for chefs for customers and for friends
207099 when i first started cooking here there was one farmer interested and if he showed up at 6 on friday night i was lucky
207100 we didnt know that word it was about what was fresh and great and that meant getting to know the farming community
207101 we pulled these radishes out of the ground this morning
207102 which is kind of cool because im tired of looking at my food
207103 another flaw in the human character is that everybody wants to build and nobody wants to do maintenance
207104 predatory lending practices including the purchase of interest only and other problematic loan products
207105 the act will provide virtually no benefit to at risk homeowners due to the restrictive underwriting and delayed implementation resulting in millions of homeowners losing their homes based on false promises the beneficiaries of the act will be the gses government sponsored entities i e fannie mae and freddie mac whose implicit taxpayer guarantee of 10 billion will become unlimited and may cost the taxpayer 800 billion and more it rewards the gses for their past failures and supports them in continuing these practices congress and the administration never asked two fundamental questions 1 when would hud be able to implement the new hope for homeowners program and 2 are the gses continuing the lending practices that were instrumental in causing the mortgage crisis
207106 if the moratorium on offshore drilling were lifted today it would be 2030 before wed see a noticeable effect on supply and prices
207107 the notion that obama is singlehandedly or to any significant degree or more than most other senators to blame for the high cost of gas is absurd in too many ways to count here obama has been in the senate only since 2005 mccain himself said earlier this month that the problem has been decades in the making

207112 the principle of minimation can be roughly stated thus it is better to find a non technological solution than a technological one or failing that a less technological solution than a more technological one there are at least three reasons for this first a modern automatic machine is no mere inert tool it is a complex fuel consuming being with needs of its own it gobbles up energy it demands care and maintenance it even has bouts of temperament in many cases no diaper will contain its mess and all this on top of the initial chunk of cash it bites its purchase price which often amounts to a kings ransom for these reasons it not only serves but must be served but it is more than another mouth to feed as it becomes more involved and involving it can easily invade the living space we formerly reserved for ourselves taking on functions once our own this brings us to a second and more critical reason for minimation avoiding usurpation to cater to an inanimate objects needs is one thing to aid and abet in our own replacement is another duplicating vital human capacities can have one of only two consequences atrophying the capacities or creating competition between homo sapiens and machine neither of these is savory to self respecting members of the former this is not to mention the wasted use of resources or the often superior artistry elegance or efficiency of human powers or processes my emphasis the third reason for minimation is recalling the need or end in view a complex mechanical entity readily overwhelms or subverts the very purpose for which it was deployed this is because of its sheer immensity and the many unforeseen consequences that such a thing may bring about blind to this pitfall the participants in our automobile culture continue to propagate cars freeways sprawl and development that as ivan illich pointed out when hidden costs labors and time are added in leave us moving no faster and possibly less fast than we were one hundred years ago in horse drawn vehicles
207113 price declines are occurring in areas where subprime lending was heavily concentrated and a large percentage of sales are foreclosure sales
207114 those sales are always significantly lower than transactions that are not forced
207115 we are making progress although not in a straight line
207116 housing continues to be at the heart of our economic challenges and remains our most significant downside risk

207126 the middle east is not going to get better without the creation of a palestinian state to live side by side with israel in peace security and democracy
207127 it simply isnt going to get better and so the question is if not now when
207128 theyre all committed to trying to make it happen but nobody should underestimate the difficulty
207129 the issues are difficult and theyve always been difficult theres nothing surprising in that
207130 no amount of american or international or regional support will help them unless they have bought into it and so thats really the idea that underpins rices style of helping the process along

207140 we bought a drink from inside the stadium before the game and went out on to the training pitch so some of us could have a cigarette
207141 i did as he said but a few minutes later he returned with two police officers who came over and took our names and addresses then they threw us out of the ground
207142 i spoke to the club afterwards and their argument was that they had let people know about the regulations two years ago but i havent been to a game there for ten years
207143 when smoking legislation came in last year we started a system of warning people about the restrictions it wasnt really adhered to properly by people so it was decided by the club that anybody actually caught smoking would be ejected from the ground
207144 this season there are public announcements to that effect and we have 48 cctv cameras around the ground
207145 at the beginning of last season there were more than 200 instances of people smoking but that number dropped to between 40 and 60 towards the end of the season
207146 ipswich borough council has an enforcement body and the club is liable to a 2 500 fine
207147 we were treated like criminals i dont want anyone else to get thrown out without a warning like we did
207148 id trade everybody for little or no return mostly no return
207149 i dont want to do something that messes me up mentally
207150 i think people just dont realize that sometimes actors can really take it in and become that person
207151 this is our last time doing a movie together and we love each other so much
207152 we really grew up together we can be free when were around one another and the amount of fun we have is ridiculous

207165 well a bank hired us to sing in front of a big female orchestra and so i booked them they played wonderfully and we all had a great time in the green room so when the state theatre gigs came up i wanted to do something that would remind people of the sydney symphony shows we did last year
207166 its a very pleasant working environment and it means i not only get to cruise the audience but i can cruise the stage as well
207167 as for the album i dont think anyones going to say its too early for a best of its been 15 years and i feel proud of our output and that we were consistent enough to have three platinum albums in a row as opposed to the one hit wonder that i think a lot of people thought we were going to be im actually trying to slow down a little bit now
207168 it feels very natural to be taking a breath now im 43 im trying not to let work kill me because rocknroll kills people and im determined to meet my grandchildren
207169 i mean there are a lot of pictures here of my daughter alice and nobodys ever really known i have a daughter
207170 thank you ill show you her pictures later and so ill tell you all about that no one knows about it because i never really thought i had to put out a press release you know i mean i dont think i have to alert the press to the milestones of my life if i can manage to make a living without doing that then im a lucky man
207171 no never have been four years ago i had a very strong paternal instinct matched by a very strong instinct for freedom and so i had a child with a friend of mine i didnt necessarily see myself getting married but my friend and my whims just coincided and it happened really easily before we knew it we were co parenting a little girl called alice she lives on the northern beaches and i live here alice stays here two or three nights a week and i suppose that does tend to make you stop and smell the roses
207172 shes a little joy she just sings and dances and sleeps so we got lucky how many you got
207173 me too i havent been spreading my seed recklessly like the old rocknrollers the generation before me theyve been getting calls for 20 years from their bastard offspring from tamworth or narrabri and i started touring after the world of aids so managed to avoid that legacy
207174 its been a wonderful experience one always understands or appreciates ones parents more after ones had a child and those first 18 months
207175 its like a destructive relationship isnt it you cant wait until they get to your house and you cant wait until they leave
207176 but its all turned out really well i havent avoided telling anyone ive been going to the mothers group in newtown for the past 2 years with 65 women and four fathers ive been walking around newtown with a pram for three years but no one ever asked me so i enjoyed not having to talk about it because i dont know its great to be a private person who lives a normal life ive always viewed myself as such and im quite glad that no one knew until she was nearly four and i mean its time to tell now because weve got our first gig next week
207177 yeah the kindy rang up and said could you come and play piano for the kids and i said sure so alice and i have worked up a wonderful version of zippity doo dah so its her first concert and shes very excited about it says shes going to join the whitlams when she grows up and be a ballerina all very sweet
207178 yeah that was embarrassing ive never blushed so much in my life
207179 i was reading montaigne in paris this year when i came across this to conduct an embassy govern a people those are brilliant actions to scold laugh love hate and deal gently with ones family and oneself that is something rarer more difficult and less noticed by the world
207180 so to live life well and not necessarily in the public eye is just as much of a challenge really and you understand those challenges when you have a child because you know that everything every single little thing you do is about to get replicated and reflected in the next 40 years
207181 its great shell be showing it to someone in like 2080 and itll be like someone now showing you a shot of them with oscar wilde or proust or the like
207182 lasts a long time but burning desire two to three weeks
207183 i learnt from all of them or rather absorbed things they are special people these creative types but they conquered me with the simplicity and discipline with which they work if i had not learnt anything from them i would have been no better than a groupie
207184 i worried that it would be bad for my husband but i feel no shame for my past im proud of everything ive done its a picture that was originally taken for an anti aids campaign
207185 she was never one to run around from guy to guy
207186 they were long relationships two years three years always very intense she didnt marry sarkozy because she needs something i can tell you that shes got it all
207187 i give you my body my soul and my chrysanthemum
207188 my orgy my folly my blessed bread my charming prince
207189 i who always sought fire i am burning for you like a pagan woman
207190 if people dont listen because i married the president of the republic i understand

207194 if theres one word that sums up the churchs attitude to sex it would be wow
207195 it already has to some extent i go to a church where i can practise the sort of catholicism i believe was intended by vatican ii
207196 it welcomes gays and many of us would see a case for abortion for instance if it involved a young girl who had been raped i see no problem in that
207197 catholicism has always been a moveable feast things come and go and nobody minds were used to change years ago mary sometimes seemed more adored than jesus but these days you hardly hear of her possibly the women priest issue had something to do with that
207198 we raised our kids catholic but they went their own way they dont go to church but do think themselves catholic
207199 gen ys from conservative protestant denominations manifest much higher levels of religious belief and practise than catholics or anglicans

207291 despite the undeniable potential of the chinese market it remains to be seen how the music industry can successfully capture the opportunity wawawa opens this huge new market to the independent sector for the first time with an offering that we believe is the right combination of convenience price and content selection for the increasingly adventurous chinese music fan
207292 with r2g and the wawawa weve found an ideal partner with the local industry knowledge experience and reputation needed for long term success
207293 ioda not only has a great catalog of quality music but also shares our belief that offering a wide selection of music at fair prices is what music fans in china ultimately want and that the market is ready for it

207362 it wasnt like biodiesel didnt cause some of the problems but there were a lot of factors that year
207363 it reminds me of when ethanol first came in that was about the time the oil companies had to take lead out of the fuel so they were adding all kinds of things to get the octane back but ethanol got the blame when there were problems
207364 some of the problems had to do with biodiesel but a lot of things didnt

207399 you wish you had the dh we didnt plan in advance how to move things around
207400 the last three years since we have been in a better position our attitude has been to give our thought to what we have to do to be ready we feel like if we play up to our capabilities well win the ballgame
207401 i know where im supposed to go on cutoffs i probably always knew id go back over there and with todd out it was a pretty obvious move
207402 i dont think thats an easy transition being where hes been what hes gone through including time in the mexican league to get into that spot and have fun not make too much of it the human side is going to get involved
207403 we are in a spot where we are able to make a run at the division and if we can have a healthy jeff francis who can pick up where he left off last year that would be a huge shot in the arm
207404 we are talking about getting our no 1 pitcher back
207405 we need him back and we need him to be productive
207406 that was the plan when we sent him out its why we left him down there for that one more start to get him through the full cycle getting him using all of his pitches and get the confidence back
207407 it sounds like he has done all he can do now it is time to revisit the situation and bring him back here
207408 i think this shows our fan base and players that we are continually putting the emphasis on making the right decision at the right time
207409 we have confidence in the ability we have in our clubhouse theres still a lot of baseball to be played keeping fuentes is our best opportunity to play out and have a shot at making a run at it again
207410 we feel good about what we are capable of doing
207411 nobody in here wanted fuentes to go its a nice feeling to have him go out there in the ninth
207412 when you look at it on the final day the only pitcher who was dealt was a left handed reliever arthur rhodes
207413 there was a premium placed on the price of starting pitchers
207414 we should have jeff francis back next week so we have some help for the rotation on the way
207415 i have said all along i wanted to stay and now that the deadline has come and gone we can just worry about playing baseball and getting the job done
207416 a year ago the players also lobbied for the team to stand pat and the rockies did rally to claim the national league wild card and the first league pennant in franchise history
207417 do something even if it is wrong but do something
207418 ms spears is reluctantly agreeing to extend the temporary conservatorship
207419 just doing my job so give me a break im pushing you down but youve got what it takes
207420 dont lay back and do nothing try anything try something cause the winds that i blow and the storms that are near are my way of saying get over you fear
207421 live me and love but let life be taught with you and with others this fight i have fought sometimes i win sometimes i loose your chance to take what will you choose
207422 nope i havent even talked to my boss about it first so i cant do that
207423 what is up with you why are you so weird

207429 moving to the southwest out of the northwest is a big step
207430 it will definitely be a challenge moving out of our comfort area
207431 our goal has always been to provide resources and networking opportunities with tribes
207432 you need constant training to make sure youre taking advantage of what is available
207433 every conference that i go to i take what i learn back and present it to my co workers
207434 i hope to be a part of the group that makes it successful
207435 the character johnny is a shambolic musician who hides out in a london crack den at the time i was writing it pete doherty was everywhere
207436 i think what we all like is someone who fell and then stood up again and thats probably the story with pete doherty
207437 its very unusual for an environmental impact statement to do something of this magnitude to begin with
207438 but based on all of the public concern about previous sampling the department of energy decided it was a very important first step to truly take an independent view at the data to look at it with a fresh pair of eyes so to speak
207439 over the years theres been extensive sampling and analysis done at santa susana but many of the sampling events occurred a really long time ago and consequently were not up to the technical standards of today
207440 most of the samples in the past were taken in areas where we suspected there was contamination or where we knew contamination existed like around certain facilities
207441 the gap analysis scientists suggested we go into those other areas of the site where we didnt have any samples or where we didnt believe there was any contamination
207442 this action resulted from several months of negotiations between the agencies and represents a significant step forward with regard to characterizing the site for radiological contaminants
207443 its a great start but we need to know a lot more
207444 the analysis still doesnt call for enough areas to be tested we need even more sampling because we just dont know how far the contamination goes
207445 you have to understand its been 30 years of really reluctant action
207446 we have to stay on them let them know that the public demands a complete cleanup of the site in accordance with the guidelines set forth in senate bill 990
207447 i think the department of energy is doing good things now but remember theyre doing it because they were forced to by a judge
207448 even though the meetings are over the public can still use their voice for a lot of good

207452 the corporation was created outside the auspices of the municipality to keep it free of government interference
207453 falls cable access is a private not for profit corporation completely independent of the municipality
207454 i have had no dealings with them since becoming village attorney in 1999
207455 all of a sudden the money is pouring in and we cant spend it fast enough
207456 based on the facts presently available to me and the applicable law my conclusion is that the fcac is not a legal arm or sub unit of the the village and therefore not an
207457 i have and continue to hold the belief that the fcac is a corporate entity separate and apart from the village the village cannot legally control the corporation
207458 do you turn all of your neighbors who try to do nice things in to the irs
207459 this is why people are after you as i struggle with 2 kids in college overcome health problems and continue to slide into debt it makes me sick that i have contributed more than 500 000 in services and 3 000 hours of services to this community
207460 if the village board attempts to take any of these funds and put them in the village general fund i will immediately begin charging for my services at the standard going rate for television program production
207461 falls cable access is a private not for profit corporation not subject to the open records request submitted by newspapers any request for information must come from the village of menomonee falls
207462 we will not be conducting an audit or review of the financial statements of menomonee falls cable access corporation and therefore we will not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on them
207463 it would appear that the corporation should have filed form 990 for each year of operation
207464 these congressional approval ratings are worse than we had on the eve of losing the majority

207480 disturbed skeptical and saddened after viewing a new ad by john mccain which likens barack obama to britney spears and paris hilton
207481 we are not sure whether the negative emotions expressed by viewers were related to their feelings about either candidate or about the way in which the message was delivered
207482 however we do know that the ad did not move voters and they expressed negative emotions after viewing the ad
207483 like so many other promises cast aside in his pursuit of the white house john mccains promise to run a respectful campaign didnt even make it to his convention
207484 we all respect john mccains service to our country but he has clearly become an honorable man running a deeply dishonorable campaign the american people deserve better and john mccain knows it
207485 while there are particularly challenging economic conditions affecting some of our largest overseas markets this year these figures from the cso show that the number of overseas visitors to ireland increased by over 4 in the first five months of 2008 it is particularly encouraging to note that the great britain and us markets have held up
207486 while a lot of attention rightly focuses on the contribution of overseas visitors coming to ireland we must not forget the importance of domestic tourism
207487 f orced cohabitation in military conditions which offer little or no privacy would force persons to live with persons who might be sexually attracted to them
207488 the allegedly assaulted woman predicted that if professed homosexuals serve in the military an assault like the one i endured would be de criminalized on the grounds that the victim is a homophobe if they wont just relax and enjoy being sexually assaulted

207494 aku melihat nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam berwudhu maka beliau shallallahu alaihi wa sallam mencuci dua telapak tangannya sebanyak tiga kali
207495 artinya sempurnakan wudhumu dan sela selalah antara jari jemarimu dan bersungguh sungguhlah dalam memasukkan air ke dalam hidung kecuali jika kamu dalam keadaan berpuasa
207496 nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam suka mengawali sesuatu dengan yang kanan dalam memakai terompah bersisir bersuci dan dalam segala sesuatu
207497 bahwa nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam ada menyela nyela jenggotnya
207498 bahwa nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam jika berwudhu mengambil seraup air kemudian meletakkannya dibawah dagunya dan berkata
207499 artinya adalah rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam ketika berwudhu dengan takaran air sebanyak satu mud dan mandi dengan takaran sebanyak satu sha sampai lima muda
207500 berkata rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam tidaklah salah seorang diantara kalian berwudhu dan menyempurnakan wudhunya kemudian mengucapkan

207502 artinya aku bersaksi bahw tidak ada illah sesembahan yang berhak disembah selain allah semata yang tidak ada sekutu baginya dan aku bersaksi bahwa muhammad adalah hambanya dan utusannya melainkan dibukakan untuknya delapan pintu syurga ia dapat masuk dari mana saja yang ia kehendaki
207503 artinya ya allah jadikan aku termasuk orang orang yang bertaubat dan jadikan aku termasuk orang orang yang suka mensucikan diri
207504 hopefully hes not fighting anymore and going after a guy in the stands
207505 i understand what yao said but im still ghetto thats not going to change im never going to change my culture yao has played with a lot of black players but i dont think hes ever played with a black player that really represents his culture as much as i represent my culture

207508 artinya kunci shalat adalah bersuci shalat diawali dengan membaca takbir dan diakhiri dengan membaca salam
207509 artinya dan allah menurunkan kepadamu hujan dari langit untuk menyucikan kamu
207510 artinya dan kami turunkan dari langit air yang amat bersih suci
207511 artinya sesungguhnya air itu tidak bisa dinajiskan oleh apapun kecuali oleh benda yang mengubah bau rasa dan warnanya
207512 artinya semua air itu suci kecuali apabila telah berubah bau rasa dan warnanya dengan sebab kemasukan benda bernajis
207513 this is a great opportunity for us to show chinese readers what first class journalism we can deliver

207515 this is a good sign its a work in progress these are initial encouraging signs
207516 vmware esxi delivers dramatically quicker and easier installation of virtual appliances this enables our customers to deploy altor s virtual network analysis and security solutions even faster giving them instant visibility into their virtual network activity said amir ben efraim chief executive officer of altor networks with vmware esxi accelerating the pace of virtual appliance deployments in the datacenter the demand for virtual network firewalls also accelerates we are excited to be a vmware partner and support vmware esxi across our products simplifying the delivery and deployment of catbird s v agent virtual appliance via the open virtualization format ovf and vmware esxi is a terrific component of our goal of ensuring catbird customers have instant easy to use protection and compliance for their virtual environments
207517 the vmware virtual appliance marketplace is a great vehicle for our appliance and is a user friendly high value place to shop companies are rapidly deploying virtualization technology because of its clear financial benefits however the potential security threats are often overlooked said juliette sultan head of global marketing at check point software technologies our vpn 1 security solution fully supports vmware esxi implementations so customers can protect the data communication on their virtual networks with the same proven security used to protect their physical networks by utilizing the open virtualization format ovf for our virtual appliance mindtouch deki becomes even easier for customers to test drive and use
207518 the ability to easily import and deploy our virtual appliance with vmware esxi means fewer troubleshooting issues and a higher adoption rate two keys to advancing deki in the marketplace the spread of vmware esxi will no doubt contribute to the ongoing success of mindtouch deki
207519 vmware esxi represents an opportunity to vastly expand the overall virtualization ecosystem said punit minocha vice president of business development at trend micro business development
207520 vmware esxi confirms vmware s trajectory to keep layering on the breakthroughs said stephen dennis president of virtualappliances
207521 we interviewed the people who have inspired us with the hope that they will inspire and teach others we want to explain culturally how ideas evolve
207522 you should not be jumping to conclusions about this case
207523 i guarantee this case is nothing like what has been reported so far
207524 she wants to resolve the charges that were brought against her as quickly as possible because she is innocent
207525 in 1997 in eastern parts of nepal there were about 67 nests
207526 and in four or five years in 2001 there was zero
207527 so that rapidly they declined from india nepal and pakistan and over 12 years they started declining now more than 95 of the vultures number has gone down
207528 it is also anti inflammatory but has been tested against vultures and other birds of prey and general birds and does not cause damage to these birds
207529 yes they are ugly looking but they are really helpful for us
207530 see within half an hour they finished eating all that dead animal only the skeleton is left it is really helpful to clean the nature
207531 traditionally we see the vulture as a very bad bird
207532 if it passes your house then the house has to be purified they can bring danger
207533 but that belief is disappearing people realise that vultures eat rotten things and we must preserve them
207534 we tell them about the new medicine meloxicam and how we can save the birds by using it
207535 once we established the vulture restaurant in five or six months we found double that number the maximum number i have recorded is about 156 all at the same time on the same carcass
207536 in a short time we caught hundreds of species 10 of which may be new to science it was unreal unbelievable
207537 catching is the easy bit the hard bit is going back to the lab and examining the species comparing them to collections and books seeing if they are new to science one hour in the field can equal hundreds of hours in the lab
207538 the expedition captured on film the discovery of the strongest candidates for new species two fishes
207539 it was quite a thrill luring this spider the size of a soup plate out of its hole and holding it although i can see that this wouldnt be everyones idea of fun
207540 we have a choice we really are at the cross roads now we can decide to keep these rich hotspots of nature or see them razed to the ground
207541 the arrest of karadzic has put him back on the political stage
207542 he has re emerged from the shadows and no one can be quite sure what effect that will have
207543 my arrest will mean the end of the bosnian serb republic republika srpska
207544 the division of bosnia that was mr karadzics dream is now more likely than at any time since he became a fugitive
207545 if it couldnt be destroyed in 1992 when the serbs attacked or in 1993 when the croats joined with the serbs to attack it it wont collapse now
207546 bosnia today is in its worst situation since the war because of the strength of nationalist rhetoric at every level of life
207547 the arrest of karadzic is a good sign that bosnia and the whole region is strong enough to continue political and economic reforms that will finally lead to reconciliation
207548 if iran continues its nuclear weapons programme we will attack it
207549 homosexuality does exist in africa its not a western thing as our african bishops would want people to believe
207550 people began to send me death threats by e mail by text messages and it got so serious i had to flee nigeria to togo
207551 i am so grateful to the government of the uk for granting me asylum for giving me safety and for allowing me to be alive to continue my work
207552 i think they should open their ears to listen rather than doing the talking
207553 for people like me and my members to begin to come out to have pride in who we are i think change is coming
207554 the bishops need to know that what comes out of their mouths is affecting us and putting us in a very difficult situation
207555 in the past certain irresponsible politicians in the north have accused southern serbs of collaborating with the authorities in pristina
207556 they do not or refuse to understand that the situation south of the ibar river is different
207557 i like to compare kosovos status to the weather you cannot support the weather
207558 i could be one of those people who adores the winter and goes out in a heavy overcoat on a day like this baking heat on the other hand i could adjust to the situation i am in
207559 since the unilateral declaration of independence many people here have been saving money to buy property in central serbia as a fallback option
207560 if the so called kosovan republic starts to impose its laws its language its teachers and its doctors on serb areas that will be the end of the serbian community in kosovo
207561 the government is supposed to give us 95 861 they have only given us 19 354
207562 the free secondary education is really a challenge we have creditors we cannot pay them
207563 there has been an increase in the student population which means increasing the infrastructure so where do you get the beds the books with the peanuts that the government sends
207564 it should be understood that our system is a transformation it has its own challenges
207565 one will an older candidate or older president have the energy and sharpness to do the job well and secondly theres a concern about whether an older president will have old ideas
207566 im older than dirt and ive got more scars than frankenstein
207567 i will not make age an issue in this campaign
207568 im not going to exploit for political purposes my opponents youth and inexperience
207569 because i get mixed feelings from people i have always had to defend him but its probably five
207570 i think that his message is a little bit more traditional and more pragmatic which makes it harder to appeal to voters on an emotional level
207571 and i think that you have to have that if you want to inspire people and get them motivated making sure barack obama doesnt get the nomination motivates us more than john mccains message which is a problem in and of itself
207572 one of the most common prejudices we have in american society is a prejudice against age
207573 young is always better old age is bad thats the prejudiced attitude and to paint mccain with a brush that says i can look at his age and know everything i need to know about him is just as wrong as looking at obama and saying i can look at his skin colour and know everything i need to know about him its not fair
207574 it depends who he picks for vice president i dont think his age makes any difference
207575 if he has to pick a special vice president then youre worried about his age sure you are
207576 i was a young boy then we fled and lived in a refugee camp i started as an assistant truck driver and after 16 years i learned how to drive for all these years i have been driving mostly between pakistan and afghanistan
207577 nothing gets done without money these days during the taleban days we didnt have to pay bribes
207578 i leave peshawar and we start paying bribes once we cross into our country we start paying bribes we have got used to it by now
207579 we have in the past sacked corrupt traffic policemen and other police officials we have also prosecuted them if these drivers help us with some evidence we will sack the corrupt officials we are very serious about this
207580 i hope this ruling will be studied very well and the related party will get the message intended
207581 today the court did not reach the required number of votes for a party closure but this decision is a warning to the party a serious warning
207582 such a decision is as bad as banning a party
207583 the sanctions say the party is guilty so its opponents will always label it as fundamentalist
207584 this result actually says the akp is not a secular party the judges have shaken the party and told it you have to work within our borders their hands have been tied
207585 this road will carry us to full membership of the eu
207586 there is no doubt that this process has given lessons to everyone and its no secret that the case has caused intense but constructive debate within the ak party
207587 that debate will inform how we go about our business in the coming months the new challenge for us and others including the opposition is to steer the country to compromise
207588 now for the next few months the akp will look very democratic and pro eu
207589 then they will sit down and say right to avoid another accident we need to change the make up of the constitutional court and put our own men everywhere in the bureaucracy then they will run the country in their own way
207590 i didnt vote for the akp but im glad it wasnt closed down that would have flung our country back 10 years
207591 my son satyendra went missing seven years ago he was 10 then it was 6am he was playing outside and then he disappeared i have no idea who could have taken him i have no enemies
207592 i lodged a complaint with the police they asked me to have 300 posters made with his photo they said they will put them up at all police stations in the city i did but the posters never went up i have no idea where my son is
207593 if police wanted they could have found him but theyve not helped me for seven years why would they bother now
207594 i dont think anyone can imagine 1 000 children going missing in london but it happens in delhi and the administration doesnt even take notice thats a very sad state of affairs
207595 there are two possibilities why children missing for even five or seven years are not found one the police are unable to find them two theyre not interested in finding them and i believe its the second reason
207596 the administration and police have class biases the poor dont have a voice so police dont register their cases they are very selective in registering cases and when they do register a case there is no proper investigation
207597 the police and administration react fast when a child from an affluent family goes missing we want the poor to get the same treatment they have the same rights we want all the missing children found we want the police to be more receptive to the poor
207598 we are demanding immediate registration of cases there should be a proper investigation and follow up in each case and we need to revamp the police administration
207599 children are our future if our future is lost what is left
207600 its a very serious issue the police have to create conditions that no child is lost and those who do go missing should be found immediately
207601 what were seeing is re recruiting and ongoing attempts by different armed groups to continue with the military option
207602 were very concerned about what appears to be preparations for renewed conflict
207603 i think that they are ultimately afraid to disarm and to demobilise and they want to hold on to the land that they have through military means
207604 this of course raises serious questions about the governments commitment to the peace process in eastern congo
207605 i have underlined as i did a few days before in kinshasa that in the view of the international community an armed offensive against the arms group would be disastrous
207606 those responsible for the army in the east have underlined that there are no plans for a military offensive
207607 village president not a bad gig if you can get it
207608 i believe it has been over 8 years since i last attended a meeting or have been notified of a meeting
207609 the corporation was created outside the auspices of the municipality to keep it free of government interference
207610 falls cable access is a private not for profit corporation completely independent of the municipality
207611 i have had no dealings with them since becoming village attorney in 1999
207612 all of a sudden the money is pouring in and we cant spend it fast enough

207614 i have and continue to hold the belief that the fcac is a corporate entity separate and apart from the village the village cannot legally control the corporation
207615 do you turn all of your neighbors who try to do nice things in to the irs
207616 this is why people are after you as i struggle with 2 kids in college overcome health problems and continue to slide into debt it makes me sick that i have contributed more than 500 000 in services and 3 000 hours of services to this community
207617 if the village board attempts to take any of these funds and put them in the village general fund i will immediately begin charging for my services at the standard going rate for television program production
207618 falls cable access is a private not for profit corporation not subject to the open records request submitted by newspapers any request for information must come from the village of menomonee falls
207619 we will not be conducting an audit or review of the financial statements of menomonee falls cable access corporation and therefore we will not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on them

207621 this is something that needs a lot of time to heal it really hurts me to say i have to miss the olympics
207622 after wednesdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
207623 there are so many mixed feelings because on wednesday night they were almost positive there was something wrong with my nerve which could have ultimately been much more serious
207624 but after thursday mornings tests for the first time in a while they were able to give me a different answer and a different problem this is something that needs a lot of time to heal it really hurts me to say i have to miss the olympics
207625 you want to help people and do well for society then make something of yourself be successful and then you will be able to help until then you are just wasting your time and not being of service
207626 if i am not for myself who will be for me but if i am only for myself who am i if not now when
207627 in american you can become anything you want to be
207628 we think that the timing of a new product introduction will depend upon the sales profile for the ds and believe that lower than expected ds hardware sales could trigger an earlier launch for the new device
207629 ds sales are solid worldwide but are weak in japan leading us to expect an introduction of a new device in japan before the end of the calendar year
207630 we think that the lions share of the expected 28 million ds hardware units shipped during the fiscal year will land in the us and europe and we expect to see strong software sales in those territories
207631 the constant put downs chipping away at me i think people are frightened of saying anything to him
207632 you stood your ground and told him what you thought
207633 hes only nice to kat because everyone thinks shes going to win thats the only reason hes nice to her
207634 he dominates its all about him his restaurants his control his hate towards women but you cross him and he doesnt like it
207635 i thought she would be one of those people that only talks about bands that you havent even heard about
207636 but she couldnt be further away from the stories you read shes very self effacing and laughs when i take the p out of her which is important
207637 shes an absolute dream i say that with complete surprise in my voice because i was absolutely dreading it
207638 i texted her when i was told about the incident she replied im fine its been completely blown out of proportion are you going to the
207639 i presume whatever happened wasnt quite what was it was made out to be in the papers
207640 the first is the media witch hunt which began in the muslim media even before the beginning of the armed conflict and which proclaimed me a war criminal at a time when the only victims were serbs
207641 it is now unimaginable to many people that this court could acquit me i believe that this fact seriously jeopardizes the trial itself
207642 it then became clear to me that i could not come before the tribunal

207657 last night i was a trillionaire today ill be using coins
207658 what were seeing is re recruiting and ongoing attempts by different armed groups to continue with the military option
207659 were very concerned about what appears to be preparations for renewed conflict
207660 i think that they are ultimately afraid to disarm and to demobilise and they want to hold on to the land that they have through military means
207661 this of course raises serious questions about the governments commitment to the peace process in eastern congo
207662 i have underlined as i did a few days before in kinshasa that in the view of the international community an armed offensive against the arms group would be disastrous
207663 those responsible for the army in the east have underlined that there are no plans for a military offensive

207672 she may not be ready for change this is her state of mind it has nothing to do with me
207673 she has other priorities shes already developed a relationship with someone else so what people have multiple relationships

207675 the court has established that the accused nevzlin organized the execution a number of extremely serious crimes
207676 the defence views this process as unjust from its very beginning the verdict is illegal and unreasonable
207677 mr holbrooke obligated himself on behalf of the us that i would not be tried before this tribunal
207678 it is clear that due the fact that the agreements he holbrooke made on behalf of the us were not implemented he has moved on to plan b the liquidation of radovan karadzic
207679 this agreement was signed on july 18 1996 but i did not give karadzic anything in exchange
207680 and it would have been a lot better had someone ordered nato to arrest him when it was still possible
207681 in a way it is flattering that he thinks my arm reaches to the hague
207682 but the truth is i am just an ordinary citizen and karadzic is where he should have been a long time ago at the icty
207683 there were no efforts to drop the charges against karadzic
207684 about five minutes after i had gone upstairs we began to smell gas in our dorm and almost immediately after that there was an enormous explosion
207685 i tend to always admire nehru in particular he is a real hero of mine the stories around partition really moved me it was a terrible event the things that i found most moving were people that had really risen above that and helped their neighbors
207686 the gandhi family has not been in touch so i dont know how they feel i know that the mountbatten family in the end were quite pleased with it although initially they were quite worried that i was writing about this story again the indian political community has generally been quite positive i got some lovely reviews in india and internationally as well i have got a few reviews in the us

207704 i have had no dealings with them since becoming village attorney in 1999
207705 all of a sudden the money is pouring in and we cant spend it fast enough

207707 i have and continue to hold the belief that the fcac is a corporate entity separate and apart from the village the village cannot legally control the corporation

207712 we will not be conducting an audit or review of the financial statements of menomonee falls cable access corporation and therefore we will not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on them
207713 it would appear that the corporation should have filed form 990 for each year of operation
207714 councilwoman jan perry who has pushed for a moratorium for six years said the initiative would give the city time to craft measures to lure sit down restaurants serving healthier food to a part of the city that desperately wants more of them

207716 the majority are being caught in the shrimp trawls particularly in the gulf of mexico

207730 what we teach them here is not just for them its also for them to take back to their units and be able to take what theyve learned here and help others in their services to be as proficient as they are
207731 it shows them the differences between what they do and what we do we try to incorporate what we learn here so that when the next classes come we can show them a better way to do it
207732 the most important thing theyll have is the knowledge we want to try to show them that in order to make your organization better you have to share that knowledge
207733 i dont think anybody really looked at the logistics side
207734 they figured while the enemy was still very strong before the surge we had to make sure security came first now that things have calmed down we can start focusing on the logistics capabilities for the iraqi army and iraqi police thats the next stage were looking at
207735 adaptability is really critical for them they make things happen based on what they have and they are doing phenomenal things
207736 its the ability to talk to higher command and know that whats being said is going to happen if somehow theyre seeing positive reinforcement on their logistics systems thats what i want to see change i want to see the small steps toward that vision that all these individuals have

207758 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers

207782 with the exception of the united kingdom all geographic regions produced robust organic revenue growth over the first half
207783 market conditions improved slightly from the first quarter of 2008 but not sufficiently to recover positive organic revenue growth given the high comparables in 2007
207784 the ongoing deterioration of macro economic conditions is likely to impact our growth rate in the second half but we still expect to be within our previously forecast range of organic revenue growth of 6 to 7 in 2008 leading to an increased operating margin for the year
207785 the commissions view is that it would not be able to issue finalised guidance in this area until the relevant primary legislation had received royal assent and the commission had carefully considered the wider context in which guidance would operate and consulted widely on the content of the guidance
207786 come into effect when the bill receives royal assent candidate spending infringements are regulated by the police and the courts
207787 the electoral commission acknowledges current rules on campaign funding are ineffective
207788 we have said for some time that we think the current regulated period for candidate spending is too short but that any change in the rules would need to address the scope for uncertainty and avoidance
207789 it may be possible to achieve this with the right combination of statutory rules and commission guidance
207790 however we would want to consider any changes carefully to ensure our guidance works with any changes to the law to achieve a fair framework for all candidates
207791 for a governing party to rig election rules just months before an election in order to cling on to power has all the hallmarks of a banana republic

207799 realising i could not gain control i saw no point in spending the final two weeks in a debilitating fight where little would be accomplished except to build animosity between both camps and the end result would be no better than the compromise that was reached

207839 exxons profits are exploding the company earned nearly 12 billion in the last three months exxon earns nearly 90 000 a minute thats almost 1 500 every second the reason profits have gone up so much the price of oil has exploded on the world market up 61 percent in the last year
207840 drowning in debt so many people while the oil companies seem to be rolling dough
207841 it may seem surprising that oil and natural gas earnings are typically in line with the average of other major manufacturing industries
207842 this fact is not well understood however in part because reports usually focus on only half the story the profits earned
207843 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
207844 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
207845 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
207846 young man this is going to be a question and answer session you can ask your questions after sit down

207851 doesnt look like all the other presidents on the dollar bills
207852 are you going to believe me or your lying eyes
207853 it doesnt matter what i think im not interested in politics see this taxi brother its my bread my taxis will be at home
207854 in this business you cannot have a stiff neck otherwise youll be lying there in the cemetery
207855 some staff will be afraid to come in like most businesses around here there is a policy of no work no pay so the staff lose we will try to accommodate them but what can we do
207856 it depends on the day if it looks dangerous well close
207857 we stand to lose lots of money i dont know if my staff will be able to come to work
207858 they have told us nothing if he goes to criminal trial for two three months whats going to happen to us i built this business up from scratch over the last 10 years they can close us in a month
207859 we dont predict any problems if theres trouble well just close the door people must eat and thats good for us
207860 these people zuma supporters dont buy a lot and with so many people how can i put up my stand
207861 when he was spending the money he was spending it alone he should go and stand trial alone so we can carry on with our business if he wins its only those people who are his supporters that will get something
207862 they dont buy anything and the usual customers dont come when they are here
207863 we are not expecting people to stay away from work on these two days because we have been told that taxis would be operating the expected stayaway that many people have spoken about is not likely to occur
207864 a life sentence would be both a just sentence and an appropriate one in this matter
207865 was overcome by his sexual urges grabbed the girl threw her onto the ground next to a fowl run and raped her
207866 i am extremely remorseful for my actions and i dont know what came over me i have never before transgressed the law
207867 she was only seven years old and the accused was known to her as oupa and she trusted him her injuries were serious and the evidence of the clinical psychologist is the girl has been severely damaged by the rape incident
207868 state advocate thembela jikela has said he the accused had no option but to plead guilty because members of the community saw him on top of the girl and pulled him off her
207869 had developed an overwhelming fear of all men and ran away in terror whenever one approached her
207870 the girl now suffers from enuresis bedwetting and has been further confused by the beating she was given by a woman after she had been raped
207871 she displays symptoms of hyperarousal intrusion and constriction powerlessness as a result of the psychological and emotional trauma of being raped
207872 these are highly consistent with symptoms typically found in children who are traumatised as a consequence of sexual assault s he is likely to experience the long term symptoms of constriction which will have a pervasive and negative life changing impact on her
207873 they all took to her like a daughter and so she was in a situation where for the time being she could settle down
207874 if youve got a slowing economy then the flow through to growth in the economy and the flow through to employment one just follows from the other
207875 im not in the business of making wild promises for the future
207876 we are in the best position in a better position than most other economies in the western world given our strong budgetary position
207877 the momentum of all these negative factors has brought the economy to a virtual standstill
207878 mr rudd needs to stop blaming everyone else for his problems stop talking ruddish and start managing the economy for the benefit of all australians
207879 all year kevin rudd and wayne swan have been doing everything they can to talk down our economy talk up inflation
207880 vermutlich haben viele fahrer anfangs probleme mit k rnenden reifen gehabt da war ich wohl nicht der einzige aber ich fand die balance meines autos ausgesprochen bescheiden
207881 wir haben in beiden trainings diverse nderungen gemacht die aber nicht viel gebracht haben zum letzten outing haben wir dann gr ere ver nderungen vorgenommen und zum gl ck hat sich gezeigt dass das ein schritt in die richtige richtung war ich bin froh dass wir das noch ausprobiert haben denn jetzt wissen wir viel mehr
207882 wir haben die reifenmischungen getestet und am setup gearbeitet um herauszufinden wie sich das auto und die reifen auf dieser strecke verhalten wir werden nun die daten analysieren und uns auf samstag vorbereiten
207883 red bull toyota und renault mit denen wir uns vergleichen k nnen sind jetzt einfach schneller es ist fraglich ob wir den r ckstand schon in ungarn aufholen k nnen
207884 zudem kommen jetzt kurse die uns liegen sollten budapest wie gesagt valencia und vielleicht auch singapur ich denke wir werden in der restlichen saison einige gute rennen haben
207885 das w rde mir nicht weiterhelfen ich schaue immer nach vorne und versuche die entscheidungen zu treffen die f r mich in dem moment die richtigen sind
207886 ich bin sicher meine zeit wird kommen und ich werde mir rad an rad duelle mit lewis liefern k nnen
207887 zudem gibt es n chstes jahr ein v llig neues reglement und wir sind dann vielleicht wieder ganz vorne dabei
207888 victoria police is constantly considering options to combat public drunkenness and disorderly behaviour
207889 weve had some preliminary discussions with police about the concept
207890 it drunk tanks scheme may well be of assistance particularly to young women who get into difficulty
207891 i think anything to assist with the problem of drunkenness on the streets is a good idea but its only one small part of the problem
207892 the issues really surround having sufficient transport options to get home
207893 id like to know what these things look like and where they are going to locate them
207894 we were having a conversation and myles was somewhere i knew he was safe so i relaxed for a second
207895 we ripped off myles clothes and called emergency and they said to put him under the shower but it seemed like forever until the ambulance arrived
207896 his eyes rolled into the back of his head because the pain was too much for him
207897 if parents take their eye off the ball even for a few seconds particularly with toddlers just learning to walk it can be a life changing event
207898 there will be 1200 horses in various competitions including the garryowen and a world cup showjumping qualifier to be held under lights at night
207899 in this case we thought that his looks might have been a contributing factor in him not finding a home
207900 we thought it might improve his luck and boost his self confidence
207901 he didnt mind being clipped at all and hes very happy to be handled by everyone
207902 there was a bath then a clip all over and a blow dry
207903 the first thing you see is the neglect in their coats
207904 sometimes you have to put them under anaesthetic to clip out tangles
207905 i think were starting to see the effects of the economic downturn
207906 it is possible the driver was not aware they had hit somebody and we would like them to come forward so we can better piece together the tragic circumstances
207907 but as far as accidents like this go theyre extremely rare
207908 theyd be very unlucky train control is set up in such a way that if theres a reported incident they stop all the trains
207909 we hope to get back on track past benalla on sunday but its likely to be monday
207910 warn that if democrats win power in november theyll likely change federal law to make it easier for workers to unionize companies including wal mart
207911 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
207912 the national labor relations board ruled that wal mart illegally fired an employee in kingman ariz who supported the ufcw and illegally threatened to freeze merit pay increases if employees voted for union representation the decision came eight years after the organizing campaign failed and four years after the case was originally heard
207913 the united food and commercial workers was successful in organizing only one group of wal mart workers a small number of butchers in east texas in early 2000 several weeks later the company phased out butchers in all of its stores and began stocking prepackaged meat when a store in canada voted to unionize several years ago the company closed the store saying it had been unprofitable for years
207914 good parenting and were encouraged to use at home the skills they had been taught they also attended discussion groups with between 10 and 15 other parents
207915 this study provides substantial evidence that these programmes can be rolled out effectively across a large number of local authorities there is now considerable evidence to suggest that such programmes do have benefits in improving antisocial behaviour in children and the psychological and social functioning of parents
207916 all local authorities were aware of this as a problem and related it to the timing of the courses parent being seen to mean mother and a lack of men running the classes
207917 fathers perhaps feel a bit inhibited by parenting courses particular efforts need to be made to address this
207918 really useful but particularly when the course is finished so that if i feel myself slipping or old behaviours are coming back i can look to it
207919 det er desv rre en misforst else at det ikke er farligt n r der ikke er nogen der er i gang med vejarbejdet det er selvf lgelig helt afg rende at man viser hensyn til de der arbejder der men det er ogs et v sentligt budskab at vejarbejde i sig selv udg r en v sentlig risiko for de bilister der k rer der is r n r de k rer for st rkt
207920 s n r det g r galt g r det virkelig alvorligt galt
207921 the primary benefit of this agreement is that it eliminates uncertainty with respect to future losses related to this transaction
207922 we view the final outcome as favorable in light of the numerous widely circulated models that assumed a 100 write off for this transaction this settlement also confirms our view that transaction mark to market adjustments are not indicative of ultimate credit impairment
207923 were thrilled to be able to feature these pictures in people
207924 they will delight our readers who have followed the growth of the jolie pitt family

207944 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain had a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
207945 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
207946 i think they is everyone out there who wants to make sure barack obama doesnt become president
207947 i think when barack was using that phraseology he was talking about the larger issue of the challenges he has in this election
207948 you know it is harder to get elected president of the united states if you are black
207949 i dont think he was suggesting that john mccain was racist
207950 he was talking about a campaign that thinks they can win the presidency by putting down barack obama the bottom line is the only person that is obsessed with barack obama appears to be john mccain
207951 karl rove has put his people in there and for the last two weeks they have an incessant drumbeat of nasty nasty stuff
207952 i think when barack was using that phraseology he was talking about the larger issue of the challenges he has in this election
207953 you know it is harder to get elected president of the united states if you are black

207961 thats not going to change im never going to change my culture
207962 yao has played with a lot of black players but i dont think hes ever played with a black player that really represents his culture as much as i represent my culture once yao ming gets to know me hell understand what im about
207963 if you go back to the brawl thats a culture issue right there somebody was disrespecting me so hes got to understand where im coming from people that know me know that ron artest never changed
207964 but while i can stick a pirated clip from youtube on my web site with two clicks theres usually no simple straightforward way to do the same thing from a legitimate site
207965 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
207966 i had the courage and the judgment to say that i would rather lose a political campaign than lose a war it seems to me that senator obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
207967 what shall it profit it man if he gain the republican nomination and lose his own soul
207968 what is a man a miserable little pile of secrets
207969 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down their spine
207970 obama spokesman robert gibbs said thursday that the senator was not referring to race
207971 courage is grace under pressure mccain showed it when he was a prisoner of war
207972 he must really share my values maybe we disagree and maybe he sometimes does things that look like hes wrong but deep down hes just like me hes moderate like me hes humble like me
207973 joes middle east reporting has been pretty consistent and his campaign reporting is better than about 95 of those out there meaning he always says something that drives me nuts but he also says some stuff i think is not only an important point but ignored by everyone else
207974 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because janet reno is her father
207975 we are leasing you the rights for a reason for the benefit of the people and upon which you will make a profit get the resource or let us find someone who will

207978 im really good at writing i excel at that but when i wasnt doing well in math that pushed everything else down too because i got so discouraged
207979 there are lots of kids who are going to drop out not graduate
207980 the first tee was frankly more difficult than i thought it would be
207981 but i made a good swing and the nerves went away absolutely five feet off the tee box and i didnt have them all day again
207982 i was just happy to get it in the air
207983 someone drops the puck someone hits you in the face there are not any more nerves thats the game
207984 theres no place out here to just kind of shake them
207985 after i hit balls on the practice range i went for a jog i ran over to the clubhouse just to breathe a little harder and try to calm down a bit so i dont think theres a whole lot you can do on the golf course other than have the experience of going through it
207986 the difference with hockey is youre nervous youve got all that anxiety and youre ready to go but the first shift you get out there and you pop somebody or somebody pops you and then the games on the nerves are gone
207987 yeah i got the benefit of herbie and none of the pleasure wish i could have played for herbie longer
207988 my dreams were pretty big for hockey and i have to tell you most of them were fulfilled i didnt think that i would see and do the things i did by the time i was 25 or 26 years old
207989 i would guess its kind of your curtis cup walker cup ryder cup kind of environment golf is an individual game and occasionally you get to represent your country there is nothing more special that you will ever do in sport
207990 the millions i guess are nice and people like that but you want nerves and apprehension put that jersey on one time
207991 i watched just like everybody else and was thoroughly excited
207992 i never felt one ounce of regret or should have been there im just thankful that they had the right guys there at that time to win
207993 it was a long winter it was a measurable winter herbie was a very very very demanding and difficult coach to play for
207994 you dont know if you played harder to prove him wrong about something or if you just were mad at him all the time that was part of his philosophy he didnt want friends he wanted everybody ticked off all the time and fighting each other for jobs and fighting him and fighting everything else
207995 we have to go through this exercise but it is important to recognise that we are proposing this in order to encourage debate if we refuse to consider option 3 then option 3 will be imposed by the government the only way to protect our green belt is to consider option 3 say no and then move forward it could not be simpler than that
207996 it is important to stress that the city council is not making any specific proposals here we know this is controversial and is likely to generate opposition but we must point out that as part of the new development planning system option 3 enables such propositions to be properly tested
207997 a far more robust solution will be to proceed with the consultation and then to base any decision on the level and locations of growth in the context of all representations received
207998 its a policy of this council to protect the green belt its a government requirement for us to go ahead with this consultation
207999 if we didnt put it forward they would try and remove our rights to make decisions on some of these issues we had no choice
208000 nelson is deserving of an opportunity if we have an opening hell get that opportunity but there is nobody here who deserves to lose their spot

208002 personally satisfying its not like i have any vendetta against the rangers for not keeping me around i had a good experience here it was the experience that started on my embarkation of what i am doing now throwing a knuckleball there are some guys in that front office and on that team i am real thankful for but it is satisfying for me because the last time i was on this field it didnt go so well
208003 im the type of player who feels that if i go out and do my job on the field then contracts will take care of themselves thats my plan i have never forced for a contract or an extension anywhere im not going to start now

208014 municipalities large and small need to think differently in the face of challenges such as global warming shrinking supplies of natural resources rapidly accelerating demand for infrastructure in developing nations and growing shortages of new talent entering the engineering professions
208015 in establishing the genoa urban lab we have gathered some of the top design and urban planning minds from around the world their keen insight and vision coupled with the advanced capabilities of bentleys solutions for the lifecycle of infrastructure will enable us to create an innovative and effective plan that respects the citys different environments by establishing firm boundaries between built areas green areas and blue or seaside areas quality growth will replace quantity growth and our design philosophy will be to build on built rather than to encroach further on our precious natural environments
208016 the mission of the urban lab is very much in alignment with our own mission at bentley to provide solutions to design build and operate the worlds infrastructure with the goals of sustaining our society sustaining our environment and sustaining the infrastructure professions the architects and engineers the surveyors and planners and the contractors and operators who play a key role in sustaining infrastructure
208017 almost 516 years ago christopher columbus genoas most famous son set forth on a voyage of discovery that changed the way we view the world so it is fitting that the urban lab is on a ship in genoa ready for its own voyage of discovery but unlike columbus and his small crew the project team setting the stage for genoas future will not be sailing alone it will share this journey with the many architects and engineers around the globe who are working to find more sustainable solutions for infrastructure

208058 sound strange while the scenario above is obviously a pretty simplified take on the budget impasse it does point to one of the paradoxes of modern california politics democrats often represent many of the wealthy citizens who would pay the higher taxes on the well off that theyre pushing while many republicans represent poorer districts that receive more state funds than they pay out
208059 v oters have passed laws that virtually guarantee annual spending increases for education severely restrict what can be cut from transportation and local governments and make it virtually impossible to raise taxes
208060 when voters are polled huge majorities oppose cuts to schools health care law enforcement road building parks the environment just about everything the state does but they also oppose higher taxes on sales property and income except for the highest earners
208061 they want to spend without being taxed enough to support all the spending theyve mandated over the years said republican political consultant
208062 schwarzeneggers comment in shasta county underscored a fundamental problem with his governorship he really doesnt like governing at least in the tried and true nitty gritty sense of making government work effectively the only way it can in a checks and balances democracy
208063 dig in and get your hands dirty mostly in the privacy of the governors corner office in the capitol
208064 cajole and coerce reward and punish do favors so theyll be returned use the awesome powers of office to sign and veto bills appoint a key legislators law partner as a judge place a lawmakers loyal contributor on the local fair board so hell have choice rodeo seats
208065 particularly important help raise political money for legislators of your own party
208066 and schmooze using all that gubernatorial mystique and in schwarzeneggers case charm
208067 with only one or two exceptions schwarzenegger doesnt like to hang out with these people doesnt seem to understand that its not about personality its about business he has virtually no relationship with any republican other than the two gop leaders and even those connections arent cozy thats unfortunate because the gop governor needs at least some republican votes six in the assembly two in the senate to get any budget or tax increase passed
208068 the arrangement apparently legal allows the senate leader to solicit unlimited funds for his own political agenda without having to detail how the money is spent
208069 he may have found a loophole in the political reform act that needs to be closed said attorney
208070 here is money being spent to influence the legislature and we dont know how much or how its being spent
208071 numerous legislators solicit money for charities or community groups a practice that has drawn scrutiny in the past because it allows special interests to curry favor with lawmakers
208072 peratas effort differs from most of the charity fundraising because the california rebuilding foundation receiving the cash was set up for political purposes and is promoting his legislation
208073 at peratas request the california correctional peace officers association donated 100 000 recently e amp j gallo winery 50 000 california alliance for jobs 25 000 california school employees association 10 000 and other interests 15 000 state records show
208074 perata is not required to disclose any solicitations of less than 5 000 to the foundation which he helped form last year the foundation is run by officials of polka consulting sandi polka is peratas longtime political adviser
208075 for the prototype of some of those changes they point to the campaign for proposition 2 which would require most farm animals to be able to fully extend their limbs or wings and fundamentally alter many commercial farming processes
208076 the yes on 2 campaign has been aggressive in its online strategy both in fundraising and as a way to rally activists they have hired deans online guru
208077 trippi says the approach taken by the yes on 2 campaign cannot work for every initiative but the tactics could help transform proposition politics in california
208078 to have a successful online campaign you need two things says trippi
208079 capitol worker bees have bigger problems to deal with right now but employees of termed out members often have their next job hunt in the back of their minds many dont know who they will next work for but they do know that their current employment is finite
208080 some junior staff feel less confident however that they will automatically will be selected for a new office and they worry about the future of their employment at the capitol
208081 people are nervous especially the first timers are worried theyre just feeling their way through hoping to land someplace good
208082 theres a tendency to feel pressured and have a sense of urgency but its still very early in the process
208083 the support by 51 percent of residents polled this month by the public policy institute of california represents a shift caused by renewed republican advocacy for drilling as well as motorists reaction to soaring pump prices according to the pollster
208084 with high oil prices and calls from president bush and republican presidential aspirant sen
208085 but as the price of oil hovers around 120 per barrel double the cost a year ago support for drilling has increased even among democrats and independents says the survey of 2 504 adult residents polled across the state july 8 22
208086 across regions support for drilling is highest in the inland empire 56 central valley 55 and orange san diego counties 54 residents in los angeles are divided 48 favor 47 oppose and residents in the san francisco bay area 54 oppose more coastal oil drilling
208087 the ban has already attracted the attention of marin county leaders who may push forward with their own proposal
208088 the ban passed the san francisco board of supervisors on an 8 3 vote with some supervisors predicting it would be a
208089 whatever we can do to make this country a smoke free zone we should do it said supervisor
208090 the law will ban the sale of all tobacco products at pharmacies in the city including walgreens and rite aid stores big box stores like costco and supermarkets like safeway will still be allowed to sell tobacco
208091 proposition 11s approach to reapportionment cannot guarantee to fix our broken system therefore seiu will issue a no recommendation to our members on the measure and urge state legislators to develop a real solution
208092 his holden sv6 was allegedly laden with 5kg of drugs including two cannabis plants resting on the back seat the court was told
208093 a variety of interactive content and channels on a visually stunning worldwide map interface
208094 so to be able to sustain that performance for 60 minutes in a game is a part of conditioning its a part of mental toughness
208095 we have some personnel issues i wanted to cover with you today
208096 will oakley has a stress fracture in his foot that was sustained in the summer conditioning program several weeks ago
208097 we are certainly looking forward to sundays fan day our fans have been very supportive here and been very positive in terms of their support of our team whether its been the spring game or whatever i think that has certainly enhanced our ability to recruit and project a positive image about our institution and our program we appreciate that and we are pleased and happy to give our fans the opportunity to watch practice on sunday even though its our third practice and we will have minimal amount of stuff in
208098 i dont know that there is anything specific that i can say we didnt do last year that wed like to do this year i think our team got off to a fairly good start last year we were pretty well conditioned so a lot of the same things we did last year to establish the details of what we feel is important to playing winning football well try to do again this year i think our team is in a little better condition right now relative to the summer conditioning program weve had a very good off season we had a good spring practice the players have worked very hard this summer we feel a little bit better off where were at right now in terms of starting out at least from a conditioning standpoint obviously the players have been in the system for a year therefore they have a little more knowledge about whats expected of them and the system in general whether its offense defense or special teams
208099 i dont really think so i think just because we have a new coordinator we have a new play caller it doesnt mean we have a different offensive system there are some differences in the offense probably in the quality control type things we were able to improve on certainly the new enthusiasm and the new knowledge that jim mcilwain brought as the offensive coordinator has certainly helped us grow and develop as an offensive team and do some things that i think may feature our personnel a little bit better but we are going to have to learn that about our team as well especially the new faces that will contribute on this years team and as i said at sec media day their maturity relative to how they can learn their responsibility and sustain that with some kind of consistency and performance certainly will determine how many of those guys can contribute to the team and when
208100 well we really want to try and develop good habits with our players so that we dont have attrition on our squad i think that if you look across the board you will see a certain amount of attrition in most programs sometimes because of player choice and sometimes because principles and values of the program not being met to the standard of excellence that somebody in the organization has to determine how the organization is going to get represented and the standard of excellence that everybody is going to do their jobs so sometimes that creates situations where player dont sustain in a program but we want to try and continue to develop the players and the program now and compliment them with the best talent that we can recruit
208101 the biggest difference would be inside outside because i think the two inside linebacker positions have a lot of carry over relative to assignment and you almost cant play one without understanding what to do at the other the two outside linebacker position would probably be 70 percent same kinds of similarities we are going to start most of the young players except jerrell harris who has always played outside linebacker at inside backer hopefully we will be able to leave one or two of those guys at inside backer but because all of these guys have played some kind of defensive end or outside backer in their high school career maybe move them back where they might be a little more natural early in their career i think from our team standpoint we need to determine who can be an inside backer of our freshman to add depth and competition to what we have
208102 absolutely he has taken all the conditioning tests and done extremely well
208103 i think that is something that we always do we are always evaluating how we can get the best players on the field and if position changes are something that we experiment with sometimes to see if a guy can do certain things we like to do those things in the spring maybe there will be some opportunity to do that and move some guys around this fall but we do have a starting point we will have to evaluate it from there
208104 not at this time we will let you know if there are
208105 i think the more depth you have on your team the more competition you have and i think thats very healthy were looking forward to hopefully a lot of the backup players and younger players on our team creating this competition that will create some battles that will determine who will become the eventual starters as well as improve the quality of depth on our team
208106 i think one of things we always try to do is we determine from all of our opponents that we play whether its offense defense or special teams here are the things we are going to see we want to invest some time in camp and some time in spring practice and exposing our players to some of those things so it may not be specific preparation for a particular team but it may be like the quarterback zone option spread offense we have three or four teams that run some variation of that when we play against it so we are going to spend some days in fall camp practicing against that that doesnt mean were practicing against that team were practicing against that concept of offense for example the double synch defense or bear defense thats something that we dont play much but some of the people that we play play a lot that creates significant adjustment on offense we may not practice against a particular team but a particular front on defense i think there will be more of that done i think you can practice too much for a game the players get stale after awhile especially with the game plan probably two additional practices with some exposure to some of the things a team does thats different from what they normally see would be the max that we would want to try and practice
208107 he is a part of the 105 as it stands right now his appeal was denied so he is not eligible to play what his family decides to do relative to that and pursuing it further with the ncaa is strictly up to them
208108 i think dave hart is certainly an outstanding administrator he has done a fantastic job at several places where he has been athletic director and i am sure he will be a very positive strong addition to our already strong athletic department that we have right now we are very pleased and happy to have somebody with his knowledge and experience coming in to join our athletic administration and i am sure hell benefit it in a very positive way and compliment the people we have now
208109 politicising the olympics runs against the olympic spirit and the shared aspirations of people all over the world
208110 it is inevitable that people hold divergent views on issues but politicising the olympics will not address those issues
208111 hosting the olympics is a century old aspiration of the chinese people
208112 as beijing finally became the host of the olympics after 100 years of longing all chinese people cherish this golden opportunity
208113 whether before the beijing olympics or after the games we will as always welcome foreign journalists and facilitate their reporting
208114 we will build a comprehensive welfare society benefiting a billion of our population so as to realise national modernisation and the common good of all chinese people china still has a long way to go
208115 these ratings are worse than we had on the eve of losing the majority
208116 dont be afraid to say you are disappointed in fellow republicans dont hesitate to be anti washington d
208117 mr holbrooke undertook on behalf of the usa that i would not be tried before this tribunal
208118 in a word become invisible long enough for the dayton agreement to be implemented in full
208119 that i get out of the way and go to russia greece or serbia and open a private clinic
208120 it is clear that unable to fulfill the commitments he had undertaken on behalf of the usa he holbrooke switched to plan b the liquidation of radovan karadzic
208121 the agreement which should have brought me peace and freedom thus became a source of great danger to my life and to the life and safety of my family and even my friends
208122 i do not know how long the arm of mr holbrooke or mrs albright is or whether that arm can reach me here
208123 such a deal never existed there has not been any attempt to drop the charges
208124 both holbrooke and i were actively involved in the 1990s in an attempt to get nato to intervene to have him arrested this failed but that is another story
208125 who had fooled us and rummaged through our archives without legal protection
208126 it then became clear to me that i could not come before the tribunal because the conditions for a fair trial would not be met
208127 unknown civilians showed me a badge so quickly that i could not identify it took me out of a public transport vehicle and held me in an unknown place for 74 hours
208128 australia will approach the discussions in the nsg in the same positive and constructive manner that it approached the iaea deliberations
208129 after careful consideration australian government has formed the view that the safeguards agreement is a positive step which will strengthen nuclear non proliferation efforts and is consistent with the non proliferation objectives of the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt
208130 the agreement will expand very significantly the application of international safeguards to indias nuclear facilities
208131 committed to universal adherence to the npt australia will continue to encourage those states not party to the npt including india to join the treaty
208132 not 100 some of her heart still belongs to frapp and
208133 every now and again she beats him with an umbrella or throws her
208134 this just confirms that shes letting him chew on her fish jerky
208135 id come home from the first meeting and told mom we werent having it because no one was interested
208136 she said if we stop it well never have it again
208137 we have about the same things every year i just like going uptown sitting around and watching people have fun
208138 since ive been helping with it ive enjoyed it more and ive encouraged my own daughter to get involved i guess being on the board has kind of helped me come out of my shell
208139 i think that sometimes parents think that if you are not a resident of burlington junction you cannot enter
208140 its the one time of year that burlington pulls together as a community
208141 we have other things but this one is really for the whole community its cool to see everybody out doing things and enjoying themselves we just seem to all work as a community during this
208142 i believe this is one of the best times we have in the summer
208143 i think everyone should come out take part in it and have a good time with us
208144 as with all elections it is important that voters express their opinions at the polling place
208145 be sure and have identification ready and be prepared to choose a party ballot
208146 any device capable of storing information in digital or analog form
208147 written materials commonly referred to as pocket trash or pocket litter
208148 how can i just get over it and move on
208149 why is it so hard to just forgive the person who abused me and get on with my life like everyone is telling me to do
208150 will god ever forgive me of my sin of being abused
208151 i received three different emails about this workshop when i read the third one i figured i was supposed to come
208152 i didnt realize there were folks like you doing that excellent work on spiritual healing the wounds that are caused by abuse
208153 i have not been able to acknowledge to anyone the abuse i have suffered
208154 i have learned that i am not alone i can take the risks with gods help
208155 she bawled like a baby after she got it cut the first time
208156 i told her it would grow back im so proud of her and i think about the little kids that are blessed by her donating he hair
208157 when we sat together at the rec center district board and volunteer board to discuss a paid chief it was monumental being part of that process with representatives from every division was pretty cool
208158 young boys in sexual positions performing sexual acts some boys were bound
208159 he was wearing only a diaper at the time of his arrest in his vehicle at that time was rope baling twine scissors and a g i joe doll
208160 the matter was reviewed sales in the ministry today and it is hereby clarified that there would be no restrictions in releasing lpg connections by oil marketing companies omcs these omcs would continue to enrol fresh applications and release the connections
208161 the three firms have decided to resume issuing new connections
208162 when bud johnson writes or quotes a slam on black women when he questions our blackness you better believe black women have every right to scream enough and we should were the ones holding the black community together and the thanks we get for that is cheap little smears our mothers our grandmothers our great grandmothers and on and on got the same thing as well we havent had the luxury of dropping out of the larger culture to avoid discrimination weve faced discrimination in our communities faced abuse in our own families weve overcome very real odds and still have a long long way to go but we dont get thanked for that instead we get questioned its tired its old centuries old and it needs to stop
208163 it is another example of hateful sexist language being used on the campaign trail and now is our moment to make it clear not on our watch
208164 this is about beginning the grinding and painful process of rooting out this kind of hate language and behavior whenever and wherever it exists the democratic leadership have pledged to unhinge our nation from gender bias hate language and misogyny and we are taking them at their word
208165 well youre the majority so how could you be discriminated against
208166 it isnt just hillary clinton who needs to learn a lesson from this primary season its all the people who crossed the line and all the women and men who let them get away with it
208167 well create a new sanction for interracial couples and leave the marriage issue to the churches
208168 clinton is a woman far from feminism her covering and being a beard for billy the goat had nothing to do for feminism that i can see of course there is sexism that is differnt than being sexually oppressive
208169 still he gave the clearest indication yet that conditions in iraq would allow him to begin reducing the number of american troops there before he leaves office in less than six months
208170 he repeated what the pentagon had already announced troops deploying to iraq beginning today will serve 12 month tours rather than the 15 months they were expecting
208171 there now appears to be a degree of durability in gains
208172 i think were getting things right most of the time now
208173 our footprint of activity now extends from mosul to basra

208185 should formerly respectable mid market tabloids distort the truth and ask loaded questions of their readers in order to advance thinly veiled racist agendas that bear a striking resemblance to bnp talking points
208186 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
208187 we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain who has fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
208188 weve seen this happen before and were not going to let it happen to us
208189 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
208190 were not going negative in return were refuting the charges
208191 its a great ad and everybodys talking about it and were having a great time with it
208192 we didnt draw first blood i mean this campaign has been rough and tumble since the day barack obama got his nomination and weve withered under the attacks of the obama campaign on a daily basis
208193 its increasing every month and you cant keep going back to them every month

208199 bij deze vaartuigen komen we meestal niet veel problemen tegen
208200 we hebben de laatste tijd wel heel veel werk aan de speedbootjes gastjes van twaalf die op snelle bootjes varen bijvoorbeeld een bestuurder van een snelle boot die harder dan twintig kilometer per uur kan moet achttien zijn en een vaarbewijs hebben
208201 het blijft een kat en muis spelletje we zijn redelijk herkenbaar en tegenwoordig met die gsm tjes sturen die jongens elkaar snel een sms je klik klik en ze weten dat we eraan komen
208202 en el mundo existe la tendencia de imponer penas efectivas para quien conduzca en estado de alicoramiento o para quien lo haga a altas velocidades debido a que las sanciones administrativas no son suficientes frente a las infracciones de tr nsito

208209 the average rand us dollar exchange rate for the period 27 june 2008 to 31 july 2008 was 7 6814 compared to 7 9352 during the previous period
208210 we might see oil prices go to the 112 or 115 level
208211 however supply side risks are still prevalent demand growth out of asia is still strong and non organisation of the petroleum exporting countries opec has slowed production
208212 its increasing every month and you cant keep going back to them every month
208213 the market is selling off because of the weak economic numbers out of the u s
208214 growth and oil demand is slowing in the u s europe and japan and its too optimistic to think emerging market demand will compensate for that
208215 the overall momentum on crude oil has clearly changed from the dynamics of the first half of the year
208216 were concerned what happens to newspapers but we have two huge growth vehicles in education and cable
208217 the market is selling off because of the weak economic numbers out of the u s
208218 growth and oil demand is slowing in the u s europe and japan and its too optimistic to think emerging market demand will compensate for that
208219 the overall momentum on crude oil has clearly changed from the dynamics of the first half of the year
208220 we continue to be in the midst of a major transformation within an industry that itself is undergoing significant change
208221 some will have you believe that the wage gap for women is a myth that we already have laws in place to make pay discrimination on the basis of gender illegal
208222 but just because something is illegal does not mean that it does not continue to happen
208223 isnt needed to protect women from wage discrimination such protection is already found in the law
208224 at the end of the day this bill will invite more lawyers to file more lawsuits because it offers them a bigger payday
208225 the bill before the house treats pay discrimination as systemic
208226 this bill does little more than dole out favors to the democrats trial lawyer allies with no new benefit to protect workers
208227 more difficult and error prone and invite a surge of litigation
208228 senator john mccain is a man of extraordinary integrity who i believe has and will always put our country first
208229 writing and recording raisin mccain is my contribution to his campaign its my hope that this song will unite young conservatives rally support and excitement for our republican presidential candidate and ultimately inspire people to vote
208230 well were all just raisin mccain everywhere across the usa you can get on the train or get out of the way were all just raisin mccain

208241 anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide have been identified as playing a major role in global warming the efficiency of the new units will be greater than the plant efficiency of the existing kingsnorth power station thus the new units will emit less co2 per gwh of electricity produced than the existing kingsnorth power station

208250 the situation came to my attention when a man inquired about the purchase of the church at that location
208251 so i looked into it the signs been taken inside it hasnt been used for quite a while i call the utility companies and they said those services have been shut off for some time
208252 the utilities had also been shut off at the house which was used for housing ministers
208253 the water at the house was back on i was told because they were going to sell the house and someone was living there
208254 if they are no longer using the church for services and there is no longer a minister living in the house it can no longer have exempt status they have no minister no services i need to know if i need to do more investigation or put it back on the tax rolls
208255 i move that it all be put back on the tax rolls because it is not being utilized in a manner that would constitute exemption
208256 i move it is all all the property put back on the tax rolls until they can prove that it is tax exempt
208257 if they arent having services the church is not open and there is no minister it kills their tax exempt status
208258 one of the big issues we see again and again in talking to businesses is where can we get the workforce is the workforce going to be ready when our facilitys ready
208259 our greatest needs are in three areas construction workers trained construction workers process operators and maintenance technicians
208260 your child were not saying that he shouldnt go to college but we have jobs that range from fifty to a hundred thousand dollars and they dont go to college they can be making by the time theyre 20 21 years old
208261 the downside is that these jobs arent the kinds that made the stuff of network sitcoms you wont be worrying about suits and ties
208262 the fcc is scheduled to vote on friday to tell comcast to stop throttling internet traffic to customers using certain file sharing services such as bittorrent mr martins proposed order would require comcast to submit any new network management techniques to the fcc for approval and to provide more consumer disclosure

208264 we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
208265 i think people for some reason think hes lazy and a bad teammate and that he doesnt care
208266 hes none of the above does he do some goofy things absolutely he does do some goofy things but as far as preparation and knowing the game and wanting to win theres no way you put up those numbers year in and year out unless youre a special talent and work at it and he does both
208267 its nice to see weve done something like this to make a push for the next two months
208268 hell be just fine manny is really a simple person he works extremely hard he just wants to play baseball and go home and be with his family how can you not respect and love a guy like that
208269 theo reached out to me in midmorning and wanted to gauge our interest and i said you know what we have an interest then we probably spent the next two plus hours hammering it out this wasnt on the board for very long
208270 manny being manny can also mean hell hit a lot of home runs and drive in a lot of runs
208271 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
208272 mannys certainly not a simple personality thats for sure hes complex but ive seen him when he competes
208273 ive had some colorful personalities on my clubs like david wells and jimmy leyritz if you feel somebodys going to help your club youve got to find a way to make it work and thats my job its a challenge but i look forward to it
208274 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
208275 andrews story his passion and his hard work in the state senate are going to make him a great u s senator who focuses on what is best for oklahoma families
208276 i feel very fortunate to have these talented experienced and dedicated campaign specialists on my team as we launch our stretch drive to victory on nov 4
208277 his two fingers are pretty mashed but were figuring out a way to shoot
208278 two fingers are pretty smashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it
208279 to build a society free of violence fear intimidation hate patronage corruption and founded on justice fairness openness transparency dignity and equality
208280 to a dialogue with each other with a view to creating a genuine viable permanent and sustainable solution to the zimbabwean situation
208281 weve had overwhelming response from all our clients in all the markets that we have launched the green real estate guide in singapore we have embarked on a client engagement programme it has been well received and some of our clients have progressed to do a green building audit
208282 green mark buildings typically would be slightly more expensive some of the materials you are sourcing such as recyclable materials are more expensive and not readily available so again it boils down to the cost as well as the timing a lot of developers are always trying to find the fastest way to complete a building at the most minimum cost
208283 we were tense whether we would be able to see todays eclipse or not as it was very cloudy a lot of people have gathered here to watch the eclipse we hope more people would come and see it
208284 the state government shall provide all logistical support from lakhanpur to the cave shrine both from baltal and panalgam routes and the running of the yatra will continue to be the responsibility of the shri amarnath shrine board sasb
208285 the role of sasb has not been diluted in any way whatsoever and the management of the annual yatra will be among its duties
208286 the approval today of india specific safeguards agreement by the international atomic energy agency iaea board of governors is a key step towards implementation of the us india civil nuclear cooperation initiative we will work vigorously with india to obtain an india specific exception in the nuclear suppliers group and the final us congressional approval
208287 our program encourages consumers to dispose of unwanted electronics in an environmentally responsible manner
208288 reflects lgs global sustainability initiative that also encompasses energy conservation reduction of hazardous substances and responsible product designs
208289 i work odd hours and i always work overtime and i never know when thats going to be
208290 i work downtown once or twice a week and the rest of the time in latrobe
208291 i hate to pay the money for gas but i just have to have my car
208292 i have an annual pass and ive never calculated it but i know its a substantial savings with parking and gas
208293 im just worried that theyre going to go on strike
208294 in that respect the negative cash flow in the second quarter is overstated
208295 were going to get the second quarter behind us and just move ahead
208296 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations
208297 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients we have a responsibility to take a leadership role on this major health issue
208298 we have a further responsibility to treat the whole patient both mentally and physically allowing patients to use tobacco products while in our care defeats this purpose
208299 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients we have a responsibility to take a leadership role on this major health issue
208300 we have a further responsibility to treat the whole patient both mentally and physically allowing patients to use tobacco products while in our care defeats this purpose
208301 our decision to go tobacco free is not an attempt to force anyone to quit smoking
208302 rather the tobacco free initiative is a concrete way we can demonstrate our ongoing commitment to healthy living
208303 congress should not adjourn until weve done something to bring down the high cost of gasoline
208304 i dont see how the leadership can adjourn when the folks back home are looking to us to help them with their gas prices and grocery prices they are struggling to meet their familys needs and congress should be helping them
208305 i am also an original cosponsor of the american energy act an all of the above energy strategy developed by members of the house republican conference
208306 republicans are asking for a simple up or down vote on this bill before congress adjourns
208307 none of these votes led to more domestic production but my legislation would take this decision out of the hands of congress and place it back where it belongs with the residents of the state of alaska
208308 this is much too long to leave americans hostage to the gas pumps
208309 exploting our suffering at the gas pump as an excuse to represent big oil
208310 every informed person knows there isnt enough oil in anwar to dramatically impact the price of gas
208311 the study also predicts a 2 to 6 percent decline in market share for all imported liquid petroleum products
208312 this means the price per barrel of oil would fall between only 41 cents and 1
208313 due to the plunge in stock market as well as concerns over dong high inflation and high interest rates all these have impacted the residential market prices have started to decline
208314 but in vietnam you have high interest rates now so costs have gone up and also a number of people who invested in the stock market have seen their wealth erode
208315 in terms of stock its got less than a million square feet compared to the asia pacific region it has the lowest number of grade a office stock
208316 for any mnc looking into vietnam they have less than ten good class buildings to look into and the majority of the buildings are virtually full
208317 overall we expect the office rental to continue to grow at a more modest rate of about 5 to 8 per cent on per annum basis
208318 it is important for us to ensure that the safety message filters down to every level of the workers sometimes when the economic activity is high workers tend to be in a hurry and safety tends to be neglected
208319 sometimes complacency will set in and that will lead to accidents these accidents many of them are avoidable
208320 we have to ensure that their foreign workers health is looked after the place is hygenic and it doesnt create public health problems it is also important for us to ensure that their morale is high and will be able to be productive if they are given proper housing
208321 it was in excellent shape to be made in 1888
208322 we thought it was cuill and is the brainchild of ann patterson ex google engineer whose last search engine technology was itself bought by google in 2004 and incorporated in its own system
208323 speech but analysts say this is the first time and probably not the last that they are up against one of their own
208324 this is one of the most unimaginable things to actually happen to a child
208325 this woman may have given birth to the little boy but she is no mother to have done things like this
208326 this child was brave enough to tell the truth and thankfully the jury believed that truth
208327 you knew didnt you there could be no pregnancy since you had a tubal ligation and a hysterectomy years before
208328 she has had a hard life but has a supporting family and can fulfill all the requirements of probation if you recommend it
208329 we can be here for hours and hours to talk about all the bad things she has done but if you recommend probation she can walk out of this courtroom and go down the elevator with you
208330 get over the idea that only children should spend their time in study be a student so long as you still have something to learn and this will mean all your life
208331 ive always wanted to do that but insert excuse here
208332 im pretty sure youll be able to pick one up without a contract
208333 leapfrogs web site is a premier resource for helping consumers pick the safest highest quality hospitals
208334 the redesigned site makes it easy for families to see which hospitals have the best track records treating certain conditions and which are the most committed to preventing dangerous errors
208335 for the first time ever in addition to seeing how well a hospital performs certain procedures consumers can know how efficiently they perform them costs at a hospital that provides both high quality and high value may likely be lower than at others
208336 we are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation
208337 if a man is caught with a pet the pet will be immediately confiscated and the man will be forced to sign a document pledging not to repeat the act
208338 it was exciting not many people get to go to d c especially to meet the president and get escorted by police multiple escorts everything everyone had a blast
208339 he said a lot of things ill probably remember for a long time
208340 everyone needs to know that were grateful here but we wish that we could be seeing the president for different reasons other than losing friends
208341 makes fun of shakespeare but at same time is an homage to shakespeare and to the theater and the elizabethan theater in particular
208342 we communicate the stories with energy clarity and invention and we distill rather than embellish the language and action we challenge ourselves and our audiences to take a fresh look at what is essential in shakespeares plays
208343 teens who do not participate in afterschool programs are nearly three times more likely to skip classes than teens who do participate
208344 they are also three times more likely to use marijuana or other drugs and they are more likely to drink alcohol smoke cigarettes and engage in sexual activity
208345 there was a time when there were few afterschool programs and what was available was more likely to be activities a cheerleading group here a chess club there
208346 we are making progress the number of afterschool programs is growing but we still have a long way to go and the programs we have do more to provide the range of supports and activities that students need today than in the past in many cases afterschool programs engage students who may not be doing well in school by offering field trips mentoring opportunities to try art and music physical fitness and sports career exploration and much more as well as the homework help that students need
208347 was mainly attributable to lower sales from development projects in china
208348 sales in china were lower as a result of re scheduling of some of the planned residential project launches
208349 remains confident of asias long term fundamentals and that it will grow at a relatively faster pace than the rest of the world
208350 despite the cautious market sentiments we have a positive outlook as our business units are competitively positioned and geographically diversified
208351 transnet took all their tariffs and inflated them by the same percentage we havent done that we treated each pipeline individually and thats why some are 0 and some are more than 7 73
208352 hypothetically if the costs are not passed through it will mean the oil companies are paying the increased tariffs but they are not recovering that from the motorists so they the oil companies will be out of pocket
208353 and the price at the pump like a sandwich is made up of many layers and transport costs are just one of the layers now normally petrol prices dont include factions of a cent so we arent quite sure how the minister is going to deal with this
208354 it is not possible to recover revenue from motorists for the previous four months therefore the increase will be recovered over the remaining period of the applicants financial year ending march 2009
208355 this breakdown is a repetition of the cancun stalemate of 2003 and implies that the promotion of international trade remains a distant goal for many national governments unfortunately the major losers will be the developing countries
208356 the status quo now remains for the foreseeable future this means that south african exports will continue to face competition from subsidised products from other countries with the collapse of the wto talks the possibility of redressing the imbalance in the global trading system in favour of developing countries is also put on ice
208357 what theyre bush and mccain going to do is try to scare you about me hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
208358 what does that mean if its not a suggesiton that his race is going to be used against him
208359 the approval today of india specific safeguards agreement by the international atomic energy agency iaea board of governors is a key step towards implementation of the us india civil nuclear cooperation initiative
208360 we will work vigorously with india to obtain an india specific exception in the nuclear suppliers group and the final us congressional approval
208361 till now no proof of sabotage or use of explosive has come to our notice however the inquiry report will establish the cause of the fire
208362 we were fast asleep suddenly we heard a commotion and i saw people running helter skelter there was fire in the bogie and it was spreading fast
208363 nu middenin de zomer uit de meerderheid stappen heeft weinig zin
208364 de kolderbrigade is er nu ook in geslaagd de vakantie van de excellenties te redden
208365 el cementerio est lleno de indispensables pero si el pueblo los productores agropecuarios y la federaci n agraria me lo piden lo pensar a pero en este momento ni lo pienso
208366 seg n los ltimos elementos no ser posible dar una fecha exacta de la muerte
208367 larry why do you think the state would have to approve a chicago style privatization deal for the city if the issue for you is mainly about upfront lump sum versus spend as you
208368 since quiet hybrids are running on electric speed governors could kick in at intersections or when pedestrians are around probably better to cut the speed limits especially at
208369 air horns amp squeaky brakes got to get over the volume of the ipods
208370 mike i have loud squeaky breaks i fixed them and end up startling a lot more people when i came to a stop at crosswalks i feel bad when i scare people so now that they have
208371 another advantage of small light transit vehicles is that for higher speeds the rails do not have to be as straight as for large heavy vehicles
208372 i think there are only three things america will be known for 2 000 years from now when they study this civilization the constitution jazz music and baseball
208373 i understand thats what sells movies i couldve done with more music and less sex and drugs i actually would have liked to have seen more of ray charles and what he brought to the table
208374 jazz has always been a major part of the festival with four to five concerts each season
208375 weve been privileged to hear the greatest musicians in the world play and newman and fuller are certainly among them
208376 no i dont think i have a title i dont even have a business card
208377 my involvement with pauline began when she and musician stuart dempster had gone into a cistern on the olympic peninsula at fort worden in washington state and discovered that it had an echo which lasted for about 54 seconds
208378 and since the cistern was round the echo kept on going and going and going so it was like an infinity of perception
208379 so many of these artists did rebel and confront what they considered to be a stifling society so they felt compelled to create worlds that were lively and vital and rebellious
208380 has been reduced to a set of crude geometric shapes a tribal mask rather than a portrait
208381 i think theres two things in play that weve seen this year that have really helped
208382 i think the maturity factor the learning the knuckleball the consistency of his knuckleball i think the commitment to his knuckleball tim wakefield doesnt throw 2 and 0 fastballs you have to be able to throw a 2 and 0 knuckleball or else youre going to get hammered and charlie has finally i think found the conviction to throw that knuckleball four fifths of the time
208383 he doesnt probably know exactly where its going i think that takes a lot of guts to do that i think thats the maturity side that were seeing
208384 i said to him last week when i had a lengthy chat with him that i expect he will announce that when he is ready to do so dr nelson said yesterday
208385 i talk to peter and others on my front bench frequently and peter has been extraordinarily supportive
208386 peter and his family have got the right to make the decision as to whether he stays or goes mr turnbull said
208387 of course he said earlier in the year he was going to retire from politics if he wants to change his mind he is entitled to do so in his own good time and he will let us know in his own good time
208388 peters calling is politics no matter what he might say about about the private sector one liberal said
208389 the journalistic photographer can have no other than a personal approach and it is impossible for him to be completely objective honest yes objective no
208390 i feel genes photographs reflect a great turmoil they are captured between the shirt and the skin this camera anchored in the heart moves me by its integrity
208391 if people who think ever think about photography they probably think
208392 its increasing every month and you cant keep going back to them every month
208393 were thrilled to be able to feature these pictures in people
208394 they will delight our readers who have followed the growth of the jolie pitt family

208399 well if id been born in america i probably would have been a businessman myself
208400 i managed to escape the soviet union but i was in a camp for a while and there was a guy there whos dying to get back to america
208401 russia is the future other countries will soon follow their model
208402 well ok ill go for a year or two and find out
208403 knows hudson and all of columbia county inside and out
208404 i was taught in school that hudson was once a whaling port because of the river i came back one time after moving away and hudson had grabbed on to the whale as a on their street signs its everywhere i asked a lot of people about it but nobody knew why the town was founded as a quaker utopia but later became known for its whorehouses thats very accurate when those got shut down in 1950 the town kind of died but now theres a fight between the natives and the new yorkers its still an open question whos going to win that one
208405 what we hear from our customers is that they really want the iphone not just because its a cool device but they want to do stuff with it and i dont think thats been catered for in the market so far
208406 we heard pretty loud and clear from customers that they want data one gigabyte per month is fair but its not generous we want customers who scoff at one gigabyte to have the option to get more
208407 reaches over to fill her hand with a shower of gold dried apricots
208408 an aviary of calling birds the color of apples and oranges tonight under the pitted planets
208409 but that was the night she gave over to space let the pulley of notes raise her as far as she could go and stayed
208410 slipped out of the bowl leaving only his glittering belt unbuckled
208411 the adoption of the online model is a step towards bringing about objectivity and accountability in the procurement activities
208412 instructions have been issued to all concerned for not revising the charges of cloak room and locker in railway stations the earlier circular regarding revision of cloak room and locker from august 1 is to be treated as cancelled
208413 despite continued uncertainty in the marketplace we exceeded our quarterly revenue guidance and our sequential growth once again outpaced our peer group in the second quarter
208414 due to the continued deterioration in the macro economic environment and sagging consumer and business confidence we are adopting a more conservative stance for the remainder of the year
208415 i agree that bollywood is a male centric industry but i expect the media to be intelligent if heroes who are over 40 are paired opposite much younger heroines it is not talked about
208416 but if i am romantically paired against heroes two to three years younger than me a big issue is made out of it it is really unfortunate
208417 but i think i am adaptable because i have a very indian face
208418 ranbir has even worked as an assistant director compared to them i have learnt everything while on the job
208419 in a male dominated industry what more can i ask for
208420 all his vital organs are working normally only the blood pressure is slightly high but there is no reason to be worried about that
208421 he was a veteran secular leader and his death is a jolt to secular forces
208422 surjeet had made significant contribution to the evolution of indian politics and the communist movement in india he would be missed dearly
208423 my association with surjeet began when we became friends in 1936 when i joined college he was already a stalwart by then i distinctly remember that my parents met surjeet for the first time in the jalandhar party office when they came to india after partition
208424 his contribution in setting the countrys political course was immense
208425 he was a great strategist a man with great political acumen and as one could see at the time of the united front government and also at the beginning of the upa government he played an important role
208426 i have come here to pay respect to my leader who fought for the common people he was a leader of the masses his demise is a great loss
208427 surjeet was a product of the freedom struggle his death is not a loss for the party or the left movement alone but it is a loss for the whole nation protecting democratic ethos of the country he fought like a true patriot
208428 the country has lost a great statesman who believed in pragmatic politics
208429 he was a grassroots political leader and played a pioneering role in empowering the peasants in punjab as a leader of the communist party of india and later the communist party of india marxist he played a vital role in defining and shaping their role in the politics of the country for nearly seven decades
208430 his pivotal role in the formation of the united progressive alliance will be remembered for long
208431 a freedom fighter farmers leader and an organisation man surjeet remained committed to the ideals and philosophy of communism all his life as general secretary of cpi m he was instrumental in the formation of various coalition governments at the centre in his demise the nation has lost a grand patriarch of national politics
208432 surjeets death is a great loss to the communist movement
208433 i dont know the problem but i know the solution is java
208434 xml is like violence if its not working you need more of it
208435 the thinking is its no longer our product and not necessarily indicative of how we do search
208436 unfortunately yahoo and jerry yang are getting pilloried in the press lately but i applaud their vision i think theyve got this right
208437 two thirds of all queries are done at web sites that arent search engines by definition
208438 in other words only a third of all search queries are done at the big sites like google yahoo and msn and others the rest are people at amazon looking for a specific item to buy and things like that
208439 everyone expects one big vendor will win in search thats just not true
208440 they are taking a very open approach letting people do what they want even changing how search results are displayed or presented
208441 thats very different from googles custom search where you dont have that flexibility and of course you have to use their branding and search box
208442 but we have too look more at how running their ads with ours would work also we already have vertical content you can access today that crawls very deeply for the kind of results our users want yahoo would be ancillary to what were doing
208443 the greatest advances of civilization whether in architecture or painting in science and literature in industry or agriculture have never come from centralized government
208444 when you walk in the place you feel like youre welcome like you become a friend
208445 youre not just a number to me thats the number one issue and its what i teach my staff thats why my key asset is my mother in law elisabeth
208446 today i am exercising my executive authority to avoid a full blown crisis and keep our state moving forward
208447 this is not an action i take lightly but we do not have a budget and as governor i have a responsibility to make sure our state has enough money to pay its bills
208448 i understand that this will affect people at a time when they are already struggling and so i want to apologize to all the state employees for having to do that
208449 when i sign this order thousands of pink slips will start going out across the state and im also cancelling all overtime except for public safety and 24 hour medical care and im ordering also a hiring freeze and effective for the august payroll tens of thousands of state employees will be paid the federal minimum wage until a budget is passed and then of course they will get reimbursed their salaries
208450 today i am exercising my executive authority to avoid a full blown crisis and keep our state moving forward
208451 this is not an action i take lightly but we do not have a budget and as governor i have a responsibility to make sure our state has enough money to pay its bills
208452 to empower locals and provide additional tactics to pressure warren buffetts pacificorp to remove the lower four klamath river dams
208453 weve been campaigning hard for five years and still the company refuses to take responsibility for the dams destruction of our fishery and communities
208454 these workshops are meant to get new blood from different walks of life to engage in direct action in our campaign to remove pacificorps klamath dams
208455 they are being held to prepare for the nonviolent direct action camp that will be conducted in orleans from august 22 to 24
208456 to empowering a new generation of young native leaders emerging across the continent who are bringing innovation creativity and inspiration to struggles to keep their homelands from becoming wastelands
208457 we dont want a lack of tactics or tools to slow down our effort to restore the klamath
208458 we have invited ip3 here to add some creativity to our campaign and help us think strategically about how to influence people like warren buffett
208459 as a european american you are the visitor in our country will you not meet with the native people impacted by your fish killing dams
208460 you say you want to address poverty and disease in the third world but you are creating those same third world conditions right here in america we want to meet and resolve the issue in a way that saves you money and saves our culture
208461 disrupting the shareholders meeting of the richest man on earth was very empowering
208462 i think that now its time for tribes fishermen and communities to all join together to let buffett know that as long as there is no business as usual on the klamath there will be no business as usual for berkshire hathaway or pacificorp either
208463 i really enjoyed going to the protest in omaha a lot of eyes were opened by our presence at the shareholders meeting
208464 we dont have a lot of time left the river is already low shallow and warm and every day the blue green algae on the river gets a little worse
208465 when i go to crescent city and other towns along the coast my heart goes out to the fishermen whose boats are tied up at the dock because of the salmon closure we cant wait for 20 years to restore the river we dont have that time
208466 trees dont grow in base they grow in regular water

208475 disastrous in the southern hemisphere where the catholic leadership exercises considerable influence on the politics of family planning
208476 theological or moral position but paid propaganda in favour of the use of contraceptives
208477 the spread of aids is totally independent of the religious denomination of populations and of the influence of religious hierarchies

208480 students in higher education are the future leaders of their communities yet significant numbers of them appear to hold beliefs which contravene liberal democratic values

208486 i believe it has been over 8 years since i last attended a meeting or have been notified of a meeting
208487 the corporation was created outside the auspices of the municipality to keep it free of government interference
208488 falls cable access is a private not for profit corporation completely independent of the municipality
208489 i have had no dealings with them since becoming village attorney in 1999
208490 all of a sudden the money is pouring in and we cant spend it fast enough
208491 based on the facts presently available to me and the applicable law my conclusion is that the fcac is not a legal arm or sub unit of the the village and therefore not an
208492 i have and continue to hold the belief that the fcac is a corporate entity separate and apart from the village the village cannot legally control the corporation
208493 do you turn all of your neighbors who try to do nice things in to the irs
208494 this is why people are after you as i struggle with 2 kids in college overcome health problems and continue to slide into debt it makes me sick that i have contributed more than 500 000 in services and 3 000 hours of services to this community
208495 if the village board attempts to take any of these funds and put them in the village general fund i will immediately begin charging for my services at the standard going rate for television program production
208496 falls cable access is a private not for profit corporation not subject to the open records request submitted by newspapers any request for information must come from the village of menomonee falls
208497 we will not be conducting an audit or review of the financial statements of menomonee falls cable access corporation and therefore we will not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on them
208498 it would appear that the corporation should have filed form 990 for each year of operation
208499 some anti abortion groups are taking a stand not only against abortion but also against contraception m any of them are now moving from the fringes into high ranking governmental positions where theyre making key decisions about reproductive health
208500 any of various procedures including the prescription dispensing and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
208501 more and more families are uninsured and under economic assault and our healthcare system is in crisis yet our president is taking steps to deny access to basic care this political rule change radically redefines the most common and effective methods of birth control as abortion as a result womens ability to manage their own healthcare would be held hostage by politics and ideology women spend 30 years of their lives managing their fertility defining birth control as abortion then trying to make it illegal and inaccessible destroys womens access to affordable healthcare options planned parenthood a leader in womens healthcare and advocacy wont stand by while the bush administration continues to deny women access to quality care
208502 the effects of ptsd and other mental health are profound
208503 left untreated they can result in severe depression an inability to function in society and in the worst instances suicide accordingly our commitment to treating veterans with mental health wounds should be no less vigilant than our commitment to those who sustained physical injuries on the battlefield
208504 the study demonstrates that our tight junction technology effectively delivers pyy into the body via nasal administration but that the peptide itself is not effective as a single agent for weight loss
208505 we are pleased that once again our delivery technology has effectively and safely delivered a large molecule via the intranasal route with good tolerability but disappointed that pyy did not show more promising therapeutic effect we believe our intranasal delivery technology continues to demonstrate value as a means of safely administering peptides and proteins and believe that pyy might still prove effective in combination with other weight loss drugs we would like to thank the investigators staff and patients who participated in the trial
208506 we have no comment today out of respect for the victims families there may be a time in the future when it is appropriate for us to speak but not today

208560 the plain fact is that washington is disappointed and has decided not to take him seriously the real washington needed to have a first hand look at the man they were being asked to deal with after general musharraf

208562 the washingtonians got the message that they were dealing with a non entity and should not take him seriously
208563 the level of discourse and understanding came crashing down to earth

208596 legally ethiopias occupation of eritrea is untenable it cannot be accepted by the international community i think our focus has been on the legal end and the diplomatic dimensions of the issue
208597 both regimes have used it as an excuse to enhance their domestic power at the expense of democracy and economic growth thus reducing the attractiveness to them of diplomatic compromise

208668 the arrest of karadzic has put him back on the political stage
208669 he has re emerged from the shadows and no one can be quite sure what effect that will have
208670 my arrest will mean the end of the bosnian serb republic republika srpska
208671 the division of bosnia that was mr karadzics dream is now more likely than at any time since he became a fugitive
208672 if it couldnt be destroyed in 1992 when the serbs attacked or in 1993 when the croats joined with the serbs to attack it it wont collapse now
208673 bosnia today is in its worst situation since the war because of the strength of nationalist rhetoric at every level of life

208676 in 1997 in eastern parts of nepal there were about 67 nests
208677 and in four or five years in 2001 there was zero
208678 so that rapidly they declined from india nepal and pakistan and over 12 years they started declining now more than 95 of the vultures number has gone down
208679 it is also anti inflammatory but has been tested against vultures and other birds of prey and general birds and does not cause damage to these birds
208680 yes they are ugly looking but they are really helpful for us
208681 see within half an hour they finished eating all that dead animal only the skeleton is left it is really helpful to clean the nature
208682 traditionally we see the vulture as a very bad bird
208683 if it passes your house then the house has to be purified they can bring danger
208684 but that belief is disappearing people realise that vultures eat rotten things and we must preserve them
208685 we tell them about the new medicine meloxicam and how we can save the birds by using it
208686 once we established the vulture restaurant in five or six months we found double that number the maximum number i have recorded is about 156 all at the same time on the same carcass

208695 today the court did not reach the required number of votes for a party closure but this decision is a warning to the party a serious warning
208696 such a decision is as bad as banning a party
208697 the sanctions say the party is guilty so its opponents will always label it as fundamentalist
208698 this result actually says the akp is not a secular party the judges have shaken the party and told it you have to work within our borders their hands have been tied
208699 this road will carry us to full membership of the eu
208700 there is no doubt that this process has given lessons to everyone and its no secret that the case has caused intense but constructive debate within the ak party
208701 that debate will inform how we go about our business in the coming months the new challenge for us and others including the opposition is to steer the country to compromise
208702 now for the next few months the akp will look very democratic and pro eu
208703 then they will sit down and say right to avoid another accident we need to change the make up of the constitutional court and put our own men everywhere in the bureaucracy then they will run the country in their own way
208704 i didnt vote for the akp but im glad it wasnt closed down that would have flung our country back 10 years

208709 my son satyendra went missing seven years ago he was 10 then it was 6am he was playing outside and then he disappeared i have no idea who could have taken him i have no enemies
208710 i lodged a complaint with the police they asked me to have 300 posters made with his photo they said they will put them up at all police stations in the city i did but the posters never went up i have no idea where my son is
208711 if police wanted they could have found him but theyve not helped me for seven years why would they bother now
208712 i dont think anyone can imagine 1 000 children going missing in london but it happens in delhi and the administration doesnt even take notice thats a very sad state of affairs
208713 there are two possibilities why children missing for even five or seven years are not found one the police are unable to find them two theyre not interested in finding them and i believe its the second reason
208714 the administration and police have class biases the poor dont have a voice so police dont register their cases they are very selective in registering cases and when they do register a case there is no proper investigation
208715 the police and administration react fast when a child from an affluent family goes missing we want the poor to get the same treatment they have the same rights we want all the missing children found we want the police to be more receptive to the poor
208716 we are demanding immediate registration of cases there should be a proper investigation and follow up in each case and we need to revamp the police administration
208717 children are our future if our future is lost what is left
208718 its a very serious issue the police have to create conditions that no child is lost and those who do go missing should be found immediately

208729 by being rather fastidious about the people in the clubs
208730 weve managed to control the particular atmosphere of the community
208731 many species seem to have ingrained homosexual tendencies that are a regular part of their society that is there are probably no strictly gay critters just bisexual ones
208732 did you know that bisexuality in animals serves as a peace keeping strategy i was reading bonobo the forgotten ape at the gym recently and it is just amazing what bisexuality can do to ease social tensions much like this awkward exchange were having now
208733 get out of my way you irritating brainless steaming pile of retarded baboon shit
208734 in todays market its imperative to have your home in the best shape and condition possible in order to get it sold and attract buyers
208735 starting from the curb make sure your home is one youd want to see inside
208736 making a list of items to check around the home this season and then actually following through with the tasks can help reduce home maintenance and utility costs
208737 paint or replace and take notice of missing screens or old storm doors add a new mailbox lighting fixture or address to add a new feel clean up the garage and landscaping
208738 clean out closets and cabinets providing as much empty space as possible
208739 pack away all personal items including photos the emptier your home the larger it appears buy a new bed in a bag for your bedrooms dust everything including the basement
208740 freshen the home by airing it out thoroughly and sanitizing baseboards woodwork floors and lighting fixtures
208741 a clean home is desired as it reflects the owners level of activity when it comes to maintenance and keeping up with the property
208742 your home should now give you the feeling of checking into a hotel decorated yet depersonalized and clean
208743 milh es de potes de papinha com a inten o de matar crian as
208744 si viese usted a atlas el gigante que sostiene al mundo sobre sus hombros si usted viese que l estuviese de pie con la sangre latiendo en su pecho con sus rodillas dobl ndose con sus brazos temblando pero todav a intentando mantener al mundo en lo alto con sus ltimas fuerzas y cuanto mayor sea su esfuerzo mayor es el peso que el mundo carga sobre sus hombros qu le dir a usted que hiciese

208746 tu coraz n es m s importante que tu mente
208747 nunca has escuchado otros conceptos morales que no sean los m sticos o los sociales

208749 susy i like the new highlights you put in your hair good choice
208750 susy i like the new highlights you put in your hair good choice
208751 i cant believe you noticed no one ever notices when i make subtle changes like that thank you
208752 yes i went to the lake and then to a concert saturday night what about you
208753 not much bob husband went fishing saturday and golfing sunday so i just kind of piddled around the house
208754 doesnt sound like much fun susy if you had your pick what would be your idea of a perfect weekend be what kind of things are most fun for you
208755 no one has ever cared enough to ask me that before probably to take a trip to look at historic houses stay at a bed and breakfast maybe see a show one night just get away from the busy life
208756 that would never happen to me i would never let it get that far
208757 dont have lengthy conversations with the opposite sex i dont care how innocent they are
208758 in a short time we caught hundreds of species 10 of which may be new to science it was unreal unbelievable
208759 catching is the easy bit the hard bit is going back to the lab and examining the species comparing them to collections and books seeing if they are new to science one hour in the field can equal hundreds of hours in the lab
208760 the expedition captured on film the discovery of the strongest candidates for new species two fishes
208761 it was quite a thrill luring this spider the size of a soup plate out of its hole and holding it although i can see that this wouldnt be everyones idea of fun
208762 we have a choice we really are at the cross roads now we can decide to keep these rich hotspots of nature or see them razed to the ground

208764 in the past certain irresponsible politicians in the north have accused southern serbs of collaborating with the authorities in pristina
208765 they do not or refuse to understand that the situation south of the ibar river is different
208766 i like to compare kosovos status to the weather you cannot support the weather
208767 i could be one of those people who adores the winter and goes out in a heavy overcoat on a day like this baking heat on the other hand i could adjust to the situation i am in
208768 since the unilateral declaration of independence many people here have been saving money to buy property in central serbia as a fallback option
208769 if the so called kosovan republic starts to impose its laws its language its teachers and its doctors on serb areas that will be the end of the serbian community in kosovo
208770 last night i was a trillionaire today ill be using coins
208771 one will an older candidate or older president have the energy and sharpness to do the job well and secondly theres a concern about whether an older president will have old ideas
208772 im older than dirt and ive got more scars than frankenstein
208773 i will not make age an issue in this campaign
208774 im not going to exploit for political purposes my opponents youth and inexperience
208775 because i get mixed feelings from people i have always had to defend him but its probably five
208776 i think that his message is a little bit more traditional and more pragmatic which makes it harder to appeal to voters on an emotional level
208777 and i think that you have to have that if you want to inspire people and get them motivated making sure barack obama doesnt get the nomination motivates us more than john mccains message which is a problem in and of itself
208778 one of the most common prejudices we have in american society is a prejudice against age
208779 young is always better old age is bad thats the prejudiced attitude and to paint mccain with a brush that says i can look at his age and know everything i need to know about him is just as wrong as looking at obama and saying i can look at his skin colour and know everything i need to know about him its not fair
208780 it depends who he picks for vice president i dont think his age makes any difference
208781 if he has to pick a special vice president then youre worried about his age sure you are

208783 homosexuality does exist in africa its not a western thing as our african bishops would want people to believe
208784 people began to send me death threats by e mail by text messages and it got so serious i had to flee nigeria to togo
208785 i am so grateful to the government of the uk for granting me asylum for giving me safety and for allowing me to be alive to continue my work
208786 i think they should open their ears to listen rather than doing the talking
208787 for people like me and my members to begin to come out to have pride in who we are i think change is coming
208788 the bishops need to know that what comes out of their mouths is affecting us and putting us in a very difficult situation
208789 last night i was a trillionaire today ill be using coins
208790 as we said yesterday we agree with david that the whole party should pull together take the fight to the tories and focus on dealing with the real issues affecting peoples lives
208791 the government is supposed to give us 95 861 they have only given us 19 354
208792 the free secondary education is really a challenge we have creditors we cannot pay them
208793 there has been an increase in the student population which means increasing the infrastructure so where do you get the beds the books with the peanuts that the government sends
208794 it should be understood that our system is a transformation it has its own challenges

208813 when we know ourselves when we see that god is the reason for our groaning then we achieve an insight that gives us confidence in the greatest and deepest sadness we see death in the light of life we justify god who by his spirit causes us to groan in this tent we see the necessity of death and of the no in transitoriness they are needed to free a place as they do their work true life comes closer we are closer to the goal of being clothed upon with our heavenly dwelling

208815 the credit crunch is having a much bigger impact on 30 year mortgages than anything the fed is doing with interest rates
208816 ive been through three recessions in 32 years this is the worst ever
208817 theres a credit crisis theres a tightening of credit standards and lending standards you have to have excellent credit to get a loan today

208830 vvv was in de aanval en tommie van der leegte beging een lichte overtreding door iemand vast te houden e n of twee seconden na het fluitsignaal trapte hij de bal uit de draai veertig meter weg waarna ik hem geel gaf en hij dat ook zonder meer accepteerde
208831 afellay kwam van twintig of dertig meter aangerend zei allerlei onvriendelijke maar geen kwetsende dingen en plaatste zijn voorhoofd vlak voor het mijne hij was de hele wedstrijd al aan het zeuren hetgeen ik bewust negeerde dit was een stap te ver waardoor ik besloot ook hem geel te geven en hem toevoegde je bent een vervelend typetje niks meer en niks minder dus totaal iets anders dan nu in de pers staat en afellay voor een of andere camera heeft geroepen
208832 ik vind het echt heel laag dat afellay dit doet tussen het eindsignaal en de strafschoppenserie zei hij al ik ga je pakken ik ga je pakken voor een camera in mijn optiek moeten afellay en van kouwen me wel verkeerd hebben verstaan ik fluit nu zeventien jaar in het betaalde voetbal en heb dit soort taal nog n it gebezigd als een speler vuile tyfushond tegen me zou zeggen gaf ik hem direct rood en hoopte ik dat de knvb hem hard zou straffen
208833 als er een onderzoek komt wil ik afellay en van kouwen graag in de ogen kijken het is heel vervelend als je van iets wordt beschuldigd dat je niet hebt gedaan
208834 maar ik ga nu eerst maar eens met de knvb in conclaaf welke weg we gaan bewandelen

208863 ik heb hem in een bootje neergelegd hij kon niet veel zeggen hij was natuurlijk enorm geschrokken
208864 vlak na de breuk wilde mijn ex partner geen contact meer met mij ik was er kapot van en ben veel te lang doorgegaan met het sturen van berichten ik zie nu in dat zij daar niet van gediend was maar ik hoopte dat ik haar nog terug kon krijgen

208881 eating seed is unacceptable but with no rain at all with a very long drought it has resulted in this
208882 the situation is very precarious and very terrible we have nothing left to plant
208883 when a farmer starts to eat seeds it means the end of life
208884 if you are at the point where you have to eat them you are not continuing for the future it is a big decision for someone to make it is a desperate measure
208885 if there is no rain the crops that we are looking at will dry out

208895 its obligations as a government to protect children and society as a whole from unjustified and destructive behavior
208896 through a society wide process of agreement internalization and normalization a series of
208897 given that law guides our behavior a policy that treats procreation as private is regressive environmentally damaging and peculiarly anti social it teaches us to disregard others and their interests until we have policies that reflect the truly public nature of having children we will encourage irresponsible procreation and all the harm it causes

208904 camera performance was mixed the f100fd is slow to start up making you wait around 2 5 seconds before you can take a photo the camera does focus quickly though even in low light situations
208905 with its 5x optical zoom lens wide 28mm lens setting 12 megapixel resolution face detection and host of well apportioned shooting tools the fujifilm finepix f100fd is a pretty good choice for the enthusiast and a daves pick in that category with the qualifier that you should take care to use flash in low light
208906 not every digital camera can be classed as outstanding the fuji finepix f100fd does a decent job without quite hitting the standard achieved by some of the other digital cameras i have tested recently
208907 the f100fd lost the aperture and shutter priority controls of the f50fd but gains the latest generation sensor and processor as well as a wider and longer zoom lens color and image quality is first rate and while the f100fd may perform a bit better with higher contrast images than earlier models thats not the only reason to consider the fuji in fact id rate it as one of the less compelling reasons good shutter performance stabilization that 28mm wide angle lens still the best high iso performance ive come across in current production point and shoots and a simple fairly intuitive layout and operation make this camera easy and friendly to use consider the wider dynamic range as icing on the cake
208908 we put the f100fd to the test in several high contrast situations to see if the wide dynamic range really makes any difference we have to say we were quite surprised to capture images that showed fine details even in the highlight and shadow regions owners manual press excerpt following the long line of award winning f series models fujifilm uk today announced the most accomplished model in the range yet the finepix f100fddigital camera combining a 12 megapixel 8th generation super ccd with a powerful fujinon 5x wide angle optical zoom lens a 2 7

208913 sebastian horsley a man who has absolutely nothing to declare but his own lack of talent he is a prat a wanker this book should be avoided by anyone of a nervous disposition or by anyone who has a fondness for the female sex the question that may enter the enquiring mind is this what exactly is the point of sebastian horsley do him a favour and bin it

208928 open source software has the potential to give individuals significantly more control over their own lives the trend toward special purpose devices and remote servers could reverse that
208929 so people use free software because of its guaranteed low cost because it does what its users want and because its trustworthy and they use web services because they get low system administration costs they can use huge databases without downloading them first they can get software updates quickly they can do very cpu intensive things and they can collaborate with their friends easily how can we get both of these sets of advantages at once
208930 were going to sit here and were going to point the finger and let the jury know that tracy holcomb killed brooklyn
208931 there is no direct evidence connecting mr holcomb to this crime it is entirely circumstantial
208932 i dont know if theres any direct evidence connecting the defendant because i havent heard the evidence
208933 the court will wait to see what the witnesses testify to at trial i dont see any other way the court can rule

208959 and then i am permitted only 250 words to tell them about how i used to love taco bell but how i m not feeling well now after having two bites of frijoles that were soupy and strange and how i had to go back to the counter twice to get them to remake a simple grilled burrito that was falling apart and disgusting and how the employee clearly didn t give a shit and that was why i decided i really didn t want him feeding me today so i demanded a refund and probably won t go back to taco bell for a decade or two

208962 one of the benefits of all grass fed beef or beef with benefits as we say is that its lower in fat than conventionally raised beef
208963 the other thing is that the meat and milk from grass fed cattle will probably have higher amounts of omega 3 fatty acids which may help reduce the risk of heart disease and strengthen peoples immune systems whats good for the environment whats good for cattle is also good for us
208964 what we know about soy is that as you process it you lose a lot of the benefits
208965 any soy based fake meat product is incredibly processed and you have to use chemicals to get the mock flavor any other whole food diet is going to be a lot better for you

208978 the club is officially recognising the long and outstanding service to both lancashire and to local sport by rewarding gary with a richly deserved benefit year in 2009
208979 some people might find it ironic that lancashire is rewarding a yorkshireman for outstanding service but it would be very hard to find a better clubman in sport
208980 gary has been a huge asset to lancashire both on and off the field his professionalism and dedication is unwavering and he is a firm favourite with both members and supporters
208981 we hope this will be a successful year for gary and he receives the support of cricket followers and members alike
208982 its a huge honour to be awarded with a benefit season and i would like to thank lancashire for this humbling acknowledgement

208984 people dont often think about all the ways farms support communities particularly urban or suburban communities
208985 farms play a crucial role in sustainability whether by providing fresh local food cleaner water wildlife habitat and other ecosystem services or helping to maintain the local economy the link to farms and farmland is so logical for this exhibit
208986 last fall aft released a podcast about the edible schoolyard at martin luther king jr middle school in berkley ca
208987 in their project urban students learn about organic gardening and have access to a kitchen classroom where they learn to prepare seasonal produce as a result of that podcast the exhibit organizers drew a connection between sustainable schoolyards and afts work to save farms and farmland that bring local foods to farmers markets restaurants and grocers thats how we became involved in the usbg exhibit
208988 this is the moment when we must come together to save this planet
208989 people think that perhaps spending at least 65 percent in the classroom is a good thing and it is

209028 youre right as far as the pressure and all the expectations that were put on me and that were put on myself for the fight in my hometown

209030 its always been a goal of mine to be in the upper echelon and i cant wait to compete with some of these guys
209031 i want to fight the best in the world and there are a lot of very very tough welterweights out there
209032 you can beat em up and they just keep coming hes definitely not an exception to that rule but on top of that i think hes a pretty good striker and hes shown himself to be pretty dangerous he knocked out blas avena and did pretty well against jason miller and i saw some of his other fights and hes a dangerous striker

209042 the big challenge is as you know getting the balance right between not having an economy that is plagued by high levels of inflation forcing interest rates up over the long term while ensuring enough activity continues to be generated in the economy
209043 maintain a tight policy stance until it is clear that inflation will abate
209044 they could change the target or they could flexibly interpret it
209045 we are of course fully aware of the possibility that people may fear that this temporary period of high inflation could in fact turn out to be persistent
209046 present macro economic circumstances are as testing as anything weve seen since the mid to late 1980s
209047 likely to remain markedly above the target until well into 2009
209048 i expect therefore that this will be the first of a sequence of open letters over the next year or so
209049 we may now be witnessing the death of inflation targeting
209050 it is in testing times that they do their work
209051 it is certainly going to take a significant amount of time to deal with the inflationary pressures in the australian economy that have been developing for a long period
209052 i want to tell you i myself did not want to be the president it was the people in the whole country who voted me in and wanted me to be the president i should not let the people throughout the whole country down
209053 full of hope western countries had cited the seoul games in 1988 as the model for the games in 2008 at the minimum the olympics in beijing were expected to trigger a similar opening of the political system as with democracy in south korea after long time military rule chinas winning of the olympic bid created expectations and hopes for change in china that it could not and does not want to fulfil
209054 the ideal of a walled world where nation states can trade with each other on global markets but maintain their control over their economic future their political system and their foreign policy is emerging as an ideological challenge both to the us philosophy of a flat world and the european preference for liberal multilateralism
209055 it is always possible to find some evidence in support of any generalisation no matter how outlandish
209056 western critics tend to assume that political legitimacy can be conferred only by elections
209057 rather the systems ability to respond to a wide range of problems to maintain social order to provide a steadily increasing level of public services and to increase chinas standing in the world are all important contributors to legitimacy
209058 the chinese especially the intellectuals lost their belief in their own country and culture and developed a kind of reverse racism
209059 they are seeing chinas economic development the increase in living standards
209060 they have more contact with the west they understand it better they speak more fluent english they know westerners are not really angels they realise that they are different from us not only in ideology but in national interests the younger chinese have learned a stronger sense of individual rights from westerners they are told by the west that media should be objective
209061 they are paid much less attention it is a lot more enjoyable to look at them like this as sacred buddhist texts say these grand objects in fact are all just piles of dust
209062 is using its status as the olympic host to strengthen its own legitimacy its paying a lot of attention to having western leaders come to beijing as if to worship or sacrifice to the emperors
209063 realises the problem of a lack of values in china
209064 selective aspects of traditional culture but also in doing so over emphasising the particularity of china
209065 chinas economic reforms in the propaganda sphere especially since the 1990s have been geared towards privileging party interests
209066 re strengthened and as dominant in chinese society as ever
209067 the abiding nature of the ultra stable system of autocratic chinese rule that deploys a mix of coercive power economic cartels and cultural ideology to maintain what is now celebrated as the countrys harmonious society
209068 the absence of genuine political choice and true freedom of the press as a result of the 1989 post tiananmen repression has created in effect a society perpetually on the edge of maturation the population of the urban boom areas is complicit in a relationship of negotiated repression with the ruling elites
209069 we are seeing the genesis of an american style starbucks and saks burbs culture

209125 im not concerned with my personal stats ive done enough where i dont need to concern myself with that so long as we come away with the victory no matter how it happens be it 1 0 50 1 thats my only concern
209126 everything he will bring to the field in terms of leadership communication talent to me thats everything milt stegall is about
209127 were always leery of him because hes probably one of the most dangerous players in the league
209128 were going to try and get him to the ground as much as possible
209129 knowing they have a tendency of throwing the ball kind of excites the defensive backs a bit
209130 it will let our defensive line get a good pass rush and put some pressure on the quarterback and maybe we can get some overthrown balls
209131 weve waited all year to personally try to get back at dinwiddie for stealing that one last year
209132 i dont know how much he has been tested yet but as a defensive line we have something to prove and were going to get after it

209136 dalam kondisi seperti sekarang ini mereka lebih banyak memasok kebutuhan air bersih ke sejumlah perusahaan menurut sejumlah sopir pengangkut tangki warga memang sangat membutuhkan air tetapi daya beli turun ya sejumlah warga bahkan memanfaatkan air tambak untuk mencuci
209137 kami membeli rp 10 000 per tangki atau rp 8 000 untuk langganan namun ya antre bisa mengangkut 5 kali sudah bagus soalnya saat seperti sekarang ini harus antre
209138 per hari para sopir itu bisa mendapatkan hasil bersih rp 40 000 hingga rp 100 000 solar kan kan mahal jadi hasilnya tipis kami juga harus setor ke juragan rp 10 000 ada yang rp 8 000 per tangki
209139 makanya kami saat ini lebih banyak memasok ke perusahaan diantaranya pt indospring dan pt behaestex satu sopir bisa memasok hingga tangki per hari
209140 kami akan mengirim air bersih ke daerah yang mengajukan droping namun ada kendala karena harus juga menyewa kendaraan tangkis air untuk mengirim yang dipunya pdam hanya dua unit
209141 sebenarnya stok formulir skpd masih ada sampai september 2008 tetapi karena nama pejabat yang tercetak dalam formulir itu sudah ganti untuk sementara kami menggunakan sspd
209142 sebenarnya secara pribadi saya nggak masalah jika menggunakan formulir yang lama kan sayang rasanya sisa formulir yang sudah tercetak senilai rp 2 miliar tidak terpakai namun banyak yang minta agar formulirnya diganti
209143 hitung sendiri saja rata rata sehari mengeluarkan 16 000 formulir per hari biaya pengadaan pencetakan skpd setahun sekitar rp 5 miliar
209144 mungkin akhir agustus ini diharapkan formulir skpd sudah selesai dicetak
209145 jadi tidak akan merugikan atau menyulitkan pemilik atau pembawa kendaraan di lapangan karena polisi pun sudah tahu jika skpd yang terlampir dalam stnk diganti sspd
209146 given the uncertainty in the real estate and mortgage credit markets we believe it is prudent to delay the split
209147 our primary focus at this time is expense management product development and maximizing profitability we will split the companies when we see more stability in our markets and when the outlook becomes clearer
209148 we think its wishful thinking that a rainbow is about to come up on the good ship lollypop as we have said in the past our expectations are for a continuation of a relatively stressful period before we can see the emergence of profitability sometime in 2010
209149 we believe that there would be some opportunities with other underwriters or other large operations across the country to perhaps consolidate

209157 il provvedimento adottato in sede del consiglio dei ministri a favore del voto in condotta determinante per la promozione alla classe successiva del corso di studi rompe in modo definitivo e positivo il tradizionale lassismo che ha caratterizzato per decenni la scuola italiana vittima di una cultura di sinistra che si e fatta promotrice in questi anni di un lassismo totale che e spesso sconfinato in una sorta di nichilismo estremamente diseducativo per le giovani generazioni
209158 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board

209163 last night i was a trillionaire today ill be using coins
209164 we continue to drive growth in the domestic motorcycle market despite all the prevailing constraints on account of the high interest rate regime and double digit inflation we will persist with our strategy of strengthening our brands and expanding new markets in semi urban rural and upcountry areas
209165 however managing high double digit growth in the post festive season will be a challenge and therefore the second half of the fiscal is going to be crucial for the overall growth in the industry for the year as we have maintained before we remain cautiously optimistic about the future
209166 in terms of putting any industrial combination together there is no discussion
209167 mtn is a great company great management that is the reason we thought it is a strategic fit and it is really their call it is not our call
209168 iran has asked us for gasoline supplies we are talking to them
209169 we are probably in for a couple of years of just nothing not good or bad but just nothing
209170 i dont think we are imminently poised for a collapse but i also dont think we are on the verge of a secular bull market in asia for at least another two years
209171 that probably needs to come down given that its almost for sure the u s economy will have another write down
209172 we are seeing multiple signs of demand destruction particularly in the u s
209173 the u s consumes 20 million barrels of oil per day all of asia including japan consumes 25 million barrel so if the u s is starting to consume less oil its extremely positive for oil
209174 if you think the oil price is going down then thats a great positive thing for india in the context of asia and i think we have seen the worst
209175 the decision to build the tiguan locally is an indication of the strategic importance of the russian market for the volkswagen brand
209176 for our customers the production of the tiguan in russia means shorter delivery times same quality standards and a very attractive price

209183 liz taylors publicist denies claims she was put on life support
209184 we passed clarabell who if he wasnt smoking a cigarette looked like he was while he swapped wisecracks with a member of the crew
209185 we are grateful to the washington post the new york times time magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years it would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years but the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government the supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto determination practiced in past centuries
209186 well its a well known fact that theres a secret society of the five wealthiest people in the world known as the pentavirate who run everything in the world including the newspapers and are known to meet tri annually at a secret country mansion in colorado known as the meadows
209187 his service to mumbai cricket has been phenomenal he was an excellent captain also he was a very humorous character who kept the dressing room very lively his death came as a big shock its a great loss to mumbai cricket
209188 we would have been happy to have got another 100 runs today
209189 we have to get another wicket early tomorrow which will expose the tail of course chaminda vaas can bat a bit we really have to go out there and bowl the same way we did today and field the same way we have to make sure we give our 100 per cent tomorrow and try to restrict them in the next 50 or 60 runs
209190 we are not satisfied with our efforts and we still have a long way to go tomorrow
209191 but luckily god gave us eyes to see through politicians ears to hear the lies noses to smell a rat tongues to taste the sweetness of democracy a brain to think for ourselves and hands to vote
209192 and im somewhere between trying to figure out which way the tide will take me
209193 we knew that indian plan was to attack me therefore there was no worries it was part of the game
209194 definitely the training that i underwent with the army that helped me remain confident
209195 indian battling line up is so used to play spin never intended to surpass muralitharan in wickets in this test it was never intended it was the occasion
209196 i am more focused on my training at the moment and whatever little time i get i spend with my family basically my life has not changed much
209197 i suppose that is the way the game goes these are the glorious uncertainties of cricket over all we had a good day
209198 perhaps we lost one too many wickets in the later part of the day but we are hopeful if we are able to get a partnership going tomorrow then we are back in the game it is going to be a close call
209199 we were expecting our middle order to do well we were expecting our two batters to get a big score on the board but still we are hopeful but we still have chaminda vaas to come in ajantha mendis and prasanna jayawardene are there and still mahela jayawardene is at the wicket so anything is possible
209200 9 11 would have been one of many harebrained schemes in the head of ksm
209201 in the last two games we have created several chances but either the opposition keeper has played really well to stop us from scoring or we have just missed the target
209202 there is no problem i am sure the goals will come and the important thing is that the players are creating chances
209203 when they have more sharpness they will score more goals at this stage it is all about preparing for the start of the season and i know that when the season begins my players will be ready
209204 i know we have the players to score goals last season fernando torres steven gerrard ryan babel dirk kuyt yossi benayoun and peter crouch all got double figures for us
209205 crouch has left but we have brought in robbie keane who also got double figures for tottenham so i am not concerned

209222 not only from public but also from party offices and completely disappear from the public arena not give interviews and not even publish literary works in a word become invisible long enough for the dayton agreement to be implemented in full
209223 that i get out of the way and go to russia greece or serbia and open a private clinic just as long as i left pale
209224 it is clear that unable to fulfill the commitments he had undertaken on behalf of the usa he holbrooke switched to plan b the liquidation of radovan karadzic
209225 the agreement which should have brought me peace and freedom thus became a source of great danger to my life and to the life and safety of my family and even my friends
209226 holbrookes wish for my disappearance is today still fresher and stronger and the actions aimed at bringing this about are tireless
209227 while these activities continue and with this threat to my life i have to sit in a place which is known to him and his friends and prepare my defence

209248 auch die alte bundesrepublik war gerechter ich lebe ja in einer stadt die von der linken seit einiger zeit mitregiert wird in berlin ist das zur normalit t geworden die politik die die linke zumindest mittr gt ist nicht ganz so schlecht wie die ihrer vorg nger mitunter aber auch zum heulen wenn die privatisierung der wasserwirtschaft in berlin kein s ndenfall war dann wei ich nicht was ein s ndenfall ist ich glaube aber dass die bundesrepublik vor neunzehn jahren eine gerechtere gesellschaft war als heute und das ist in meinen augen das problem ob die linke das ndern k nnte dar ber l sst sich wie gesagt streiten faz inwiefern ging es gerechter zu als heute typische faz frage kr jemand der aus dem westen kommt kann das sicher besser beantworten aber wenn ich heute jemanden treffe der quer durch berlin gelaufen kommt weil er die 2 10 euro f r die hinfahrt und die 2 10 euro f r die r ckfahrt mit der s bahn nicht bezahlen kann denn das entspricht ungef hr seinem essenssatz pro tag dann ist das gelinde gesagt eine unw rdige situation dieses hartz iv gesetz w re ende der achtziger oder anfang der neunziger undenkbar gewesen oder nehmen sie das gesundheitswesen das ist ein zweiklassensystem geworden auch in der bildung spielt geld eine wachsende rolle die ideologie der privatisierung die konomisierung aller lebensbereiche unterwirft alles einem kurzfristigen effizienzdenken das langfristig f r unsere gesellschaft bedrohlich ist
209249 it was fun when we were older too of course but when i was a child with my brothers that was really something
209250 we started playing country western but my brother loulou who played the drums complained because there nothing for him to do
209251 see load drums to that and you get rock and roll
209252 i know john lennon then playing backup for the tony sheridan band saw us perform a lot of the british did but id never dare say we influenced them
209253 i met him once and he was very kind to me i never got a chance to tell him what i thought that he was my hero
209254 this is one of the secret awards i wanted i was hoping this would happen in my lifetime and it did
209255 they dropped down the age to enlist to 18 i signed my mothers name and she was not happy about that
209256 i never turned down anything and never argued with any producer or director
209257 he has a passion for acting to survive a war that gives you enough determination that anything is possible he believes life will go on forever
209258 wow i tell you how many of us have ever felt the song you just sang there are so many girls saying wow he wrote that because he knows how i feel i hate it when they call you little because youre the biggest man in town
209259 every time a mother comes up to me and says proudly that shes a cougar its always a little unnerving

209261 i just love to go out and play wherever i can
209262 american idol is family entertainment it is not programming primarily directed at children under 12

209267 to me its very much like losing chris daughtry or tamyra gray from american idol
209268 either one of them leaving will or twitch was a big disappointment i really thought will twitch and joshua would be fighting it out until the end
209269 its all part of my strategic plan to take over tv diddy tv
209270 but the show isnt about just seeing if i could find someone to work for me its about people chasing their dreams
209271 i dont say it in a cocky way but i take pride in being one of the best at doing what i do
209272 to show them that they can do more things than shoot basketball or rap
209273 to get to me is like getting to the wizard of oz they had to prove themselves they had to walk down the yellow brick road
209274 my show has a whole different style and a whole different energy
209275 but if the apprentice helped to open up the door for this show then so be it
209276 the approval today of india specific safeguards agreement by the international atomic energy agency iaea board of governors is a key step towards implementation of the us india civil nuclear cooperation initiative we will work vigorously with india to obtain an india specific exception in the nuclear suppliers group and the final us congressional approval
209277 the world has to adapt to the high price of carbon based fuels
209278 national treasury must come to the assistance of the citizens by this time you should be engaging in how can you alleviate this problem whilst you interact with the sector departments
209279 it seems there is no integrated approach among government in general you say that high food prices are an incentive for us to improve agriculture but the fact of the matter is that farmers are going for game farming highly productive farms are now turned into game farms
209280 the fact of the matter is the way government coordinates its activity becomes a problem the challenge is here and we must be sure that that integrated approach is put into effect
209281 small farmers these new black farmers are struggling because they dont have water rights those are with established farmers
209282 he confessed he cut her up and even photographed the body on his cellular phone
209283 i thought i was so fat i was 130 pounds
209284 no social order could sustain itself over the long run primarily on a foundation of organized state power on the contrary the inclination of a ruling class to rely upon repression and violence was a sign of weakness rather than strength what contributed to real political durability was the scope of popular support or ideological consent
209285 encompassed the whole range of values attitudes beliefs cultural norms legal precepts etc that to one degree or another permeated civil society that solidified the class structure and the multiple forms of domination that pass through it
209286 so che ne ho diritto ma non mi avvarr di alcun avvocato di ufficio
209287 non credo che lei conosca i dettagli del mio arresto e le irregolarit commesse
209288 se lei vuole sollevare eventuali errori procedurali deve presentarli alla camera che poi li esaminer e decider se ammetterli o meno
209289 non mi sono stati letti i miei diritti non ho potuto mandare sms ai miei amici
209290 lei avr in futuro tutte le opportunit di spiegare le sue motivazioni
209291 di vita o di morte temo per la mia vita
209292 were putting that technology in place to enable us to do that
209293 everybody has a camera in their telephones when people can record an event taking place that helps us during an investigation its helpful
209294 the rub among the adults is is this good taste
209295 given more of a traditional background one would have to say no but then it doesnt matter anymore
209296 kids are exposed at younger and younger ages to more and more sexually graphic material
209297 when you show an ad that showcases shortcuts to those things youre not just selling underwear or t shirts youre selling whole ways of being
209298 you show an ad of a girl looking like shes just had sex or about to have sex in rumpled sheets wearing a certain type of underwear that creates a model of whats ok for a kid
209299 greatest shortcut to a 60 second ad or a one impression ad
209300 id just say to the creators of these ads put your 12 year old girl or boy in front of them and see if you repeat them
209301 its pretty easy to get attention but its not that easy to get some relevance it really takes some poetry
209302 hes very political the exposure has been remarkable and hes kind of sexually oriented
209303 theyve created a really consistent campaign that you can sort of see from a mile away
209304 you always know when youre looking at an american apparel ad aside from the kind of homage to pornography thats going on
209305 the market segment to which his ads appeal has lost all sense
209306 all morality all the good taste all the propriety is gone
209307 i dont think we can really blame dov hes an opportunist
209308 whats one to do when they see an ad for american apparel who would make lolita look like she could apply for social security
209309 definitely in london and in the uk the standards are more lenient and sort of risky advertising is expected i think you wouldnt see something like that from bmw in the u s
209310 a lot of times the controversy at work is kind of needed to cut through all the noise thats out there and get people to pay attention to the brand
209311 i think the biggest concern from my perspective isnt necessarily the products its more the lifestyle
209312 we wanted to create a provocative unconventional campaign that resonates with gossip girls sophisticated media savvy young adult fans
209313 by utilizing creative statements made by third party sources and outlets this new campaign speaks directly to our target audience in a way they will appreciate
209314 the models look very young and they probably are not but its just normalizing what is acceptable behavior
209315 were all creatures of our culture and in his way elvis was as shocking to a generation of parents as these ads have been to another one
209316 have we been progressing down the food chain of hyper sexuality anyone whos seen a bratz doll can say the answer
209317 there have been really big brands that have kind of done the kind of faux porno approach in the past and brands for decades kind of flirted with different ways of draping sexuality over their products
209318 the commercials looked like they were shot in a basement with a handheld camcorder and there was a voice that might as well have been a pedophile
209319 i remember kind of getting a sick feeling watching them
209320 im not seeing the backlash and that might be out there but kind of interesting me is by going the viral route youre just going directly to the consumers without striking up any kind of reaction from the parent
209321 its probably pretty safe if youre willing to go out on a limb and do something like what bmw did or what american apparel does
209322 we must not rule out military force against long standing adversaries such as iran and syria
209323 at moment of great peril in the past century our leaders ensured that america by deed and by example led and lifted the world that we stood and fought for the freedom sought by billions of people beyond their borders
209324 if i could give her satisfaction to the highest thats what gave me satisfaction
209325 il dialogo con lopposizione sarebbe auspicabile ma da parte dellopposizione non si vedono segnali di reale volont a collaborare con la maggioranza
209326 sarebbe auspicabile tuttavia non vedo segnali che mi facciano sperare in questa direzione per ora lopposizione dopo avere tanto detto e ridetto sulla volont di dialogo ha tenuto comportamenti di ostruzione in parlamento per non parlare delle dichiarazioni e di quello che si legge sui giornali credo manchi il minimo rispetto dellaltra parte il rispetto nei nostri confronti e un comportamento reale per lavorare insieme noi assicura per il cavaliere andremo avanti per mantenere i nostri impegni elettorali con le nostre forze se lopposizione si aggregher come auspica anche il capo dello stato saremo felici ma non credo che questo possa succedere
209327 the simplicity of this process is amazing using common and affordable elements and a glass of water these chemists may have given us a future way to efficiently obtain oxygen by splitting water
209328 it was a party so its not like we went that deep
209329 but i think we talked about casper my french bulldog and how much we both think the butterfly stroke sucks
209330 i guess i was probably reading too much into his clothes but i just assumed that he would be into certain things like maybe he would like whit stillman and the dirty projectors or at the very least wes anderson and vampire weekend
209331 i should have listened to my gut instincts then and there and realized that was a red flag who like gets my number calls me and asks me on a date is this mad men but i guess i was kinda flattered so i said yes
209332 i knew the burgers there werent organic or anything but i didnt want to be that person on a first date so i didnt say anything
209333 at first i thought clay was wearing khakis i thought there was no way that would be possible but as he got closer and closer i realized he was definitely wearing khakis khakis with pleats and one of those polo shirts with the giant logo the size of your hand
209334 i told myself that maybe he was making some kind of weird meta statement about how much first dates resemble job interviews so i just kissed his cheek and we went inside

209342 ever so briefly an application was available at the iphone apps store that used the iphone to bridge an internet connection and a computer in other words a tethering app it cost 10 and was offered by nullriver
209343 netshare used a socks5 proxy to allow the computer to connect to the iphones wi fi radio excited users pounced and began downloading the application even though apple had to have approved that application at some point it caught wind of what the app could really do and yanked it from the store
209344 were not quite sure why apple took down the application yet weve received no communication from apple thus far netshare did not violate any of the developer or appstore agreements were hoping well get some feedback from apple tomorrow sorry to all the folks that couldnt get it in time well do our best to try to get the application back onto the appstore if at all possible at the very least i would hope apple will allow it in countries where the provider does permit tethering

209364 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic the way they acted was extraordinary
209365 they were very brave they reacted swiftly calmly in exiting the bus and as a result nobody else was injured
209366 stop the bus somebodys getting stabbed everyone get the hell off
209367 they returned to the back of the bus to find that the person who was stabbing the person in the neck had now sawed off the head of the victim
209368 he cut the victims head off and then walked up to the door holding it and just looked at them crazy like and then dropped the head and walked back to the body and started cutting it some more
209369 we have word from people on the scene that when the killer was alone with the body that there may have been some small acts of cannibalism on the body

209456 my job is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable
209457 if this is my last games which im planning on it being ill have memories i believe were good and some that were more difficult than i would have wished
209458 in sydney it was a real roller coaster ride i prepared very very well and my then girlfriends robinsons now wife sarah father was killed in a road accident 2 weeks before the olympics
209459 our families were very close so it gave me a a bump and roll and i didnt quite get back up from it
209460 i ended up going into the games quite ill and didnt perform at all getting knocked out in the semi final
209461 i went home and that was the olympic games period that made me realise what life was all about
209462 after quite a few months off i realised paddling was still in my heart and the ambition to get up each day and want to race was there so thats why i came back
209463 i got a learning curve on whats really important to me and what i really wanted to do
209464 i did the fastest time that ive ever paddled in a 1000m single at the trials this year so ive definitely improved theres no doubt about that
209465 mentally i look at things very differently and certainly at the olympic games i look at things very very differently
209466 i try to not take too much to heart these days and put all my trust and concentration into the performance i think im a little wiser hopefully i will be as tough as i was when i was young
209467 im in a very different position being the leader of our k4 crew and the mens pair as well so this games i have a lot more responsibility on my shoulders to try and get the best result for the guys as well
209468 the sheer weight of numbers 1986 being the last win is an indicator of what it takes
209469 obviously what we brought in the past hasnt been enough and were conscious of that but really keen about that as well these guys love that sort of challenge
209470 it is not an issue we manage and monitor our weeks according to our state and i think these guys are in better shape for this challenge than they would have been in week one or week two
209471 they have got a challenge it is very clear how significant this challenge is it is obvious for all to see but theyre excited they are standing at the foot of the hill and theyre ready to climb they are waiting for the whistle
209472 i was really excited about the first one it was good to get that one behind us it was a real grind i suspect this weekend could be that again it could be ugly but it will be intense and there will be drama
209473 because for a lot of years cronulla was a team that nobody feared nobody really worried about
209474 but now we want to get that dominance back and it starts at home in our local area against a club that has effectively been around for 100 years
209475 i mean i dont think we have a particular dominance over anyone yet were no ones bogy team but if we can be well we want to start with the dragons
209476 sticky often talks about how you can own a team and thats what we were fighting to do to own the dragons
209477 thats why i reckon this game against st george illawarra is going to be massive the biggest game weve played all season
209478 i mean all the older players here like paul gallen and danny nutley theyre always saying how much they want to beat the dragons how much the dragons want to beat us
209479 our players who come from outside the area are always having the rivalry drummed into them too
209480 i think the dragons real strength is in their forwards
209481 jason ryles is in the best form of his career justin poore has been outstanding even some of the lesser known guys like dan hunt and lagi setu are firing
209482 and then you get a guy like dean young coming back in at hooker he really toughens their pack up so they were a grinding side and we expect them to play this one the same way its going to be a real battle
209483 so him and my dad chris theyve been mates for quite a while
209484 and coming from a small town well i guess everyone knows everyone else anyway so brownie organised a trial for me and i was eventually picked in sg ball i went to endeavour high while i was playing but because the season was so short i eventually went back home to finish year 12
209485 well it wasnt that the dragons didnt show any interest but no one really contacted me or anything and the sharks did they said come up and have a run with us and ive been in the shire ever since
209486 but i do owe brownie a lot hes the reason i came to sydney
209487 we were told yesterday that the yellow cards in this competition carry over weve got six guys sitting on cards
209488 should any of those pick up another one then weve got a problem
209489 and if the lot of them pick up another one then weve got a real problem because we wont have a team
209490 well have to forfeit the first game against melbourne if we dont make the final of the cup
209491 weve had meetings with them referees and a lot of things become in their opinion i think when its trial and error you are going to find theres going to be cards dished out
209492 at the end of the day well try and be sensible tomorrow night but its a game we want to win and football is competitive
209493 at times things happen where you might end up picking up yellow cards and we are going to pay a price for it
209494 if you be realistic its a pre season cup thats been watered down compared to what it has been in recent years
209495 for this to carry over could be a bad start to the season for all the teams because i think everyone has got a few people on yellows
209496 mate the ford blokes reckon we need to work harder
209497 there is no doubt mark is having a great run but we were having a great run around this time last year we know that he is going really well so it is up to us to catch him
209498 we holden performance racing test here so we have a fairly good indication of what is required
209499 we started the weekend with a package we know really well but we will have to see what it does on the new tyre we got some work done today and we know where we need to go i am pretty confident we can improve the car to where we want it
209500 we were up there for most of the day and just got out lapped on the greens we were there all session but we just ran out of time we are there and thereabouts and what tomorrow brings no one knows
209501 there is a dry line and a wet line if you stay on that dry line for a lap you will get a good time if you put it a foot over the line you will be spinning
209502 there was a bit of tip toeing around in the wet but moving further up the grid is what we want to do
209503 ive never felt this fit in my life i dont feel 42 i feel 25
209504 im doing more training now than i ever have i know they say theres degradation over time
209505 but i havent really noticed they say youre supposed to lose x amount a year but i reckon the people theyre measuring the samples theyre looking at arent able to train the way i have
209506 maybe their motivation isnt there but i do seriously feel as i felt when i was 25
209507 im absolutely lucky yes im blessed i got unbelievable genes from my parents im co ordinated the willingness or the want to do things really well has meant that i can do things very efficiently i have three gorgeous girls a gorgeous wife a comfortable existence
209508 ive played footy on the mcg for afl side melbourne clean bowled an australian batsman justin langer in an exhibition game everything works life works
209509 it was not about what he said or did it was intangible invisible but i could feel this amazing force or influence he had he could perform under pressure and do it in a way that appeared magical it was extraordinary
209510 id seen this movie about a scottish hammer thrower and just as he was about to throw he thought of his bonny lass calling to him so during that final in barcelona i thought of bridget could see her
209511 we should do this for the rest of our lives
209512 when i saw her throw a tennis ball like a bloke i thought shes the one
209513 it would be too easy to do that i would be letting myself down i like to do things as well as possible if im playing tennis i want to play like roger federer
209514 i seem to be able to teach myself quite well i can look at something and notice how it works and then practise it its muscle memory a bit anyway same as rowing lucky huh
209515 this totally self absorbed life where everything and everyone around you is focused on allowing you to do what you are there to do wow very few people get the luxury of being able to do that
209516 im enjoying hanging on to this last phase extracting every moment out of it to have the wife and kids there to support me doing it so i can totally focus on doing what i have to do its remarkable i have an employer bt australia who supports me its an incredibly self absorbed luxury
209517 ill go stir crazy for a bit definitely ill need a challenge of some description
209518 the thing is the way im feeling now i reckon i could go on and if i think i could theres a massive temptation to try
209519 all the guys are probably sleeping now but i dont want to miss out on anything that sums up my life i guess i dont want to miss out
209520 thats the one area wed like to be better wed like them to be going the other way but its soft everywhere
209521 we are in for the long haul sydney ratings are down but the ratings for non sydney swans games telecast in sydney are down more

209524 we have never said it is easy in this market
209525 its the most competitive football market in the world and the job is still ahead of us
209526 my job is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable
209527 people think that perhaps spending at least 65 percent in the classroom is a good thing and it is
209528 the point is were spending more than 65 percent in the classroom already what we need to be doing is continuing to up the resources and not simply cut the pie differently
209529 if you cant get 65 percent give us the reasons why

209556 when the war in iraq started i went into a depression state i feltconstantly worried and agitated and it was hard to enjoy doing things iloved to do then i found your site it lifted my spirits and helped get me out ofthe funk i was in now im going to school and enjoying the things ilike to do whenever i feel depressed i visit your site
209557 when i get to work in the morning iget my coffee jump online and read the news every day i went home sadand depressed then i found your site and after reading the first storyi immediately felt my spirits lift i never went home sad again reading ordinary news gives us a sense that thats all there is butyour site reminds us that there is more and the world is not as bad asthe news would lead us to believe thank you for everything
209558 there really werent many opportunities for people to redeem themselves we wanted to see success stories but we faced overcrowded courtrooms budget crisis staff shortages as well as skepticism from judges and attorneys to give persons charged with crimes a second chance
209559 someone needed to inspire a change to wake the system up and really focus on developing alternatives for the court system
209560 the success of one of my clients has the effect of giving the next client more consideration for an alternative program by the court and prosecutor this is something i try to emphasize to each client that someone else in the future may get that second chance based on their success in this program
209561 in these uncertain times people are looking for tools and experiences that empower them to deal with life more effectively
209562 avatar combines proven processes and personal coaching from trained teachers to guide people safely through transformative experiences what people experience are real insights were thrilled that more people than ever are seeing the value of this work
209563 one of the reasons for the increasing success of the avatar course is that it is respectful of all belief systems
209564 people around the world are looking for ways to create a better world avatar gives them tools for making a better world by making themselves better people
209565 i have several lengthy online lectures for class and textaloud works really well to help me watch my kids and listen to the lectures instead of tiring out my eyes from being glued to a screen
209566 id tried some text to speech about nine years ago but was turned off by the funny sounding cartoonish voices
209567 in this area textaloud easily saves me one to two hours a day
209568 i would definitely recommend textaloud for anyone who gets fatigue symptoms from computer time
209569 textaloud also helps me proofread my own work it especially helps when my eyes are tired but my ear readily picks up grammatical errors i would otherwise miss and sometimes helps me hear where i could reword my thoughts better too
209570 i can listen to e mails fold laundry and make sure my toddler and baby are not eating cat food or thinking that the kitty litter is a new sandbox
209571 the kids will type in funny things for the software to say and everyone laughs its been fun introducing them to this kind of technology and it gets them interested in their typing skills too
209572 i like being able to change it around to keep it from being monotonous
209573 also in those times when i feel sleepy but know i should get some reading in a higher pitched voice keeps me more alert
209574 im more productive at school and more relaxed in my home
209575 but i really knew text to speech was a valid means of communication when i found myself practically rolling on the floor laughing while listening to some entertaining anecdotal reading read aloud by the software textaloud is excellent

209577 to build a strong and solid path for women to realize their dreams facilitate actions in making them happen and having the necessary tools to do so
209578 this is about lighting a fire in women who want more out of their lives
209579 i want all women to rise above their perceived limitations and reclaim their power the purpose of my book is to show women that they too can take back control of their lives beginning right now
209580 burning tree will benefit greatly from the skills and abilities of an industry leader like mark
209581 for the past year we have been restructuring streamlining and improving corporate operations to better serve our clients under the leadership of acting ceo and chief operating officer curt maddon with mark and curt now leading the wealth of talent at burning tree theres no limit to what we will accomplish
209582 i am very excited and honored to be at the helm of burning tree programs their clinical mission and integrity are very substantial and of the highest quality standards in the industry today we have an outstanding multidisciplinary staff and management team that will continue to provide excellent addiction dual disorder rehabilitation services for clients and their families in the national and local regions we serve
209583 to work with a person of marks caliber is a once in a lifetime opportunity i am excited at the possibilities this presents for both burning tree and myself i am absolutely certain he will take us to the next level and beyond
209584 i created this course because i found methods and techniques that work in overcoming all forms of anxiety and panic disorder and i wanted to share what id discovered with everyone else whos affected by these conditions i started out by teaching these methods via my free newsletter and that worked great but i knew if i wanted to reach a wider audience i had to do something extra special so i created my free online course
209585 alex really is a genius after going through the first few steps my panic attacks were a lot easier to overcome and now after part 4 i really do think i can completely overcome this
209586 im so thankful to alex ive been following all the advice in his course and its helped tremendously
209587 im so happy to hear the positive results experienced by the people whove already gone through the course
209588 and now that the final version of the course has gone live im thrilled at the prospect of these ideas reaching many more people who are facing the same challenges i was a few years ago
209589 its natural to attribute healing to a doctor or a miracle drug
209590 but the lesson from hezekiah is that if you pray to god for healing and ask others to pray for you as well then god should receive the credit the healed by god pendant isnt just for practicing jews and christians its for everyone who is willing to acknowledge that theyve been healed through the power of prayer
209591 hopefully its the missing link to push us into the championship top two weve got a tough division and we want to give it our best shot
209592 its an awful lot of money but it shows how far weve come
209593 its an investment in the quality of football at bristol city and thats the key really

209623 theres also a certain wage that some people are holding out for like a gun to our head at this minute in time and that we could just not realistically afford
209624 we realise that there are one or two players that we are going to have to push the boat out for as far as transfer money and wages are concerned

209633 it has been creeping down the hill torching some of the trees in the area
209634 quite a ways up the canyon where the road dead ends

209637 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months

209640 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress
209641 i have not yet talked with anyone at the white house and dont expect that this matter will be finally resolved in the very near future
209642 harriet miers is not immune from compelled congressional process she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena
209643 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
209644 if the administration appeals the ruling our congressional prerogatives will once again be put at risk
209645 we look forward to the white house complying with this ruling and to scheduling future hearings with ms miers and other witnesses who have relied on such claims
209646 we hope that the defendants will accept this decision and expect that we will receive relevant documents and call ms miers to testify in september
209647 i look forward to working with the white house and the justice department to coordinate the long overdue appearances
209648 im sure it will be appealed and it will go on into next year and it will become a moot issue

209655 this pivotal study in men with prostate cancer demonstrated once again that denosumab increases bmd consistently at all sites measured we are also excited by the reduction in vertebral fractures which permits the conclusion that the increased bmd seen in patients receiving denosumab is associated with improved bone strength

209672 using il 8 as a biomarker to screen low risk septic shock patients from clinical trials of experimental or potentially high risk therapies is an effective strategy to improve the risk to benefit ratio of a given intervention
209673 excluding patients who respond to standard care would enable investigators to focus clinical trial enrollment on patients least likely to respond well to conventional methods and find the most effective new therapies
209674 this is the first study to demonstrate an independent association between all cause mortality and sleep apnea in a community based study
209675 the size of the increased mortality risk was surprisingly large in our particular study a six fold increase means that having significant sleep apnea at age 40 gives you about the same mortality risk as somebody aged 57 who doesnt have sleep apnea
209676 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
209677 people who have or suspect that they have sleep apnea should consult their physicians about diagnosis and treatment options
209678 the main driving idea is to frame the discussion of leadership equity accountability and partnerships around concrete actionable goals
209679 its time to set specific goals and hold everyone accountable for reaching them
209680 is that beyond rhetoric and philosophical debates the aim of all contributions is to suggest practical ways to move forward in some cases through explicit recommendations in others through directions for shaping or reshaping the environments in which the spread of hiv can be curbed and access to quality care and treatment can be made available to all who need it
209681 it is increasingly clear that despite laudable advances in hiv technologies and outcomes true success is still evasive continually being thwarted by age old issues such as stigma discrimination poverty and lack of accountability
209682 new paradigms are needed for understanding and responding to the aids pandemic and this journal is a timely and constructive source of information for those efforts
209683 the smallest pore size is the key to the strength of porous materials and what they can do
209684 seeing inside bulk porous materials has never been done before at this resolution making this one of the first applications of x ray diffractive microscopy to a real problem
209685 the strength and stiffness of foam like structures are expected to scale with their density relating the density of individual elements like beams and nodes to the overall density
209686 but below about 10 percent density the strength of aerogels like the ones we tested on the order of 1 percent density is orders of magnitude less than expected
209687 the high resolution we achieved allowed us to see which of these models more accurately described the actual observed structure
209688 the structure was far more complex than anything wed seen in earlier images obtained using this technique
209689 wed like to use x ray diffraction to study a range of porous materials and nanostructures in general for example porous polymers developed at the molecular foundry for storing hydrogen as fuel and at even higher resolutions
209690 to do so david shapiro who built the end station we used for this work is working with us to overcome some obstacles
209691 and after all this you can find out the sample was no good so you have to start over
209692 we are also collaborating with berkeley labs computational research division to develop efficient and robust algorithms to speed up the time needed to construct the 3 d image from the individual rotated views
209693 this will open an entire spectrum of possibilities for new ways of seeing the very small not just aerogels but virtually any unknown object from nanostructures to biological cells
209694 undeniably low maternal vitamin d affects the way the brain develops
209695 over the past four years weve been able to show that low vitamin d intake in animals during pregnancy results in offspring with brain abnormalities similar to those seen in patients with schizophrenia
209696 the danes are only able to give us 1 6 microlitres of plasma so weve had to come up with a method of determining the vitamin d levels in that tiny amount of blood
209697 in collaboration with alun jones at the institute of molecular bioscience weve developed a way to easily measure low levels of vitamin d using mass spectrometry
209698 if we establish the link in this huge patient cohort we will be able to show that having low maternal vitamin d does not necessarily mean a child is going to develop schizophrenia but if a child has a particularly vulnerable genome the low maternal vitamin d may be the environmental trigger
209699 its the combination of gene and environment which triggers the disease
209700 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
209701 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy
209702 turning cb1 back on and then treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention
209703 people have looked at cannabinoids in cancer earlier mainly in cell culture experiments
209704 the molecular mechanisms for loss of the receptor and its effect on cancer have not been previously shown
209705 just increasing the levels of cannabinoids to treat colorectal cancer wont work if the cb1 receptor is not present
209706 it appears that higher quality articles in other words more citable articles are simply made freely available
209707 previous studies using different methods simply got cause and effect reversed
209708 the established dogma is that freely available scientific articles are cited more because they are read more
209709 we found that open access publishing may reach more readers than subscription access publishing but there is no evidence that freely accessible articles are cited any more than subscription access articles
209710 there were definitely more article downloads for freely accessible articles
209711 yet nearly half of these downloads were by internet indexing robots like google crawling the web for free content
209712 there are many reasons to provide free access to the literature
209713 women whose husbands work long hours are more likely to quit their jobs yet mens careers are not impacted when their wives put in long hours
209714 this suggests a potential return to the separate spheres arrangement breadwinning men and homemaking women as long hours become increasingly common

209721 were seeing a definite shift in compensation given the downward trend from last year and this year
209722 were seeing the culmination of it now its finally coming to a head
209723 stock used to be given out in 1 000 or 100 000 share increments now they set a monetary limit on it say the value of 60 000 worth of shares
209724 the key is to make sure you motivate executives to accomplish the tasks you want them to do without shareholders thinking the compensation is out of line with the marketplace
209725 even before the slow economy companies started focusing on issues of morale
209726 theyre evolving toward performance based pay for executives base salary has become only a percentage of fair market value
209727 healthy organizations get creative with executive compensation and if executives reach performance objectives
209728 they can earn well over 100 percent of fair market value

209731 there is absolutely no point in negotiating a deal that is not acceptable to the people with money
209732 the mdc knows that any agreement must be acceptable to britain the us and other western countries which want mugabe to go
209733 we may profit by their experience without paying the price which it cost them
209734 and while taking the opportunity to help the victims amai mugabe became one of the first national political leaders to condemn violence
209735 amai mugabe took the message of peace to the people of zimbabwe stressing the need for unity against the common enemy
209736 amai mugabe like a true mother figure gently chided the nation and reminded zimbabweans that this was their country

209766 we have evidence to suggest cr uptake into muscles in copd patients but are unable to explain why an increase in muscle cr did not enhance training
209767 the most likely explanation is that any benefits of creatine have been submerged by the large training effect of physical training alone
209768 those of us interested in pulmonary rehabilitation are happy to see confirmation of the beneficial effects of exercise training this information indicates that creatine supplementation not be viewed as a good substitute for exercise training good news for adepts of pulmonary rehabilitation
209769 without minimizing the importance of the quest to optimize the results of pulmonary rehabilitation we had to appreciate that only a small portion of patients with copd actually engage in pulmonary rehabilitation so improved access is important for pr to achieve its full potential from a public health perspective
209770 these and other studies are finally gaining recognition that pulmonary rehabilitation is an essential element of comprehensive care for patients with copd
209771 in countries with low prevalence of initial multi drug resistance the standardized treatment regimens for new case appear to be adequate wrote dick menzies m
209772 however in countries where the prevalence of initial drug resistance exceeds three percent we believe it is urgent to strengthen capacity to perform drug sensitivity testing or to reevaluate these standard treatment regimens given the unacceptably high rates of failure and relapse
209773 we hypothesized that in countries using standardized initial and retreatment regimens the proportion of patients with poor treatment outcomes would be correlated with prevalence of initial and acquired multi drug resistance
209774 this is striking evidence that mdr tb is directly linked to the increased failure rates of our current treatment regimens
209775 in the short term the higher the failure and relapse rates mean greater morbidity and mortality for patients with greater social and economic harm for their families and communities in the long term these standardized regimens may be contributing to amplification of multi drug resistance in these countries
209776 unless those with the responsibility to boost control and research efforts increase their commitments and their financial investments by several fold we may never see elimination of this major scourge in the decades to come

209800 this study provides substantial evidence that these programmes can be rolled out effectively across a large number of local authorities there is now considerable evidence to suggest that such programmes do have benefits in improving antisocial behaviour in children and the psychological and social functioning of parents
209801 all local authorities were aware of this as a problem and related it to the timing of the courses parent being seen to mean mother and a lack of men running the classes
