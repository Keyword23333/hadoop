8620033 to maintain a leadership position globally the united states needs high value added products and services to be the engine of its economy
8620034 one way to do that is through science and technology but we need to know how to get those discoveries into the economy
8620035 since the investment and r amp d decisions you make today are often not easily quantifiable and not coming to fruition for fifteen to twenty years special intuition and judgment are required
8620036 compared with operations marketing and strategy we dont really know as much about how to manage research or value it especially when it has long time horizons for science based companies more collaboration and openness both within and outside the organization are probably required of them than theyre used to different kinds of partnerships and new licensing and intellectual property arrangements are also necessary
8620037 we tried to highlight some of the unusual fresh thinking such as ibms radical collaboration model in semiconductor r amp d that business leaders are using to approach the challenges associated with science based businesses
8620038 i see a lot of great research going on within hbs
8620039 im struck by the opportunities we have to develop more interaction with the business community through colloquia like this and through executive education programs i think its critically important for hbs and for the country to grow leaders who are fluent in the language of technology and knowledgeable about the challenges facing leaders in those businesses
8620040 whether its the whitesides one lab model with dozens of post docs from diverse fields collaboratively working on big problems or the stem cell institutes embrace of multiple labs and hundreds of scientists or the broads model of a small group of leaders catalyzing a networked community of scientists that focus on big problems we know that each of these different institutions is innovative and successful and we want to better understand their best practices
8620041 the competitive advantage of the u s economy lies in our great science institutions and university infrastructure
8620042 we need to learn better how to exploit that advantage and how to grow new businesses out of it once worlds apart and unto themselves businesses have become involved in the pursuit of science and universities in the commercialization of science unlike traditional high technology science based businesses especially biotech and pharmaceuticals nanotechnology and materials science are not just users of advanced science they are direct participants in the creation of science they straddle two worlds with very different expectations time horizons risks and norms new management skills new organizational forms new institutional and financial arrangements and a new breed of leadership are all essential
8620043 the science economy creating leaders for a new breed of business
8620044 at hbs we should be the ones trying to figure these things out and teaching them to the next generation

8620111 we have been able to effectively manage our costs while seizing revenue opportunities and investing for future growth
8620112 our record revenue and solid performance through difficult market conditions demonstrate the strength of our diversified businesses i am confident we have the right strategies and disciplines in place for long term success
8620113 even with the reduction in fuel prices over the last few weeks competitive pressure on fares and volumes will continue and we are at best expected to break even in the second half delivering a loss for the full year
8620114 it is now clear that we will require further fundamental changes in our operating cost base in order to minimise losses in 2009 and to help ensure the long term viability of the business
8620115 the seasonally weaker first half has been marked by extremely difficult market conditions in the form of unprecedented fuel costs slowing economic growth in our main markets and a weakness in dollar and sterling
8620116 fuel is the most significant cost within the business and the 56 5 million euro increase in our first half fuel costs contributed significantly to a loss
8620117 the losses were looking at in 2009 could be substantial
8620118 is so strong that it could sustain losses for several years to come
8620119 because the database offers highly pedigreed information users can count on what they find there its peer reviewed and they can have a high degree of certainty of it being reliable
8620120 bio response data for that material would be sent to our mpmd product developer at materials park
8620121 the information provided would be edited and peer reviewed prior to its release by our editors and the contributors name would be added to an authors table in the database
8620122 this kind of visibility is a tremendous asset in becoming better known in the medical devices community
8620123 being published in the database will be a worthy addition for established professionals and will also be valuable for younger professionals who are looking to build their list of authored papers
8620124 we are reaching out to people who have spent a lifetime studying or working exclusively in a particular area
8620125 these individuals have a wealth of knowledge that the database and the entire medical devices community can benefit from
8620126 when detailed data is entered into the database it can significantly improve the usability of the database for the end user and potentially significantly reduce the time they will need to dedicate to performing their own research

8620430 supplies have been checked government buildings on all three islands have been shuttered and the government hospitals including faith hospital are ready

8620434 were hearing reports of how persons have prepared themselves for gustav and also how they are assisting one another including our elderly single mothers with children and persons who may have difficulties getting ready
8620435 but im seeing a level of preparedness here that supports all i was told about cayman before i arrived here it also bears what ive seen for myself over the past two years the people of cayman know how to prepare and they look after each other
8620436 advisories from the national hurricane centre in miami and information on the internet can be helpful but they are not written from the particular caymanian context and perspective
8620437 so its important to distinguish these from local advisories issued by hmcis joint communications service or jcs
8620438 among other information these jcs advisories provide storm proximity to the cayman islands the estimated time for weather conditions to begin to affect us and tell the public when to expect the next local update
8620439 and gustav is no different predictions are made on the best information available but they are just that predictions they can change in a matter of hours

8620524 there have been bands on in the park in previous years normally traditional brass bands
8620525 this year they wanted to do something a bit different
8620526 the reason i hadnt confirmed dates in australia is i really didnt know what i was getting into
8620527 but now i know i have a show that breathes and changes and is dependent on peoples moods and environment i cant wait to bring it home
8620528 the scale of this tour is enormous but the space is really liberating for me thats what we wanted to do give me some more freedom its hard to explain but im in a different mindset parts of the show are so over the top like those freddie moments in your disco needs you why not have fun
8620529 i dont even know if a lot of people in the audience even know that song i have to assume a lot of people come without having heard the rest of the album
8620530 in retrospect we could definitely have bettered it ill say that straight up
8620531 given the time we had it is what it is i had a lot of fun doing it im excited about bringing those songs to life on stage wow in my arms and 2 hearts are crackers they go off like a frog in a sock
8620532 the internet and forums in particular well its not like youre face to face with people in a room and everyone raises their hands and says something so i take a lot of that with a grain of salt
8620533 people want to say something and contradict each other to start conversations thats good but i have to stick to what im doing
8620534 i certainly dont do everything on this tour the way i might have imagined it but thats creativity and i love it for all of its ups and downs
8620535 the setlist of the show now is pretty much as it was meant to be a b c d e f g didnt work so we had to change whole sections it didnt flow the way it was meant to amidst all that i was staying pretty calm at least one on hand i can honestly say weve changed something every night whether its hair or make up or putting a song in thats what i mean about freedom in this tour it keeps everyone fresh and on their toes
8620536 all the changes have been fantastic really refreshing with that group i feel like we could go off piste and do a gig anywhere theyre all so enthusiastic
8620537 no it wasnt to be honest not at all i didnt know what the show was going to be the last thing i wanted was to book an australian tour a year out
8620538 i couldnt actually say last september ill do a tour all year long
8620539 i had to do it in increments thats really worked its been broken up into phases well have our break and then everyone will be excited to see each other again its a really good vibe relaxed but really on it
8620540 i was sincere in saying to everyone i cant believe weve come this far its been amazing and challenging and with a really difficult start it was all about getting to london and here we are theres parts in the show where its emotional but thats the point of doing a show all those different forms of emotion
8620541 i always go over there with the same attitude ive always had which is if its to happen itll happen
8620542 im kept pretty much busy enough well see im not racing over there im heading home
8620543 thats not who i am i dont like doing stuff like that but thats a fact of life that happens and it happens frequently one cant point the finger of blame in any particular direction but i feel better for having shared that its a tricky one its not to scare people and i know its a cliche but if one person thinks i might see someone else i just dont feel right then good
8620544 that was a very cosmopolitan afternoon when theres a day off we organise something thats do able for everyone that was the first time id been to the movies in ages

8620612 it may not sound like a lot but we are a community based not for profit club so that amount of money represents a considerable loss for us and we have had to devote a lot of staff time to clean up as well

8620617 but cap and trade energy restrictions will certainly be back in the 111th congress should they pass the government will be in the position of rationing energy through a complicated system of carbon allowances creating not a free market for carbon but an artificial market where politicians decide which industries live or die as revenues and carbon permits from a cap and trade program would be doled out as environmental pork

8620623 men who have been posted to a covering force are often doomed to certain death this is because they will remain at their posts even when they are overwhelmingly outnumbered on account of their dread of the punishment that awaits them
8620624 those who have lost a shield or a sword or any weapon on the battlefield often hurl themselves upon the enemy hoping that they will either recover the weapon they have lost or else escape by death from the inevitable disgrace and the humiliations they would suffer at home

8620712 while us secretary of state condoleezza rice has been pressuring israel to stop the expansion of israeli settlements on palestinian land

8620750 while organic growth remains strong in food ingredients usa and nutritionals the performance of food ingredients ireland in the second half will be reduced relative to the second half of 2007 as global dairy market volatility has created a time lag in balancing input costs and market returns
8620751 global dairy markets went to a spike in pricing in 2007 have come off that and come back to more normalised pricing which is still above the average of previous periods

8620761 the richness of our site pages presented a considerable challenge for effective content acceleration especially as we are growing so quickly
8620762 we needed to offload the content to a content delivery network that could not only improve our performance but also enable nearly unlimited growth
8620763 mashable has rapidly become the go to site for social media news from around the world and quickly established a leadership position in the social media sphere
8620764 that position of popularity has put pressure on their infrastructure and were pleased they decided to turn to us to alleviate that pressure and ensure their site content is reliably delivered
8620765 while we are capable of meeting current demand there is a backlog of high priority patients and in that context the decision to outsource to an australian hospital with the capacity to perform that surgery within the next three months makes sense

8620768 two thirds of adverse events after a heart attack which may be a further heart attack stroke or major bleed happen after a patient has been discharged from hospital

8620770 while we have shown that the new probe can work for two types of procedures we believe that results will be more far reaching
8620771 there are many catheter based interventional procedures where 3 d ultrasound guidance could be used including heart valve replacements and placement of coils in the brain to prevent stroke wherever a catheter can go the probe can go
8620772 while the images obtained this way are good some patients experience adverse reactions to the contrast agent
8620773 also the images gained this way are fleeting the 3 d ultrasound guidance does not use x ray radiation or contrast agents and the images are real time and continuous
8620774 these tiny transducers work together to create one large transducer working much like the compound eyes of insects
8620775 i believe we have shown that 3 d ultrasound clearly works in a wide variety of interventional procedures
8620776 we envision a time in the not too distant future when this technology becomes standard equipment in various catheter kits

8620866 kristin had a good start to her senior season versus mercer
8620867 she has been kept out of our starting lineup and games over the past two seasons because of injuries so it was encouraging to see her start play well and log some good minutes she has the potential to be a major contributor this year

8620878 to actually secure the deal and bring shaun back home is a fantastic coup for us and im sure the supporters will be just as excited as we are to have him back at manchester city
8620879 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8620880 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8620881 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8620882 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8620883 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8620939 wenn es darum geht ob israel untergehen soll oder der iran dann sollte der iran untergehen
8620940 in wahrheit herrscht in der israelischen regierung mittlerweile konsens dass ein luftangriff gegen die iranischen atomanlagen unausweichlich geworden ist

8620944 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes up short again and again because their is no effort without error or shortcoming but who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself for a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least he fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory or defeat
8620945 i think this will take place within the coming week
8620946 we have long shared an understanding on this issue so the coordination and signing process will not take long
8620947 we are now focusing on relations with russia as they allow us to solve all key issues
8620948 this question is not being discussed our status has been determined by the constitution and a national referendum
8620949 the chinese side was informed of the political and legal motives behind russias decision and expressed an understanding of them

8620952 these six politicians are the leaders and generals in charge of waging an unprecedented war on the poor
8620953 by pushing policies that restrict american energy supply and thus push prices higher they are delivering daily punishment to low income and poor families across the nation what these politicians are doing is immoral and we intend to wake up the american people to the fact that this war being waged in every city in america today
8620954 we call this a war on the poor because high energy prices disproportionately impact americas poor and low income families
8620955 with prices expected to rise this winter from 25 to 50 percent we are in a true crisis these prices are actually a highly regressive tax on americas most vulnerable citizens the war on the poor must stop to do that we must increase our supply of all energy resources including coal oil and gas nuclear power and encourage greater conservation
8620956 a recent study shows that while median income families have to devote five cents on a dollar of their income to energy costs poor families have to devote upwards of 50 cents on the dollar that is fifty cents they cant spend on health care or education or food
8620957 the poor are being decimated by high energy prices which are also driving up food costs and other necessities of life
8620958 unless we as a nation become energy independent we will have to continue sending u s troops overseas to die on foreign soil defending our access to foreign energy that is unacceptable
8620959 hes worked the night shift in the town for 30 years and has been with diamond for 19 years since we started

8620962 its a dangerous job to do and its a perfect example of how dangerous the job is and why its often difficult to get a cab late at night
8620963 although it is likely these two incidents are linked and the offenders the same we are not ruling anything out
8620964 both drivers are honest hard working men who were going about their daily work when they were subjected to violent and terrifying ordeals
8620965 i would appeal to anyone who was in the area of either incident or who recognises the descriptions of the offenders calls the police
8620966 we have been going at top speed up to now

8620989 although the rarity of the current episode of high average sunspot numbers may indicate that the sun has contributed to the unusual climate change during the twentieth century we point out that solar variability is unlikely to have been the dominant cause of the strong warming during the past three decades
8620990 since roughly 1970 the solar influence on climate through the channels considered here cannot have been dominant in particular the sun cannot have contributed more than 30 to the steep temperature increase that has taken place since then irrespective of which of the three considered channels is the dominant one determining sun climate interactions tropospheric heating caused by changes in total solar irradiance stratospheric chemistry influenced by changes in the solar uv spectrum or cloud coverage affected by the cosmic ray flux

8620993 dopo aver riaperto il traffico prima ai pedoni e poi anche alle motociclette il prossimo obiettivo la riapertura del ponte al traffico veicolare leggero ha spiegato matteo renzi due sono le soluzioni prospettate dai tecnici della provincia la prima quella pi favorevole riguarda la possibilit di poter compiere alcuni lavori di consolidamento alla base del ponte e quindi consentire il passaggio delle auto a senso alternato o meglio in entrambi i sensi
8620994 se questa prima ipotesi dovesse essere bocciata dal ctu il perito nominato dal tribunale nella causa avviata dalla provincia per il risarcimento dei danni nei confronti di eventuali responsabili gi pronta una soluzione di riserva ha aggiunto il presidente in questo caso un ponte bailey sar collocato un metro pi in alto dellattuale ponte la distanza tra le due strutture dovuta a motivi di sicurezza comunque sia le due soluzioni potranno diventare operative entro la fine dellanno 2008
8620995 la scelta fra le soluzioni a e b e leffettivo inizio dei lavori ha aggiunto renzi potr avvenire solo dopo il 5 settembre quando si svolger il sopralluogo sul ponte di rignano da parte del ctu nominato dal tribunale dopo che i rappresentanti della ditta che esegu sette anni fa i lavori allarcata del ponte mediceo non si sono presentati alle precedenti convocazioni fatte dal giudice per il 5 e il 21 agosto
8620996 latteggiamento tenuto finora dallazienda ha commentato matteo renzi ha fatto ritardare i tempi e ha fatto slittare anche la convocazione dellassemblea pubblica che pensavamo di tenere il 21 di agosto giorno in cui avremmo dovuto saperne di pi proprio perch era previsto il sopralluogo ma questo atteggiamento non ci impedir di andare avanti nella ricerca delle responsabilit non faremo nessun azzardo nei lavori tale da pregiudicare la possibilit di vincere la causa contro i responsabili se a pagare fossero ancora un volta i cittadini sarebbe una vera beffa dopo che sono stati presi in giro con la realizzazione di questa opera che era stata presentata come risolutiva degli annosi problemi del ponte di rignano crediamo che i milioni di euro derivanti dallindennizzo debbano servire per costruire finalmente un ponte nuovo che permetta anche il transito di veicoli pesanti come i pullman
8620997 quella della circonvallazione una delle pagine pi nere nella storia di rignano
8620998 la scuola in montagna rappresenta un baluardo per la cultura del luogo un sostegno alla rete di relazioni un appoggio insostituibile per la micro economia la ragione di permanenza in zona disgraziate di molte famiglie che altrimenti sarebbero costrette a trasferirsi altrove abbandonando la montagna la nostra montagna non pu permettersi altre fughe di cervelli di braccia di vita
8620999 questo provvedimento taglia scuole del governo berlusconi un tipico esempio di macelleria sociale poich colpisce in primo luogo i bambini i tagli alla scuola infatti con lultimo provvedimento il dl 112 convertito in l 133 colpiranno in modo particolare le scuole elementari e materne dei piccoli comuni e le conseguenze si cominceranno a vedere dallanno scolastico 2009 2010 nelle zone di montagna e negli altri comuni del nostro territorio quando non ci sar pi la scuola elementare i bambini saranno costretti ad alzarsi molto presto la mattina ed andare a scuola a molti chilometri di distanza con il bus o accompagnati in auto da genitori se consideriamo che il governo ha ulteriormente ridotto i fondi a disposizione dei comuni il costo dei bus dovranno accollarselo i genitori insieme agli aumenti dei costi del materiale scolastico che gi colpiscono tutte le famiglie
8621000 adesso solo attraverso la legge finanziaria con opportune modifiche commenta baronti di legambiente si pu migliorare la situazione salvare i bambini dal disagio che li sta aspettando e quindi evitare i tagli drastici che colpiscono tutto il settore della scuola questo governo con una mano ha abolito lici sulla prima casa e con laltra mano colpisce i servizi sociali come la scuola e di conseguenza il portafoglio dei cittadini quando poi si penalizzano le zone di montagna e con esse tutta litalia dei piccoli comuni si fa anche un grave danno ambientale perch si invita di fatto allo spopolamento di determinate aree territoriali vengono meno attivit di presidio e di manutenzione del territorio e aumentano i rischi di dissesto idrogeologico
8621001 il principale problema di questi tagli che non tengono conto delle specificit territoriali ha dichiarato tiziano lanzini presidente della consulta sui piccoli comuni di anci toscana la toscana ha gi razionalizzato a fine 1700 con la riforma leopoldina che accorpando i comuni pi piccoli ha portato ad una ampiezza media di 80 kmq per comune a fronte di una media italiana di 37kmq dovrebbe esser chiaro che accorpare in quel 28 di comuni lombardi con estensione inferiore ai 5kmq cosa ben diversa dallaccorpamento che potrebbe risultare su un territorio di 540kmq come quello coperto dai piccoli comuni toscani di marradi palazzuolo e firenzuola il solo territorio di firenzuola potrebbe contenere tutti i 96 comuni lombardi pi piccoli di 3kmq spostarsi da un paese allaltro in toscana non come farlo in altre regioni

8621037 until we can enter the property we do not know whether the family was inside at the time of the fire which we believe was started deliberately
8621038 once we have access to the house we will find out whether the family was inside at the time of the fire
8621039 i wanted to share some last minute good news with you in advance of our broad public announcement later on the food vendors have decided to extend their operation through labor day monday sept 1st
8621040 we choose the curators based on the ideas and the concepts they have and their interests we look at the cv and see if he or she is an interesting person to invite the system is flexible so there are no deadlines
8621041 if the visual art curators come for one month they can stay and live at the hiap residence where curators and researchers can work meet more artists and have exhibitions
8621042 we have an open call for finnish artists or artists who live in finland for certain residencies we have in collaboration with hiap every year there is a residence place in new york if a finnish artist applies for a residency abroad frame grants it and sends him abroad hiap hosts foreign artists as we dont have our own residencies

8621044 if you think health care is expensive now wait until you see what it costs when its free
8621045 its gotten to the point where doctors dont even know how much it costs them to provide this service or that service or how much an office visit should cost try asking a doctor how much an office visit costs and watch their face go blank

8621049 who should decide whether you live or die do you want the government to decide do you want a health insurer to decide whos gonna make that decision is it gonna be a government is it gonna be an insurer or is it gonna be you and me

8621069 we just wanted to give our institutions a heads up that our examiners will be focusing on how the institutions are handling cutbacks in home equity lines of credit
8621070 there are clearly rules that apply when an institution wants to suspend or reduce an equity line of credit
8621071 our goal in issuing the guidance was to bring all those rules together in one place
8621072 the only way we wont make money in these stocks is if the companies dont make it through this cycle
8621073 its hard to think the housing market wont recover eventually and that homebuilding stocks wont get back to profitability

8621093 students are seeing everyone again and there are lots of parties its easy for people to get caught up in the moment you might agree to do things when youre a bit drunk you wouldnt normally do
8621094 you can have three drinks and still make judgment calls
8621095 but when you drink excessively how much fun are you really having
8621096 drinking itself is not a bad thing but its a question of how you do it responsibly
8621097 we focus on concepts of not drinking alone and not leaving your drink alone
8621098 these are some very positive ways they can avoid drinking
8621099 the plan is to bring up our inventory if you drive by a station and see prices listed where the zeroes used to be then that station has gas
8621100 we still sell diesel and the convenience stores are open but the stations ran out of gas at different times so i cant say when they will all have gas
8621101 itll be interesting to see i expect that some countries may object
8621102 i think it ultimately is in everybodys interest to ensure there is some kind of authority in the area some kind of environmental and commercial authority
8621103 these measures will send a clear message to the world canada takes responsibility for environmental protection and enforcement in our arctic waters
8621104 our government is monitoring this developing situation and is working closely with atomic energy of canada limited and suppliers in an effort to help ensure a consistent supply of medical isotopes for canadians

8621179 our second quarter results reflect the continued effect of a slowing economy which contributed to the earnings declines we have experienced since the third quarter of 2007
8621180 a pharmaceutical product can cost as little as 5 cents in asia so it is hard to envisage a scenario in which an rfid tag costing 20 cents can be added to a product and provide added value to a patient or healthcare system
8621181 its like taking handful of molecules and throwing them at a screen
8621182 the tags are also not activated until they reach the pharmaceutical manufacturers facility and are applied on the production line adding a further safeguard against pilferage of the technology
8621183 for the user its a very simple process but that masks a complex series of processes and systems that is difficult for a counterfeiter to overcome
8621184 counterfeiters across the globe want to produce drugs that are easy to copy and have no loyalty to a brand so they focus on fast moving profitable brands with a low probability of being caught
8621185 our technology has the required complexity to dissuade counterfeiters from working on products that use it
8621186 sophistication is the key there have been some high profile failures in the asian market among companies trying to develop strategies using simple holograms that provide clear support for the need for a high tech sophisticated anti counterfeiting strategy one issue has been that drugmakers have tended to develop a strategy and then put that out to tender to several providers and that has meant that for every secured contract there are a number of disappointed providers with knowledge of the strategy and the capabilities to mimic the anti counterfeiting technology there is not a single hologram that does not have a copy in asia
8621187 in fact this technology has become a menace as it imposes an extra level of responsibility on the manufacture in defending its brand and proving that a product is counterfeit
8621188 most 2d scanners cost thousands of dollars per unit but we have pared the cost down to 100
8621189 today we are talking about a simple barcode which can be combined with the fingerprint scanner to provide a unique authentication system that is secure and commercially viable
8621190 there clearly needs to be convergence of technologies but we have tried to design the scanner with future applications not just counterfeiting in mind
8621191 the underlying base technology can also be used for compliance for example patients could be asked to scan it when they take a drug allowing their use of the medicine to be monitored
8621192 when you keep starting at square one youll never make much progress

8621197 gosnold and colleagues have detected changes in ground surface temperatures over the last 500 years by measuring the change in temperature vs depth t z in boreholes drilled in the ground sometimes up to 700 meters deep
8621198 the geophysical methods used to generate bore hole temperature reconstructions do not permit annual or decade resolution but only the century scale trend in temperatures over the last several centuries nonetheless this record totally independent of data and methods used in other studies shows the same thing the earth is warming dramatically
8621199 new findings on contaminant threats in african dust to the future of coral reefs to coral chemical defenses

8621202 co2 cant be a climate forcing because it lags temperature in the vostok ice core
8621203 as a paleoclimatologist let me tell you that anthropogenic climate change is wrong because co2 was way high in the cretaceous
8621204 that the 90 confidence in the human influence on recent trends is derived only from models
8621205 climate sensitivity is around 3 c for a doubling of co2
8621206 sedimentary layers are deposited in a time sequence with the oldest on the bottom and the youngest on the top
8621207 it is very disappointing to see his i e my current stance
8621208 a geologists consensus on a kind of rock or mountain range formation or sea floor spreading is certainly worth listening too but an endocrinologists opinion on the same thing not so much to each field their own consensus gavin
8621209 the climate has always changed in the past due to natural variability and life on earth has survived very well
8621210 it is no surprise that many of them will initially be skeptical towards claims that humans are responsible for the current changes when they are acutely aware of the massive changes that have always taken place without humans around
8621211 these results suggest that upper ocean heat content integrals and integral trends may be substantially more uncertain than has yet been acknowledged further exploration of uncertainties is needed
8621212 co2 works as a greenhouse ceiling preventing radiation out of athmosphere
8621213 theyd made the wrong choice of required science thinking theyd encounter no physics chemistry or biology theyd signed themselves into all of them
8621214 the approximate equilibrium characterizing most of earths history is unlike the current situation in which ghgs are rising at a rate much faster than the coupled climate system can respond
8621215 we all welcome novices students and even skeptics denialists ideologues obstructionists and disruptors have no place here and you know it
8621216 much more significant how much should we tolerate voices that prevent us from knowing and describing dangers to our future
8621217 i am unaware of any empirical that word again justification for the assumption that 2 deg c of warming is ipso facto dangerous
8621218 cereal grains with c3 metabolism including rice wheat barley oats and rye show yield increases ranging from 25 to 64 percent resulting from a rise in carbon fixation and reduction in photo respiration flag leaves the ones closest to grain panicles or heads show a 60 percent increase in photosynthetic rates food crops with c4 metabolism including corn sorghum millet and sugarcane show yield increases ranging from 10 to 55 percent resulting primarily from superior efficiency in water use tuber and root crops including potatoes and sweet potatoes show dramatic increase in tuberization potatoes and growth of roots sweet potatoes yield increases range from 18 to 75 percent legumes including peas beans and soybeans show yield increases of 28 to 46 percent for soybeans frequently planted not only for their food value but because they naturally fertilize the soil there is a spectacular increase in biological nitrogen fixation as will be shown below
8621219 unaware of any empirical evidence that dangerous warming or any measurable warming for that matter can be attributed to a human causation
8621220 local geological records contain countless examples of greater increases or decreases in temperature than 2 deg c the nearby animals and plants ecosystems if you like did what they always do i e shifted their geographic distributions and or adapted to the different conditions

8621222 office buildings exist which are described as sick in which workers display symptoms of carbon dioxide poisoning8
8621223 this document discusses the toxicity and exposure limits for exposure to carbon dioxide gas co2
8621224 a drager colorimetric gas detection tube used to test the co2 levels in air in an indoor air test in our laboratory the detector found that the co2 level was about 600ppm which is typical of indoor air and is an acceptable and safe level
8621225 plus we know that the most devastating episodes for life on earth recently have been cold periods not warm
8621226 voters believe that there is no consensus about global warming
8621227 therefore you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate
8621228 a compelling story even if factually inaccurate can be more emotionally compelling than a dry recitation of the truth
8621229 to ask a question in the way that you get the right answer
8621230 at the lowest n 15 to 70 kg of n haj1 the average yield increase with elevated co2 was only 9 28 just over one third of that of the chamber response table 1 although this n input treatment was considered low by the standards of intensive agriculture in the european union and united states these levels exceed the world average and may therefore be closer to the stimulation factor for crop yields across the globe
8621231 for example the major c3 herbage grass lolium perenne also showed a yield increase of only 9 at two locations and at the lowest n 100 to 140 kg of n haj1 the yield increase was an insignificant 1 table s2 28
8621232 so what did kimball et al learn from their massive review of the face literature to what degree were different plant physiological processes and properties altered by a 300 ppm increase in the airs co2 concentration with respect to net photosynthesis the rates of this process in upper canopy leaves of the several c3 grasses studied were enhanced by an average of 46 under ample water and nitrogen and by 44 when nitrogen was limiting to growth in the case of the c4 crop sorghum however the net photosynthetic enhancement at ample water and nitrogen was only 14 but when water was limiting to growth the co2 induced stimulation rose to 34 and when net photosynthesis was measured throughout the entire canopy of a c3 wheat crop the mean enhancement was 28 with respect to aboveground biomass three c3 grasses wheat ryegrass and rice experienced an average increase of 18 at ample water and nitrogen 4 at low nitrogen and 21 at low water c4 sorghum however experienced a mere 4 increase at ample water and nitrogen but a 24 increase at low water most surprising of all perhaps was potato a c3 forb which experienced a 32 decrease at ample water and nitrogen clover a c3 legume on the other hand experienced a 36 increase at ample water and nitrogen as well as a 38 increase at low nitrogen last of all woody cotton and grape plants experienced an average 48 increase at ample water and nitrogen and an average 39 increase at low water with respect to belowground biomass wheat ryegrass and rice experienced an average increase of 70 at ample water and nitrogen 58 at low nitrogen and 34 at low water clover experienced a 38 increase at ample water and nitrogen plus a 32 increase at low nitrogen outdoing them all however was cotton with a 96 increase at ample water and nitrogen with respect to agricultural yield which represents the bottom line in terms of food and fiber production ryegrass and wheat experienced an average increase of 18 at ample water and nitrogen while wheat also experienced an increase of 10 at low nitrogen and 34 at low water sorghum yield was unchanged at ample water and nitrogen but at low water it rose by 38 and potato in spite of its 32 decrease in aboveground growth experienced a yield increase of 42 at ample water and nitrogen
8621233 in the ice cores the change in temperature precedes the change in carbon dioxide
8621234 the debate part 3 and go in about 2m 45s rewind to 1m 30s to see the beginning of his comments 22 august 2008 at 8 52 am
8621235 screw it today im jumping down a victorian rabbit hole
8621236 the productivity of c3 crops the average yield stimulation observed to date is well below the potential theoretical gains this suggests there is significant room for improving productivity there are tens of thousands of lines of wheat rice soybean and other crops available but only a fraction of these have been tested for co2 responsiveness in a production environment yield is a complex phenotypic trait determined by the interactions of a genotype with the environment
8621237 technical abstract the likely effects of future high levels of atmosperic co2 on several agricultural crops were investiaged
8621238 i believe that the c in the text above is a typo and should be c3
8621239 it appears that elevated comparisons between the face based data and those from reviews of prior chamber based data were consistent which gives confidence that conclusions drawn from both types of data are accurate
8621240 only the simple question are there some benefits to co2 enhance to many members of the plant community a simple yes or no will suffice
8621241 earth has never seen co2 levels such as we are headed for
8621242 another question that comes to mind is if earth did not experience a runaway greenhouse effect when co2 levels were 4000 ppm or higher in earlier geologic history what has changed to create such alarm at levels ten times lower
8621243 precession can also have a large seasonal effect and that is modulated by eccentricity
8621244 we have to get a warming of 2 4 degrees by 2050 so what numbers should we put in to get that result
8621245 of course those whove been paying attention will recognize that gore is not wrong at all this subject has been very well addressed in numerous places indeed guest contributor jeff severinghaus addressed this in one of our very first realclimate posts way back in 2004
8621246 at x aoa thrust and drag will cause this loss of power in motion along the line of flight

8621249 how does one decide who is and who is not irrational by mental disability
8621250 sabotaging the very goal they set out to achieve by being unprepared and reactive
8621251 take time to think about what you want to do next in your career
8621252 not completely prepared are still too emotional and have no comprehensive plan for launching a job search
8621253 your resume should describe you at your highest level of accomplishment telling the story of your career and how you can help contribute to an organization
8621254 you want to make a good choice not just any choice but the right one
8621255 clicking with your would be boss is essential if you notice during an interview that you and this person dont get each other dont think that will change once you start working there
8621256 use the interview to explore whether your prospective boss is interested in what you have to say and understands whats important to you in your career before you accept the offer
8621257 if you sense theres a problem with someone youll be working with listen to what your intuition is telling you
8621258 working relationships with people you dont like will only get harder as the time you spend with them increases
8621259 wanting to be chosen by an employer sometimes makes us talk ourselves into a situation we may not have taken if we were thinking more clearly
8621260 is your workspace a priority then ask to see it before you make a decision
8621261 do you want to work from 9 to 5 be sure to ask your future boss and colleagues what their typical hours are if they arrive at work at 7 a m and leave at 8 p m dont kid yourself into thinking you can do otherwise
8621262 i work with many clients who agreed to less than ideal jobs in the belief that they would stay for just one year
8621263 but that year frequently becomes two and then more even though the job is still not satisfying an interim position is just that
8621264 letting interviewers see the real you is the only way to figure out whether youll be accepted for who you are or not
8621265 you may fool the people interviewing you but youll only be fooling yourself when you have to go in there every day and pretend to be someone youre not
8621266 these results are encouraging as they show that operators are keen to enjoy the fruits of fmc as soon as possible that said service providers need to ensure they have the correct software platform in place to ensure the transition to fmc is completed as smoothly as possible such software is already being used today an example being comptels convergent solutions the problem arises when legacy non convergent software is being used in other parts of the operators oss for example billing systems it is apparent that oss vendors need to advise operators effectively on how best to move to a fully convergent oss

8621358 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8621359 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8621360 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8621361 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8621362 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8621363 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8621364 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8621365 our second quarter results reflect the continued effects of a slowing economy which contributed to the earnings declines we have experienced since the third quarter of 2007

8621373 two thirds of adverse events after a heart attack which may be a further heart attack stroke or major bleed happen after a patient has been discharged from hospital
8621374 our findings are of concern because we believe that the risk for patients whose heart attack was originally considered not as severe may be being misjudged
8621375 this does not mean to say that all patients who have had a heart attack will need surgical intervention but that doctors should carry out a simple recommended risk assessment that unfortunately is not being routinely used but which takes in a variety of factors to help work out the best treatment
8621376 we are able to cover big quantities of the import quotas
8621377 we will be launching our new web site on 2 september

8621382 they will get 3 back and they will also earn kulula moola
8621383 we had the pilot phase six months ago and at this stage we have signed on more than 100 000 subscribers to our get connected for less product
8621384 the use of cellphones and the internet through wireless technology wifi on board aircraft in sa is regulated by the sa caa
8621385 it has taken the view that our legislation does not allow the use of such technology while in flight and thus it is illegal to make use of cellphones and other unapproved transmitting devices saa was the first local airline to apply for our customers to use the flight mode of some cellphones but we were turned down
8621386 in the interim saa will once again approach the sa caa to allow the use of flight mode on current cellphones
8621387 if the technical departments within sa caa or members of the industry have not identified that there is a need for a change in regulations regarding the use of cellphones then the change would not be made
8621388 also if this is a global trend in the industry then such a directive will come from organisations such as the international civil aviation organisation in this case we will be forced to change the regulations as such

8621396 the industry forces have been bearing down on the entire industry dealer network
8621397 frankly in the last four or five months its been very challenging to our dealers
8621398 if there was a pace there is no plan to be at two times the pace or three times the pace
8621399 at some point youre in competition with your fellow dealers
8621400 look at some of the other manufacturers that have quite a lot less number of dealers its going to make us stronger
8621401 now we can look to the future everything that was playing against us now is going for us
8621402 but by misuse of the provision ipc 498a dowry and cruelty law a new legal terrorism can be unleashed the provision is intended to be used a shield and not an assassins weapon
8621403 it is known that an estranged wife will go to any extent to rope in as many relatives of the husband as possible in a desperate effort to salvage whatever remains of an estranged marriage
8621404 for the fault of the husband the in laws or other relatives cannot in all cases be held to be involved the acts attributed to such persons have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and they cannot be held responsible by mere conjectures and implications the tendency to rope in relatives of the husband as accused has to be curbed
8621405 roping in of the whole of the family including brothers and sisters in law has to be depreciated unless there is a specific material against these persons it is down right on the part of the police to include the whole of the family as accused
8621406 whether one spouse has been guilt of cruelty to the other is essentially a question of fact the impact of complaints accusation or taunts on a person amounting to cruelty depends on various factors like the sensitivity of the victim concerned the social background the environment education etc further mental cruelty varies from person to person depending on the intensity of the sensitivity degree of courage and endurance to withstand such cruelty each case has to be decided on its own facts whether mental cruelty is made out
8621407 these provisions were though made with good intentions but the implementation has left a very bad taste and the move has been counter productive there is a growing tendency amongst the women which is further perpetuated by their parents and relatives to rope in each and every relative including minors and even school going kids nearer or distant relatives and in some cases against every person of the family of the husband whether living away or in other town or abroad and married unmarried sisters sisters in law unmarried brothers married uncles and in some cases grand parents or as many as 10 o 15 or even more relatives of the husband
8621408 from the reading of the fir it is evident that there is no specific allegation of any act against petitioners nos 2 and 3 which constitute offence under s 498 a i p c i am satisfied that these two persons have been falsely implicated in the present case who were minors at the time of marriage and even at the time of lodging the present fir neither of these two persons was alleged to have been entrusted with any dowry article nor they alleged to have ever demanded any dowry article no specific allegation of demand of dowry harassment and beating given to the complainant by the two accused has been made the allegations made are vague and general moreover it cannot be ignored that every member of the family of the husband has been implicated in the case the initiation of criminal proceedings against them in the present case is clearly an abuse of the process of law
8621409 in the instant case it appears that that the criminal case has been filed which is manifestly intended with mala fide and ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge
8621410 the object of the provision is prevention of the dowry menace
8621411 16 4 4 in less tolerant impulsive woman may lodge an fir even on a trivial act the result is that the husband and his family may be immediately arrested and there may be a suspension or loss of job the offence alleged being non bailable innocent persons languish in custody there may be a claim for maintenance adding fuel to fire if the husband cannot pay she may change her mind and get into the mood to forget and forgive the husband may realize the mistakes committed and come forward to turn a new leaf for a loving and cordial relationship the woman may like to seek reconciliation but this may not be possible due to the legal obstacles even if she wishes to make amends by withdrawing the complaint she can not do so as the offence is non compoundable the doors for returning to family life stand closed she is thus left at the mercy of her natal family 16 4 5 this section therefore helps neither the wife nor the husband the offence being non bailable and non compoundable makes an innocent person undergo stigmatization and hardship heartless provisions that make the offence non bailable and non compoundable operate against reconciliations it is therefore necessary to make this offence a bailable and b compoundable to give a chance to the spouses to come together 118 the code may be suitably amended to make the offence under section 498 a of the i p code bailable and compoundable
8621412 many instances have come to light where the complaints are not bona fide and have been filed with an oblique motive in such cases acquittal of the accused does not wipe out the ignominy suffered during and prior to the trial sometimes adverse media coverage adds to the misery
8621413 there were pot seeds around and i would pick them up my mum thought it was funny if i ate them
8621414 while we have shown that the new probe can work for two types of procedures we believe that results will be more far reaching
8621415 there are many catheter based interventional procedures where 3 d ultrasound guidance could be used including heart valve replacements and placement of coils in the brain to prevent stroke wherever a catheter can go the probe can go
8621416 while the images obtained this way are good some patients experience adverse reactions to the contrast agent
8621417 also the images gained this way are fleeting the 3 d ultrasound guidance does not use x ray radiation or contrast agents and the images are real time and continuous
8621418 these tiny transducers work together to create one large transducer working much like the compound eyes of insects
8621419 i believe we have shown that 3 d ultrasound clearly works in a wide variety of interventional procedures
8621420 we envision a time in the not too distant future when this technology becomes standard equipment in various catheter kits

8621448 the way you see me today i havent felt this good in 30 years
8621449 i wake up refreshed my appetites better and the mental clarity is coming back i thought id lost it forever but i didnt
8621450 i didnt really mean what i said in the bible
8621451 theres still a group of people out there who are not convinced that their particular party has nominated or is about to nominate the best of the best and when we find 22 3 percent in a three way race between obama mccain and none of the above said none of the above 37 8 percent said obama and 27 percent chose mccain it just shows theres a weakness among the two candidates for their support that theyll have to shore up over time
8621452 we had 44 8 percent who said they could be very likely at 20 or somewhat likely at 24 8 percent to support a strong third party candidate in november if one might emerge the candidates have to be doing similar polling and know that their support is there but its not strong support and their folks could bolt to someone else rather easily
8621453 what a lot of pollsters are doing and were guilty of it too is were not offering other options the choice is obama or mccain and thats it and thats what they do they say ok youre undecided who are you leaning towards and then they throw those people into the mccain column or the barack obama column
8621454 here for the first time in a while a pollster comes along and says ok you have a third option none of the above in addition to dont know and it gets you thinking i always wanted to vote for condoleezza rice mccain is my third choice ill end up voting for him probably but heres a pollster whos giving me the choice to voice my view that no mccain or obama wasnt my first choice
8621455 that the two imprisoned men were not guilty and that their convictions should be dropped

8621457 ordered to go to a hearing present the governments case and let a judge decide a strategy that violated his sense of a prosecutors duty
8621458 i worked for what i thought was the right thing
8621459 for another lawyers violation of the rules of professional conduct if
8621460 a lawyer is bound by the rules of professional conduct notwithstanding that the lawyer acted at the direction of another person
8621461 knowingly mak ing a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal or fail ing to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made to the tribunal
8621462 continued pendency of criminal charges when the prosecutor knows that the charges are not supported by probable cause or in the absence of sufficient admissible evidence to support a conviction
8621463 t he responsibility of a public prosecutor differs from that of the usual advocate his duty is to seek justice not merely convict this special duty exists because the prosecutor represents the sovereign and therefore should use restraint in the discretionary exercise of governmental powers such as in the selection of cases to prosecute
8621464 offices position is x but my own view is y
8621465 judge ive been a prosecutor for twenty years because of new evidence my office assigned me to reinvestigate the case based on that investigation i have real doubts about whether this man committed the crimes for which he was convicted but my office is full of qualified prosecutors and the prevailing sentiment in the office is that the evidence old and new supports the defendants guilt therefore the office opposes the motion for a new trial and i am ready to present argument in support of that position
8621466 does not violate the rules of professional conduct if that lawyer acts in accordance with a supervisory lawyers reasonable resolution of an arguable question of professional duty
8621467 a prosecutor should not be compelled by his or her supervisor to prosecute a case in which he or she has a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused

8621485 our goal is to pull back the curtain on the ugly truth
8621486 the leaders of the national rifle association who have long claimed to represent hunters and shooters have instead overwhelmingly supported the biggest conservation opponents in congress
8621487 unlike wayne lapierre chief executive officer of the nra i dont fly on private jets and my salary is a dollar a year i can also outshoot lapierre and ill gladly challenge him to a wild hunt thats a challenge i look forward to but i wont hold my breath that hell ever take it

8621494 the importance of concluding this fta goes beyond simply trade benefits the agreement is also critical to new zealand s longer term strategic engagement and interactions with the asia pacific region

8621521 there is therefore a risk that banks use the ecb as lender of first resort rather than last resort
8621522 since at least the beginning of 2008 persistent market talk has it that spanish and dutch banks may be in that game getting an effective subsidy from the ecb and becoming overly dependent on the ecb as the funding source of first choice

8621707 door de laadbak heeft de auto een grijs kenteken en je rijdt op gas
8621708 de winst hangt van het type auto af het verschilt van 4 procent op goedkope autos tot 10 procent op duurdere modellen
8621709 en dan valt in een klap het grootste gedeelte van je winst weg

8621723 cumulatively as the village of homer looks at this process its a very long process
8621724 and there are different reasons for it but now were down to the illinois environmental protection agency not providing these permits the net of this is its been eight years in the making and people are getting weary and want to see some progress and now were up against a bureaucratic wall
8621725 and it definitely has taken longer due to iepa staffing reductions
8621726 due to that the current window for financing is closed and that has shoved homer off till the next window april 1 2009
8621727 staff cuts and bleeding these agencies to death is starting to take its toll
8621728 i dont have a problem with being lean and mean but you have to have enough people to get your workload done
8621729 its admittedly a process with a lot of steps and it has been a challenge with our shrinking staff numbers to keep up with the number of requests coming in
8621730 i dont want to sound critical of the iepa since i think i know what theyre up against
8621731 but the permits need to be provided in a timely manner delays cost everyone money
8621732 we certainly want to get a contract settled as soon as possible
8621733 in the past weve kept on trying to hammer it out and have gone into october
8621734 we just dont want that to happen its not right to our members to drag it out that long

8621747 its perfectly normal changing bodies growing up sex and sexual health
8621748 i think what sen obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas
8621749 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8621750 my goodness its amazing that were three days into the democratic convention and 60 or so days from the actual election and theyre still trying to plead with the american people and convince us that barack obama is ready to be president
8621751 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8621752 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8621753 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8621754 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8621755 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8621756 our community consists of a huge number of different religions all of which should be valued and no one religion should be accorded more status or influence than others

8621763 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8621764 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8621765 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8621766 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8621767 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8621768 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8621769 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8621770 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8621771 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8621772 donald when you go out to your all mogul lunches and dinners when you sit around with the other people who have where theyre very successful what do they say who is the better president with the better philosophy and principles for you whos going to make you richer whos going to make the country better
8621773 i think from a business standpoint they like sen john mccain because they like his taxing policies this is a very fragile economy its an economy thats not doing well the worst thing that can happen is everybody has to pay double and triple the taxes and thats what sen barack obama is looking to do
8621774 the lawyers are proving how organised they are that they have total consensus and this protest will continue until the chief justice is restored
8621775 those judges who have taken a new oath of their offices have accepted the illegal actions of former president pervez musharraf
8621776 we are not fighting for our jobs but for principles
8621777 these are the donors who we will need to raise money for sen obama
8621778 youve seen the numbers on the donor side which are nowhere near the potential that could be achieved from the clinton side
8621779 the first time we called the list it was tough the second time was tough but weve gotten some commitments
8621780 right now we have five or six helping after the convention we hope to have many more
8621781 indicate that unity is not just a one way street but a two way street and enable certain people that have not yet been able to become involved to become more fully engaged
8621782 should be the poster child for how clinton donors and obamas finance team get along
8621783 we have a level of trust and history that allows us to do it
8621784 there has been no reaching out no deep gestures of appreciation and respect
8621785 im miffed by this and shes working her heart out for him
8621786 we have commissioned kpmg to do a report on the equestrian shooting and basketball venues looking at whether the olympic experience and the legacy they will provide represents value for money
8621787 when you take the costs for these venues it seems like a lot of money to a lot of people it is a sort of testing to destruction to see whether that spending can be justified
8621788 gosh andy you did that backwards most people start at the source and then talk about the destination
8621789 thats a trick question andy i know it but i think we need one for each sql server instance out there

8621797 the cities power plants and factories we build in the next seven years will shape our climate in mid century we have to act now to price carbon and create incentives to change the way we use energy and spread technology and thereby avert nothing less than an existential threat to civilization

8621802 preston the head chef at six meat buffet wants to put his meat in your mouth
8621803 right minded thinking basted in the tasty sauce of truth
8621804 im not sure if preston is trying to put out a humorous blog or not but his writings keep me laughing
8621805 tenderized boned and free from nasty by products i love six meat buffet

8621809 what i have learned from this site is that i now know where mouth breathers and knuckle draggers come to get their rocks off
8621810 i dont know how far ahead they planned that we obviously revealed our drum kit much earlier than they did
8621811 ive a feeling there was a oh s theres cymbals how can we put cymbals on our kit that would be the easiest way without having to rewire everything and re engineer the entire circuit board
8621812 it might just look like more songs but really the technology that were pushing forward and some of the features weve added its not just a title update it really is a new game with a lot of really great stuff
8621813 we actually have expansion ports on the back of our drum kits that let you attach three cymbals to your drum set
8621814 at harmonix we really are musicians first and game people second my drum set has three cymbals on it i dont know how many drum sets youve seen with two cymbals on them i guess thats a question for other people
8621815 der trainer hat ja deutlich genug kundgetan dass er sich hier nicht wohl f hlt
8621816 the way im going to look at this from now on is to think of the entire audience not as 200 people but a person directly in front of you that youre demoing your deck to the seats are empty

8621826 our manufacturing operations in asia have been running at capacity to satisfy demand in china
8621827 our outlook for sales and revenues this year still reflects another record year of growth in sales and revenues to caterpillar and for that matter for earnings
8621828 what is particularly impressive is that we have been able to sustain growth and strong earnings in the face of very severe recessionary conditions in our domestic market in the united states
8621829 the jury found that at some point the dolls infringed but the question is was it the earlier dolls or the later dolls or all of them
8621830 without a special verdict form its difficult to see how an injunction would be styled
8621831 the main bratz brand will always remain with mga and we are going full blast forward and nothing will stop us
8621832 the jury made a determination about damages but it didnt make a determination about the connection between the drawings and the damages
8621833 the stakes still remain very very high for mga theyre not out of the woods yet at all
8621834 the real prize is going to be can mattel convince the judge to grant an injunction that would prevent mga from ever producing another bratz product
8621835 our members and retirees have earned a fair and equitable contract through years of hard work sacrifice and uncertainty
8621836 the company and union have reached tentative agreements on many of the outstanding issues but continue negotiating on a handful of topics
8621837 current position does not do justice to our needs and demands and does not match the pattern set by the u s steel agreement
8621838 but it usually is a sign of impatience in bargaining
8621839 a strike vote is putting a bullet in the chamber
8621840 a sign that negotiations have really reached a stage where intensity in bargaining is necessary and you have to break from the past trend

8621857 ive been approached so many times but i look at writing books as something you do in your 80s when you have no more chapters left in life
8621858 my book would be boring because i would never write about my castmates whether i liked them or not when youre working on a set thats a sacred and private experience its not supposed to end up in a book for somebody to make money off of

8621871 laughed at the suggestion and certainly did not call mccain on it
8621872 reports of strong support within john mccains presidential campaign for independent democratic sen joseph lieberman as the republican candidate for vice president are not a fairy tale
8621873 brooks like the idea of the pairing while the religious right is already
8621874 they took everything they wanted even the fans they beat up a man using sticks and a chair and then threw him in the river

8621880 after ahmadinejad was elected president iranian supreme leader ali khamenei asked us to be patient with the economic policy but after his three years in office our patience has run out in light of his lack of privatization policy

8621882 ive always admired him and hes certainly been a target of mine since i came to the football club
8621883 to actually secure the deal and bring shaun back home is a fantastic coup for us and im sure the supporters will be just as excited as we are to have him back at manchester city
8621884 he doesnt want to join either of them and we are now discussing the next move to see what we do
8621885 because of all the problems there at manchester city and the uncertainty surrounding the place he is unsure
8621886 he is speaking with the manager luiz felipe scolari at the moment but he is settled in london he would like to stay and thats the bottom line but it is up to the manager
8621887 we are looking at all the options really at this moment in time so i cant really say much more
8621888 we agreed on 2 000 rupees and he upped it to 2 700 61 just like that

8621892 then its all up to god as water levels are rising
8621893 everything else is gone i have had everything robbed from me
8621894 its because of the respect we have for them and the enormity of the challenge we have in front of us trying to win back to back south african test matches and in johannesburg for the first time in so long that we feel we need to bring in some fresh legs
8621895 last weekend in durban took a lot out of our guys as it did some of theirs we will need the impetus that the fresh legs weve included today will bring

8621897 flirting is age old but the fact that it can now be tracked on your phone makes a nervous partner a paranoid text checker
8621898 i think what sen obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas

8621900 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8621901 my goodness its amazing that were three days into the democratic convention and 60 or so days from the actual election and theyre still trying to plead with the american people and convince us that barack obama is ready to be president
8621902 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8621903 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8621904 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8621905 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8621906 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need

8621925 with the rising awareness of the problem has come mounting concern about the access to treatment and whether enough combat veterans are receiving the help that is available to them having cut way back in the 1990s as the population of veterans declined the veterans health administration says it is expanding its alcohol and drug abuse services but advocacy groups and independent experts including members of a pentagon mental health task force that issued its report last year are concerned that much more needs to be done in may the house and senate passed bills that would require the veterans agency to expand substance abuse screening and treatment for all veterans
8621926 for active duty service members the military faces a shortage of substance abuse providers on bases across the country while its health insurance plan tricare makes it difficult for many reservists and their families to get treatment
8621927 research has shown that the likelihood of mental health problems rises with the intensity of combat exposure in a recent rand corporation study one in five veterans of iraq and afghanistan reported symptoms of combat stress or major depression in turn service members with such problems more often report heavy drinking or illicit drug use nytimes com
8621928 in part this dynamic is rooted in the warrior code trained to be tough and ignore their fear many combat veterans are reluctant to acknowledge psychic wounds or they worry that getting help will damage their careers
8621929 the military generally discharges them arguing that they can no longer do their jobs and refers them to veterans clinics however some experts argue that the military should treat some who started using drugs after fighting in war

8621932 particularities are imperfections the source of error parochialism and prejudice truth by contrast is abstract timeless universal and the same everywhere for everyone
8621933 western religion has been haunted by platos ghost the result is inevitable and tragic if all truth religious as well as scientific is the same for everyone at all times then if i am right you are wrong if i care about truth i must convert you to my point of view and if you refuse to be converted beware from this flowed some of the great crimes of history and much human blood

8621936 when last the democrats decided to make national security a theme at their convention biography was everything
8621937 ar on terror formulation and tactics for addressing the al qaeda terrorist network
8621938 when the democrats talk tonight about national security 2004 will appear like a long forgotten sepia toned era
8621939 along with this new vigor on foreign policy is a sense of political confidence that the public is ready in the wake of the failures of the bush era to embrace liberal solutions for national security by contrast it will be the republicans in minnesota who rely on war heroism to distract from their continuity with the bush era
8621940 unlike his rivals for the democratic nomination and his predecessor for it obama surrounded himself not with the sensible center of democratic foreign policy advisers but those who found themselves out of favor in democratic circles for being too liberal they were considered too opposed to the war in iraq too opposed to accommodating bush and too forthright about traditional liberal internationalism the hawkish richard holbrooke a close confident of sen hillary rodham clinton al gore and kerry is out while his old friend and rival the relatively dovish anthony lake is in
8621941 yet what the obama campaign has already proven is that unlike in 2004 the choice facing the country is between the left most and right most poles of foreign policy thinking in the two parties
8621942 the impact of an election that produces an obama presidency is huge craig said since obama would be the nations first african american president i think it strengthens the capacity of the president to lead mccain has a strategy to remain in iraq and if thats what country wants they can vote on it naturally of course craig doesnt think the country will

8621965 everyone involved in irish tourism has acknowledged that our tourist trade is not immune to the challenging economic conditions in ireland and overseas particularly in some of our largest overseas source markets
8621966 nevertheless these figures from the cso show that over 3 7 million overseas visitors came to ireland in the first half of the year representing an increase of over 2 6 per cent on the first six months of 2007
8621967 the north american numbers must be seen in the context of a record year for irish tourism last year consumer sentiment in the us fuel costs and the dollar euro exchange rate

8621977 our financial results in recent years have mirrored the consistent improvement we have achieved in our business and we finish the year with a stronger business
8621978 we enter the new financial year facing slowing global growth and more challenging global economic trends
8621979 but given the strength and diversity of diageos business we believe we can deliver organic for the coming year within our range of 7 0 9 0 percent
8621980 the main drivers of growth were international where scotch in and beer in africa drove net sales growth of 16 percent and north america where growth in the priority brands drove a 5 0 percent increase in net sales

8622067 consumers are purchasing our playstation 3 video game consoles faster than we can produce them

8622070 the wii is a well made device that has found a new target group for a while we held the same target group with the singstar karaoke game but perhaps we neglected to pursue that avenue
8622071 the major difference lies in the fact that nintendo makes money with the hardware alone which may be a superior business model but the wii is not succeeding at our expense it is not hurting us we decided years ago to build a game console that offers much greater functionality the playstation 3 has an enormous processor it is gradually emerging as the central server in our users homes
8622072 in the meantime we earn money with the games we are currently at the stage in which we need to get a grip on the production costs that takes time we are already making more money with the games than we are losing with the hardware

8622081 whats at risk here is the role of well researched serious journalism to act as a check and balance in the system of democracy
8622082 online media can replace part of it the four websites im involved in employ 30 or 40 full time journalists which is quite a lot in independent media terms but compared with 300 or 400 journalists on big daily newspapers it is fairly small
8622083 need to look at it now and think if we dont do anything then in a decades time the idea of well resourced quality journalism with hundreds of journalists covering parliament and business and investigative journalism and the courts will be gone

8622158 the big difference i can see is that save for the last few years the vast majority of americas wealth accumulated over time and from the productive honest toil of citizens who forged metal cracked bullwhips and invented light bulbs
8622159 if the american economy is drunk on its own home brew of irrational exuberance dubai is sucking down straight tequila shots and desperately trying to catch up

8622175 we had very few penalties seven against michigan our kicking game two field goals was pretty solid against michigan those two things alone kept us in the game it gave us a chance and the way it turned out a mistake in the kicking game probably cost michigan an opportunity to win the game
8622176 in our passing game its going to be quick throws getting the ball out as quick as we can
8622177 well try to run away from them and make them chase us hopefully theyll get tired by the second half
8622178 obviously theyre a quality program but playing a team like michigan with tradition like that it was definitely surprising
8622179 i guess were just preparing we respect all of our opponents and well be ready to go like any other week
8622180 were looking forward to it i think both schools are looking forward to it
8622181 theyre the defending national champions so are we even though theres a huge gap in there and lsu knows that just as well as we do its a great challenge for us

8622233 theres been a lot of talk about bringing another forward in and hopefully we can do that to strengthen the team to help us spread it out
8622234 but if a forward doesnt come in then im sure we can deal with that id probably have to stay up more then and ive no problem with that over the last two years weve spread the goals out amongst the team so as long as were doing that then i dont see a problem
8622235 dont judge my game purely on my goals judge it on goals assists and how i help the team play thats the way my game is im a team player everyones talking about how i should score more goals but we won the premier league and the champions league last season so if that happened again then id be delighted so ive got no problem at the minute

8622256 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8622257 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8622258 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8622259 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8622260 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8622278 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

8622282 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui

8622289 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
8622290 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
8622291 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
8622292 we have no tv ads that are airing right now
8622293 it gives you an advantage because you can prepare internally without letting on in an attempt to catch your opponents off guard
8622294 in the context of modern politics thats a pretty significant advantage
8622295 fixed election dates prevent governments from calling snap elections for short term political advantage
8622296 they level the playing field for all parties and the rules are clear for everybody
8622297 we have an increasingly difficult parliamentary situation because we have increasingly divergent views on a range of issues whether its the economy the environment the criminal justice system the view of our country in the world
8622298 those will obviously all be issues on which the various parties will contrast their positions when we get into an actual election campaign
8622299 i have a team of experts that has been on site for three days looked at all the data and they have yet to be able to say what they feel is the root cause
8622300 i think theyll be able to narrow the scope into a range of possibilities but i dont think theyll be able to come up with a definitive answer
8622301 i dont know the exact date but positive results for listeria inside a food plant are common
8622302 they review maple leafs records on a regular basis and they review our remedial plans and actions
8622303 i absolutely do not believe that this is a failure of the canadian food safety system or the regulators
8622304 knowing that there is a desire to assign blame i want to reiterate that the buck stops right here
8622305 im not suggesting that that is an option in this case when product is recalled then a range of options can be employed
8622306 disposal and destruction is one of those options product may go to rendering and through rendering then that product can be reworked the listeria would be destroyed and that product could then be used in the production of animal feed provided that the product meets our requirements
8622307 just because its gone out the door you dont know you simply dont know theres no statistical way to test that product adequately
8622308 to test a product you destroy the product to test 100 per cent of the product means you destroy 100 per cent of your product
8622309 we do plan to change the system to make sure that we have greater responsibility on those who ultimately market the product there has to be shared responsibility
8622310 there is no system in the world where every product is inspected all the time thats just not feasible throughout this particular crisis we will evaluate everything weve learned from it and make sure that the changes we are making will prevent this kind of thing from ever happening again
8622311 not approved by the food and drug administration for the purpose of treating life threatening injuries
8622312 the untested issue is what the defense health board doesnt like
8622313 we want the soldiers to receive the same care that would be approved by the fda in the united states
8622314 at this point there is not strong evidence to believe that fresh whole blood gives a better outcome
8622315 if men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely hebrew
8622316 surely i was sinful at birth sinful from the time my mother conceived me
8622317 is unchanged and unchangeable therefore by the authority which christ conferred upon peter and his successors i declare that direct abortion that is abortion willed as an end or as a means always constitutes a grave moral disorder since it is the deliberate killing of an innocent human being this doctrine is based upon the natural law and upon the written word of god is transmitted by the churchs tradition and taught by the ordinary and universal magisterium no circumstance no purpose no law whatsoever can ever make licit an act which is intrinsically illicit since it is contrary to the law of god which is written in every human heart knowable by reason itself and proclaimed by the church
8622318 the second commandment of the teaching you shall not murder you shall not commit adultery you shall not seduce boys you shall not commit fornication you shall not steal you shall not practice magic you shall not use potions you shall not procure an abortion nor destroy a newborn child
8622319 the way of light then is as follows if anyone desires to travel to the appointed place he must be zealous in his works the knowledge therefore which is given to us for the purpose of walking in this way is the following thou shalt not slay the child by procuring abortion nor again shalt thou destroy it after it is born
8622320 and near that place i saw another strait place and there sat women and over against them many children who were born to them out of due time sat crying and there came forth from them rays of fire and smote the women in the eyes and these were the accursed who conceived and caused abortion
8622321 what man of sound mind therefore will affirm while such is our character that we are murderers
8622322 in our case a murder being once for all forbidden we may not destroy even the fetus in the womb while as yet the human being derives blood from the other parts of the body for its sustenance to hinder a birth is merely a speedier man killing nor does it matter whether you take away a life that is born or destroy one that is coming to birth that is a man which is going to be one you have the fruit already in its seed
8622323 among surgeons tools there is a certain instrument which is formed with a nicely adjusted flexible frame for opening the uterus first of all and keeping it open it is further furnished with an annular blade by means of which the limbs of the child within the womb are dissected with anxious but unfaltering care its last appendage being a blunted or covered hook wherewith the entire fetus is extracted by a violent delivery
8622324 there is also another instrument in the shape of a copper needle or spike by which the actual death is managed in this furtive robbery of life they give it from its infanticide function the name of
8622325 the doctors who performed abortions all knew well enough that a living being had been conceived and they pitied this most luckless infant state which had first to be put to death to escape being tortured alive
8622326 now we allow that life begins with conception because we contend that the soul also begins from conception life taking its commencement at the same moment and place that the soul does
8622327 the law of moses indeed punishes with due penalties the man who shall cause abortion ex
8622328 there are some pagan women who by drinking medical preparations extinguish the source of the future man in their very bowels and thus commit a parricide before they bring forth and these things assuredly come down from the teaching of your false gods to us christians it is not lawful either to see or hear of homicide
8622329 women who were reputed to be believers began to take drugs to render themselves sterile and to bind themselves tightly so as to expel what was being conceived since they would not on account of relatives and excess wealth want to have a child by a slave or by any insignificant person see then into what great impiety that lawless one has proceeded by teaching adultery and murder at the same time
8622330 concerning women who commit fornication and destroy that which they have conceived or who are employed in making drugs for abortion a former decree excluded them until the hour of death and to this some have assented nevertheless being desirous to use somewhat greater lenity we have ordained that they fulfill ten years of penance according to the prescribed degrees
8622331 he that kills another with a sword or hurls an axe at his own wife and kills her is guilty of willful murder not he who throws a stone at a dog and unintentionally kills a man or who corrects one with a rod or scourge in order to reform him or who kills a man in his own defense when he only designed to hurt him but the man or woman is a murderer that gives a philtrum if the man that takes it dies upon it so are they who take medicines to procure abortion and so are they who kill on the highway and rapparees
8622332 wherefore i beseech you flee fornication why sow where the ground makes it its care to destroy the fruit where there are many efforts at abortion where there is murder before the birth for even the harlot you do not let continue a mere harlot but make her a murderess also you see how drunkenness leads to prostitution prostitution to adultery adultery to murder or rather to a something even worse than murder for i have no name to give it since it does not take off the thing born but prevents its being born why then do thou abuse the gift of god and fight with his laws and follow after what is a curse as if a blessing and make the chamber of procreation a chamber for murder and arm the woman that was given for childbearing unto slaughter for with a view to drawing more money by being agreeable and an object of longing to her lovers even this she is not backward to do so heaping upon thy head a great pile of fire for even if the daring deed be hers yet the causing of it is thine
8622333 i cannot bring myself to speak of the many virgins who daily fall and are lost to the bosom of the church their mother some go so far as to take potions that they may insure barrenness and thus murder human beings almost before their conception some when they find themselves with child through their sin use drugs to procure abortion and when as often happens they die with their offspring they enter the lower world laden with the guilt not only of adultery against christ but also of suicide and child murder
8622334 thou shalt not use magic thou shalt not use witchcraft for he says you shall not suffer a witch to live ex 22 18 thou shall not slay thy child by causing abortion nor kill that which is begotten i f it be slain it shall be avenged as being unjustly destroyed

8622375 i know that if i ever smoked pot i would probably become like a total pothead because i think i would like that
8622376 i have like a chill personality so thats why im never going to start because i dont like to be dependent on anything i dont even drink coffee
8622377 i would have a very different career right now and im happy where im at
8622378 i was like all right man im ready i was eager that was great because i just sort of was fueled you know
8622379 she came up to my dressing room and she was crying and she was like im so proud of you
8622380 i dont get showtime so i dont have any great reference for him and so when he came in to see us last november we couldnt believe that there was this guy who was so charismatic and such a good actor and then when he opened his mouth and sang for us all the little hairs on our arms stood up
8622381 i feel like we just had a very fortuitous moment just the right person the right time the right part
8622382 he has a very empathetic spirit and it allows him to climb into the character from the inside out and in a kind of complete and authentic way hes so big hearted as a person that he can stand at the center of the story and the audience wants to climb in with him and thats such a gift
8622383 but they definitely put you in a box and my parents were very lenient and very open minded and let me explore for myself what i felt was right and wrong and they raised all their kids that way and none of us have problems with alcohol or drugs
8622384 silas is totally opposite of me and also not as smart as melchior
8622385 so silas is like the stupid version of not being me and melchior is like the smart intellectual version of not being me but i like doing that i like being able to play roles that are totally different from me
8622386 i like people and i like characters and i like jumping out of myself
8622387 to fall into the same trap and i want him to feel some remorse for what hes done he sets his mind on a woman lures her in and once he gets what he wants he refuses to ever speak to them again and i dont think he understands the damage hes caused
8622388 i adored the guy i didnt want him to think he was a dud in bed
8622389 he told me hes an insomniac and that its hard for him not to sleep in his own bed he also mentioned he hadnt had company in a while he said he had an early meeting with the yankees and he might be allergic to the pillows in the hotel bed
8622390 i practically begged him to explain what i did wrong i told him i deserved some kind of explanation for such a dismissal but i never heard from him again

8622405 here was a fellow information hound we both read books and were curious and thoughtful about the world i never ceased to be surprised by his fascination with economic detail the effect of canadian lumber on housing prices and inflation he had an eye for the big picture too
8622406 i didnt really get it until very late in 2005 and 2006
8622407 we wanted to shut down the possibility of corrosive deflation
8622408 we were willing to chance that by cutting rates we thought might foster a bubble an inflationary boom of some sort which we would subsequently have to address it was a decision done right

8622792 i cannot circumvent the situation which has developed in south ossetia and caucasus as a whole recent developments have raised great concern over the future and safety in this region the attempted forceful solution of the conflict resulted in deaths of civilians in south ossetia and georgia as well as deaths among russian peacemakers
8622793 seriously undermined the potential for political and legal resolution of this ethno territorial problem

8622803 also one quarter does not a recovery make and well get final data on q2 gdp in september september 26
8622804 it will be difficult if not impossible to match that gdp growth rate in q3 and q4
8622805 we have a housing sector in a deep recession job losses in most job categories a pullback in consumer spending very high energy prices heading into the winter season and cautious businesses looking to cut costs where possible
8622806 these are not factors that lead to chinese style growth levels
8622807 seriously i view the revised q2 gdp as a momentary increase the headwinds facing the economy remain which is why the fed u s federal reserve should resume cutting interest rates when it meets in september

8622825 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8622826 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8622827 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8622828 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8622829 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8622834 our ice breaking research vessel polarstern is currently on a scientific mission in the arctic ocean departing from iceland the route has taken the ship through the northwest passage into the canadian basin where geophysical and geological studies will be carried out along profiles into the makarov basin to study the tectonic history and submarine geology of the central arctic ocean in addition oceanographic as well as biological studies will be carried out polarstern will circumnavigate the whole arctic ocean and exit through the northeast passage
8622835 the polar regions especially the arctic are very sensitive indicators of climate change the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change has shown that these regions are highly vulnerable to rising temperatures and predicted that the arctic would be virtually ice free in the summer months by 2070 other scientists claim it could become ice free as early as 2040 latest satellite observations suggest that the arctic could be mainly ice free even earlier
8622836 at awi we place particular emphasis on studying arctic sea ice and along with in situ studies of sea ice thickness change satellite data have been used extensively not only for the regular observation of changes in the arctic and antarctic but also for optimising the operation of polarstern in regions covered by sea ice

8622838 this is the largest investigation to date to compare fracture rates in hiv infected patients with those of non infected controls
8622839 this very large study group with more than 8 500 hiv infected patients and over two million controls has the power to detect significant differences in risk for both men and women at critical sites such as the hip and spine risks that increased with age
8622840 these data indicate that we should screen hiv infected patients both men and women for low bone density as they age
8622841 we also need to learn more about the mechanisms of this bone loss whether antiviral drugs the virus itself or other metabolic factors are responsible and investigate specific fracture rates for women before and after menopause
8622842 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
8622843 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8622844 non leafy surroundings or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animals eyes
8622845 animals outside of leafy environments do not have to deal with clutter no matter how big or small they are so there is never any x ray advantage to forward facing eyes for them
8622846 because binocular vision does not help them see any better than monocular vision they are able to survey a much greater region with sideways facing eyes
8622847 this x ray vision makes it possible for animals with forward facing eyes to visually survey a much greater region around themselves than sideways facing eyes would allow
8622848 additionally the larger the animal in a cluttered environment the more forward facing its eyes will be to allow for the greatest x ray vision possible in order to aid in hunting running from predators and maneuvering through dense forest or jungle
8622849 in todays world humans have more in common visually with tiny mice in a forest than with a large animal in the jungle we arent faced with a great deal of small clutter and the things that do clutter our visual field cars and skyscrapers are much wider than the separation between our eyes so we cant use our x ray power to see through them
8622850 if we froze ourselves today and woke up a million years from now its possible that it might be difficult for us to look the new human population in the eyes because by then they might be facing sideways
8622851 arsenic poisoning is behind many instances of ill health in southern asia including a rising number of cancer cases developing a low cost method of decontaminating ground water that is laced with high levels of arsenic is a key challenge for sustainable agriculture there
8622852 while there are some techniques available for treating relatively small quantities of water there has until now been no viable technology available for decontaminating groundwater on a large scale that can ensure safe irrigation and potable water supply
8622853 this project developed by queens is the only method which is eco friendly easy to use and deliverable to the rural community user at an affordable cost
8622854 from its inception we have had the vital support of indian based stakeholders such as village councils and local financial institutions this has been vital as they are the authorities who monitor the water supply and distribution in rural areas and provide micro credit to the local farmers
8622855 with their help we now have a solution which is transferable to many areas in need across asia
8622856 it is beyond the accidents at bhopal india in 1984 and chernobyl ukraine in 1986
8622857 arsenic in drinking water is a major public health hazard and should be dealt with as an emergency
8622858 there have been a lot of complaints about rec procedures from researchers in recent years they often find the process onerous and bureaucratic however this study is the first time anyone has systematically analysed what recs are saying about cancer trial proposals
8622859 recs are looking for evidence that researchers are sensitive to ethical issues in particular to participants interests and that information given to potential participants explains the trial fully and truthfully researchers can improve their chances of success at ethical review by really good preparation
8622860 currently food heated in a microwave loses heat to the cold dish because the dishes are transparent to microwaves
8622861 the plates are still cool when the cooking is completed
8622862 dishes heated by themselves or with food could keep the food hot of up to 15 minutes one might even cook a pizza on a plate and then deliver it hot
8622863 we used cooking oil because it is an innocuous substance
8622864 we could perhaps use this material in a closed system to decompose organic contaminants in soil or dirt

8622896 you know republicans will even criticize the set to distract you from the issues
8622897 youre the republican candidate for president and you want to fix the countrys problems even though you dont know much about the economy you dont know how to use the internet you dont know how many houses you own or what kind of car you drive you admit you dont think clearly when you re tired you make frequent gaffes on foreign policy you think offshore drilling is a short term solution to high gas prices you support torture and keeping the guantanamo prison open you make rash decisions and statements from which you have to quickly backtrack you have an explosive temper on a hair trigger your idea of health care reform is wear more sunscreen youre for stem cell research except when its done on stem cells because you consider them all american citizens and you voted to support the policies of the worst president ever 100 percent of the time this year
8622898 no time for on the job training mccain will bring a lifetime of experience obama will bring a speech that he gave in 2002

8622900 i do believe in 2004 bush was president of the united states of america not a 1 2 term senator
8622901 wonder what mccains going to do speak from a faux prison cell really drive the pow point home
8622902 heres the thing bush could get away with it because no one was accusing him of excessive ego elitism or celebrity he was the regular schmo everyone wanted to have a beer with the columns didnt mean anything in that case but with obama hes being labeled an egomaniacal hubristic celebrity so columns reminisent of a temple should be avoided the criticism concern by some of us is fair we just dont want it to be used to further label him an elitist messiah figure
8622903 im glad to be talking tonight to the haves and the have mores

8622906 you are so right vote out the pelosi wingnut who doesnt even know nat gas is a fossil fuel and vote out the democrats in congress who are keeping this country on the wrong track time for change time for a conservative congress like the good old days of 1994

8622916 but to build a relationship we have to get russia to abide by the rules of international institutions in a way that will give it dignity
8622917 that means we mustnt lecture them with old cold war rhetoric in a morally superior way which doesnt wash any more
8622918 we dont have much of a moral stance to lecture from and they know that
8622919 ive been saying for years that the putinites believe and fear a sort of encirclement by american backed regimes this stand off between russia and georgia is something that is being stacked up by both sides for political interests and the georgians have put themselves in the middle of this
8622920 i go there often ive been instrumental in trying to get russian studies going there theres been an eradication of all the old links in the last decade but historically those links are very strong however georgia wants to turn its back on russia it will always be in the russian orbit

8622928 after carefully assessing the situation the bureau of the organising committee for the fifa world cup today decided that the preliminary competition match between georgia and the republic of ireland will take place at a neutral venue due to the current unrest in georgia
8622929 although the georgian football federation gff had hoped to host this match at home in tbilisi it will now be played in mainz germany on the originally scheduled date of september 6 2008 with georgia acting as the host association
8622930 last week fifa had asked the gff to name an alternative venue for this match in order to be prepared should the situation in georgia still require a neutral venue

8622937 nicole is really proud of this new one and they could squeeze it on
8622938 our decision to engage was made in the last second as the russian tanks were rolling we had no choice
8622939 we took the initiative just to buy some time we knew we were not going to win against the russian army but we had to do something to defend ourselves
8622940 i got a call from the minister of defense that russian tanks some 200 were massing to enter tskhinvali from north ossetia
8622941 i ignored it at first but reports kept coming in that they had begun to move forward in fact they had mobilized reserves several days ahead of time
8622942 that theyd been called up three days before from places like moscow we had intelligence coming in ahead of time but we just couldnt believe it also in recent weeks the separatists had intensified artillery barrages and were shooting our soldiers id kept telling our guys to stay calm actually we had most of our troops down near abkhazia where we expected the real trouble to start i can tell you that if wed intended to attack wed have withdrawn our best trained forces from iraq up front
8622943 some months ago i was warned by western leaders in dubrovnik to expect an attack this summer

8622946 neither i nor my vets had ever heard of the drug felbinac until we got the call about myths positive test
8622947 we were stunned and baffled we spent the entire day doing internet research on the uses for this drug and how it could possibly have gotten into my horses system as far as we could find it is not even manufactured approved or available in the u s my horse has had no soundness problems whatsoever and i would have no need for an anti inflammatory anyone who knows me knows wholeheartedly that i would never dope my horse intentionally it is cheating it is not putting your best against the others best i have never been in a more torturous and frustrating situation trying to prove innocence is very hard it saddens me beyond description that my whole reputation could be blackened because of this situation
8622948 there are circumstances in this case that makes it difficult to clear out how the prohibited substance entered into the horses system
8622949 the usef stands behind the feis initiatives to rid the sport of doping and to protect the welfare of our horses we are equally supportive of courtney in this situation as this substance was unknown to any of us until a few days ago

8623038 we categorically deny that the sudan liberation movement has carried out the hijacking we condemn any act that causes harm to any sudanese civilian
8623039 the toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible
8623040 health inequity really is a matter of life and death
8623041 but health systems will not naturally gravitate towards equity unprecedented leadership is needed that compels all actors including those beyond the health sector to examine their impact on health primary health care which integrates health in all of governments policies is the best framework for doing so
8623042 central to the commissions recommendations is creating the conditions for people to be empowered to have freedom to lead flourishing lives nowhere is lack of empowerment more obvious than in the plight of women in many parts of the world health suffers as a result following our recommendations would dramatically improve the health and life chances of billions of people
8623043 water borne diseases are not caused by a lack of antibiotics but by dirty water and by the political social and economic forces that fail to make clean water available to all heart disease is caused not by a lack of coronary care units but by lives people lead which are shaped by the environments in which they live obesity is not caused by moral failure on the part of individuals but by the excess availability of high fat and high sugar foods
8623044 we rely too much on medical interventions as a way of increasing life expectancy
8623045 a more effective way of increasing life expectancy and improving health would be for every government policy and programme to be assessed for its impact on health and health equity to make health and health equity a marker for government performance
8623046 it is wonderful to have global endorsement of the australian closing the gap campaign from the csdh established by the who the csdh sets closing the gap as a goal for the whole world and produces the evidence on how health inequities are a reflection of the way we organize society and distribute power and resources the good news from the csdh for australia is that it provides plenty of ideas on how to set an agenda that will tackle the underlying determinants of health and create a healthier australia for all of us
8623047 canada likes to brag that for seven years in a row the united nations voted us
8623048 a fairer world will be a healthier world a health service and medical interventions are just one of the factors that influence population health the growth of inequalities and the phenomena of increased injustice in health is present in low and middle income countries as well as across europe it would be a crime not to take every action possible to reduce them
8623049 the report suggests avenues for action from the local to national and global levels it has been eagerly awaited by policy makers health officials grassroot activists and their community based organizations much of the research and evidence is of particular relevance to the south east asian region where too many people struggle daily for justice and equity in health the report will inspire the region to act and develop new policies and programmes
8623050 a man should not be concerned with whether he has enough possessions but whether possessions have been equally distributed
8623051 the who commission addresses one of the major issues of our global world health inequity the reports recommendations will be perceived utilized and implemented as a major policy agenda at national and global levels the issue will increase in importance as the general public become more engaged via civil society movements and multi stakeholder involvement
8623052 according to the islamic ideology social justice became a priority when the islamic revolution materialized in iran establishing a solid primary health care network in our country not only improved our health statistics but it was an excellent vehicle to move towards health equity now through the final report of the csdh and implementing its recommendations we need to move much faster in our own country towards health equity
8623053 the commission on social determinants of health report will help african leaders adapt their national development strategies to address the challenges to health these are derived from the current systemic changes taking place in the global economy that affects heavily on the poorest segments of africas population
8623054 the primary object of development for any country and for the world as a whole is the elimination of unfreedoms that reduce and impoverish the lives of people central to human deprivation is the failure of the capability to live long and healthy lives this is much more than a medical problem it relates to handicaps that have deep social roots under michael marmots leadership this who commission has concentrated on the badly neglected causal linkages that have to be adequately understood and remedied a fuller understanding is also a call for action
8623055 the united states of america spends more on health care than any other country in the world yet it ranks 41st in terms of life expectancy new orleans and its experience with hurricane katrina illustrate why we need to target social determinants of health sdh including housing education working and learning conditions and whether people are exposed to toxins better than any place i can think of right now by targeting the sdh we can rapidly move towards closing the gap that unfairly and avoidably separates the health status of groups of different socio economic status social exclusion experience and educational background
8623056 health delivery is not possible for people living in squalor in dehumanizing pathetic conditions prevailing in the ever growing slum settlements of cities and towns in developing countries investment in basic services such as water and education will always remain constrained if not wasted unless accompanied by requisite investment in decent housing with basic sanitation
8623057 countries of the world are presently growing apart in health terms this is very worrying in many countries in the world social differences in health are also growing and this is true in europe we have been one sidedly focused on economic growth disregarding negative consequences for health and climate we need to think differently about development
8623058 what this report makes clear is that improving health and health outcomes and reducing avoidable health differences goals of all countries involves far more than just improving the health care system basic living conditions employment early childhood education treatment of women and poverty all impact on health outcomes and incorporating their effects on health outcomes needs to become an important part of public policymaking this is as true for wealthy countries like the united states as it is for many of the emerging countries of the world where large numbers of people live on less than 2 per day

8623064 you will be killing the talks once you form a government forget about talks it is a disaster and an act of insanity to think that mugabe can go it alone
8623065 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently
8623066 this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse i do not know when that day will come i wish tsvangirai well on that day

8623088 no podemos permitirnos el lujo de que los temas importantes no se lleven a cabo en esta legislatura partiendo de la base de que las cuentas de 2009 son muy importantes estamos en mitad de legislatura y los proyectos prioritarios deben ponerse en marcha el a o que viene

8623101 russia is one of the hardest fought luxury markets in the world
8623102 since customers are not so far along in their purchasing decision you can change their opinion very quickly with the right marketing
8623103 there is another big difference about our customers they are considerably younger our average mercedes buyer is between 35 37 years of age in other words roughly 15 years younger than elsewhere
8623104 it would be fatal not to be present at this show the effect you can generate in russia during such a trade fair is much higher than in an established market
8623105 a manufacturing site only makes sense for more than 100 000 vehicles and we are far away from those kinds of volumes ckd is another question but we examined this option and decided against it for now

8623109 the sco states express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the south ossetian issue and urges the sides to solve existing problems peacefully through dialogue and to make efforts facilitating reconciliation and talks
8623110 the presidents reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of respect for historic and cultural traditions of every country and efforts aimed at preserving the unity of a state and its territorial integrity
8623111 placing the emphasis exclusively on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a comprehensive settlement of local conflicts
8623112 i am sure that the united position of the sco member states will have international resonance
8623113 and i hope it will serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white and justify this aggression
8623114 we understand the complex history and realities of south ossetia and abkhazia

8623155 members have indicated clearly that they are not prepared to accept below inflation pay or a repeat of last years ten month delay staff are feeling betrayed and management and the government need to act quickly in order to avoid embarrassing industrial action in acas
8623156 with the government losing the goodwill of the people who deliver the everyday things we take for granted there is a rapid need for it to rethink its approach to public sector pay
8623157 the governments policy of driving down wages with pay offers way below inflation is hitting people on low incomes and entrenching pay inequality in the civil service
8623158 it is scandalous that the dvlas predominantly female workforce should be underpaid to the tune of 17 5 million a year when compared to colleagues elsewhere in the dft this latest stoppage shows that low paid hardworking civil servants arent prepared to let pay inequality go unchecked or endure pay cuts

8623165 once tom was taken off the line he was washed fed and given water and put in safe keeping until we found his owner
8623166 we are all pleased tom survived and the fact that the tortoise belongs to ruth jones is something else
8623167 i would like to thank all of the staff at the recycling depot at lamby way for saving tom we really thought we had lost him and the family is relieved to have him back home
8623168 this is an exciting time for seos we are going through a period of sustained growth and we needed a facility that could meet our requirements both now and into the future i am looking forward to the challenge of supplying and supporting our customers with their display needs from orlando

8623174 for money laundering to be proven you have to show it was the product of a crime but we dont have any evidence for a crime committed in pakistan
8623175 it would be very difficult to say that there is nothing in the files that shows there was possibly corruption going on after what i have seen in there
8623176 after i heard what the general prosecutor said i have the feeling we are talking about two different cases
8623177 the van was carrying policemen and jail staff when it was hit by an explosives laden car which was used in the attack
8623178 thats the way things come clear all of a sudden and then you realize how obvious theyve been all along
8623179 this is a startling amount of change in a major area of peoples lives over a very short period
8623180 we have been going at top speed up to now

8623193 iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 and that the program remains frozen
8623194 the hands of a terrorist organization or an unauthorized state
8623195 the wider nuclear network has been monitored for many years by a joint anglo american intelligence effort but rather than shut it down investigations by law enforcement bodies such as the fbi and britains revenue amp customs have been aborted to preserve diplomatic relations
8623196 not named since obviously our officials are ashamed of admitting to these relations
8623197 could be used in manufacturing enough enriched uranium to produce 7 nuclear weapons a year
8623198 im not supporting turkeys nuclear energy program anymore because im not clear about what the real intention is lets put it that way
8623199 that the consignment from turkish businessman gunes cire to libya was
8623200 arrived in libya without any obstruction and this is unusual
8623201 the way that fontaines relative in the secret service is being committed is sad because shes almost as good as trev
8623202 the pranks and lies being played on ballard arent fair but war and love arent either i wish he knew that as a man at war at one point in his life
8623203 he ended a war over those women china should want him lets go to war lets kill a bunch of people over stolen jewelry
8623204 the cpi m does not want india to go for the nuclear deal but they do not have any objection to china going for the deal can they not be called agents
8623205 the cpi m has opposed india signing the gatt treaty and inclusion in the wto now even china has entered wto and wants most favoured nation status from the us
8623206 does the deal mean that we cannot make nuclear bombs the answer is we can
8623207 they spend a lot of time commuting or working and we would like to use that dead time to enable them to access services such as this one
8623208 we want to tap into the smaller towns and cities where our customers may not have access to the internet but can upload profiles using a preloaded application
8623209 of course the parents want to be involved in the process but they are also open to using newer platforms such as mobiles to scout for their soul mate

8623211 we and ericsson are always discussing ways of making sony ericsson as successful as it possibly can be

8623220 when you put that ethanol in here it eats up the insides or rusts them out
8623221 all the rubber gaskets and parts it eats those up
8623222 tests completed on lawnmowers chainsaws weed trimmers and blower vacs with ethanol fuels showed no engine failures no unscheduled maintenance and good performance
8623223 the alcohol actually dissipates the oil so on a two cycle engine youre lubricating the engine but the oil is being pushed away so its actually not lubricating the engine

8623225 prior studies have indicated reduced bone density in hiv infected patients but little was known whether fracture risk increased in this population
8623226 these data are the first to suggest that there is a clinically significant increase in bone fractures among hiv infected patients using data from a large healthcare system
8623227 recent estimates indicate that if trends continue the way they are developing countries will face a 75 increase in the number of cervical cancer cases because of growth and aging of the population in the next two decades but it doesnt have to turn out that way
8623228 the discovery of hpv as the cause of cervical cancer has shaken a field that was stagnating and we are now in a new era where developing countries no longer have to be left behind
8623229 efforts are needed now to adapt the current price of the vaccines so they meet what individual countries can afford the solution may be tiered pricing according to gross national income per capita and according to the scale of country efforts
8623230 the models provide a useful roadmap for testing promising strategies in the field more research is needed to determine an efficient combination of these new approaches and each country will have to decide which is best for them but we are confident we have provided a valuable starting point for going forward
8623231 this new era of cervical cancer presents many opportunities and challenges ahead there is now realistic hope for controlling this disease where the toll is the highest and we have to seize this opportunity we in the cervical cancer community will be stepping up all our efforts to help developing countries get this disease under control
8623232 two thirds of adverse events after a heart attack which may be a further heart attack stroke or major bleed happen after a patient has been discharged from hospital
8623233 our findings are of concern because we believe that the risk for patients whose heart attack was originally considered not as severe may be being misjudged

8623247 our relationship with the baltimore police department is in peril we need to know who they are and they need to know who we are
8623248 this is one experimental case that is indicative but there are many others
8623249 there is the possibility of creating designer drugs with this newly discovered information
8623250 these are models that conform to the point of view that the structures have been designed to exert very strong control of their motions
8623251 those motions correspond closely to the motions needed for their function
8623252 we need to make sure our prevention messages are comprehensive
8623253 in addition to talking about avoiding transmission health communication efforts should promote testing as well
8623254 one of the best ways to find college students is on facebook since thats where they meet and interact with each other
8623255 we found that two thirds of our participants were recruited online either through facebook or through e mail
8623256 studies show that if you have higher perceived knowledge you tend to be tested more
8623257 and that may partially contribute to the higher testing observed among black students in the study
8623258 they are completely beside themselves he is terrified by the prospect of going to

8623265 i am extremely grateful to the airlines for agreeing with the vfw that dropping the fee was the right decision to make for our troops
8623266 a 100 is a huge out of pocket expense to someone who doesnt earn very much
8623267 and thats why this luggage fee waiver is so important our troops can now properly focus on their mission instead of remembering to complete a travel voucher in a war zone
8623268 ive always admired him and hes certainly been a target of mine since i came to the football club
8623269 to actually secure the deal and bring shaun back home is a fantastic coup for us and im sure the supporters will be just as excited as we are to have him back at manchester city
8623270 who they choose as their president is the americans business
8623271 but its the business of iraqis to say what they want and thats where the people and the government are in general agreement the tenure of the coalition troops in iraq should be limited
8623272 a general time horizon for meeting aspirational goals such as the resumption of iraqi security control in their cities and provinces and the further reduction of u s combat forces from iraq
8623273 youve heard the ideological argument to keep u s forces in the middle east ive heard it from the hawks they say keep united states military presence in the middle east like we have with the 7th fleet in asia we have the german the south korean component do you think we could get along without it
8623274 i not only think we could get along without it but i think one of our big problems has been the fact that many iraqis resent american military presence
8623275 and i dont pretend to know exactly iraqi public opinion but as soon as we can reduce our visibility as much as possible the better i think it is going to be
8623276 he suggested that powell armitage franks former iraq viceroy jerry bremer and even feiths old boss donald rumsfeld should be blamed for the postwar chaos in iraq not him
8623277 evidence that was uncovered and analyzed attests to the existence of a terrorist capability and a willingness to use it until the day saddam was forced to flee baghdad by coalition forces
8623278 hussein had the capability and intention of striking u s with terror attacks
8623279 the alliance between the baathists and jihadists which sustains al qaeda in is not new contrary to what you may have been told i know this firsthand some of my friends were murdered by jihadists by al qaeda affiliated operatives who had been sheltered and assisted by saddams regime in 2002 envoys of the patriotic union of kurdistan one of the two kurdish parties sharing sovereignty over northern iraq between the two iraq wars presented the cia with evidence that the organization that tried to kill mr salih had been in part funded and directed by saddam husseins republican guard salih confirmed that there were links between ansar al islam and al qaeda the information at time in 2002 was quite different now we could not prove this in a court of law but this is intelligence
8623280 it will not necessarily implicate the regime in supporting al qaeda
8623281 the rise of islamist fundamentalism in the region gave saddam the opportunity to make terrorism one of the few tools remaining in saddams
8623282 saddam supported groups that either associated directly with al qaeda such as the egyptian islamic jihad led at one time by bin ladens deputy ayman al zawahiri or that generally shared al qaedas stated goals and objectives
8623283 this study found no smoking gun i e sirect connection between saddams iraq and al qaeda
8623284 was the first official acknowledgment from the us military that there was no evidence saddam had ties to al qaeda
8623285 saddam supported groups that either associated directly with al qaeda such as the egyptian islamic jihad led at one time by bin ladens deputy ayman al zawahiri or that generally shared al qaedas stated goals and objectives
8623286 neuroscience yes we do think while we are asleep and we solve problems too
8623287 obviously im delighted to come back to city and i just cant wait to get started again
8623288 ive always admired him and hes certainly been a target of mine since i came to the football club

8623290 alive and screaming protest music endures in the ipod era
8623291 why are they working so late its after 8 oclock
8623292 how could i you shot me first remember too bad you skipped town without waiting to see what happened next
8623293 it hurts like hell not as bad as seeing you in bed with that guy but bad just the same
8623294 yeah well that guy was a millionaire jewel dealer named al jazari who was about to tell me where he kept his personal diamond collection when you came in and took the sparkle from his eyes permanently i figure you owe me
8623295 im glad you didnt die sorry i shot you im a hot head you know that plus im still crazy for you even after all this
8623296 fine just dont do it again al meant nothing to me in fact he even looked a little like you so i pretended he was then you put a bullet in his face
8623297 some say i havent got a heart perhaps theyre right
8623298 nah ive missed you in fact i was just thinking of old times when you blasted me
8623299 sure doll and i was wishing i hadnt shot you

8623301 deal and no more screwing around even for diamonds okay
8623302 the bleeding seems to have stopped what should i do
8623303 you have the opposite of poker face you have like miniature golf face travel is worth any cost or sacrifice i am loyal and constant in my love for travel as i have not always been loyal and constant in my other loves i feel about travel the way a happy new mother feels about her impossible colicky restless newborn baby i just dont care what it puts me through because i adore it because its mine because it looks exactly like me it can barf all over me if it wants to i just dont care when you are lost in those woods it sometimes takes you a while to realize that you are lost for the longest time you can convince yourself that youve just wandered a few feet off the path that youll find your way back to the trailhead any moment now then night falls again and again and you still have no idea where you are and its time to admit that you have bewildered yourself so far off the path that you dont even know from which direction the sun rises anymore ive been screwed and sued and tattooed and im still standing here in front of you im exhausted by the cumulative consequences of a lifetime of hasty choices and chaotic passions it is better to live your own destiny imperfectly than to live an imitation of somebody elses life with perfection so no i have started living my own life imperfect and clumsy as it may look it is resembling me now thoroughly the yogic path is about disentangling the built in glitches of the human condition which im going to over simply define here as the heartbreaking inability to sustain contentment just as there exists in writing a literal truth and a poetic truth there also exists in a human being a literal anatomy and a poetic anatomy one you can see one you cannot one is made of bones and teeth and flesh the other is made of energy and memory and faith but they are both equally true people think a soul mate is your perfect fit and thats what everyone wants but a true soul mate is a mirror the person who shows you everything that is holding you back the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life a true soul mate is probably the most important person you will ever meet because they tear down your walls and smack you awake but to live with a soul mate forever nah too painful soul mates they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you and then they leave and thank god for it you gotta stop wearing your wishbone where your backbone outta be my hypersensitive awareness of times speed led me to push myself to experience life at a maximum pace if i were going to have such a short visit on earth i had to do everything possible to experience it now hence all the traveling all the romances all the ambition and all the pasta you gotta let go and sit still and allow contentment to come to you there are only two questions that human beings have ever fought over all through history how much do you love me and whos in charge everything else is somehow manageable but theses two questions of love and control undo us all trip us up and cause war grief and suffering you cannot see your reflection in running water only in still water in the search for god you revert from what attracts you and swim toward that which is difficult you abandon your comforting and familiar habits with the hope that something greater will be offered you in return for what youve given up devo farmi le ossa italian for i need to make bones i need to do it for my strength guilt is just your egos way of tricking you into thinking that youre making moral progress we do spiritual ceremonies as human beings in order to create a safe resting place for our most complicated feelings of joy or trauma so that we dont have to haul those feelings around with us forever weighing us down we all need such places of ritual safekeeping sometimes the best way to get over someone is to get under someone else sanskrit word antevasin one who lives on the border it indicated a person who had left the busting center of worldly life to go live at the edge of the forest where the spiritual masters dwelled the antevasin was not one of the villagers anymore not a householder with a conventional life but neither was he yet a transcendent not one of those sages who live deep in the unexpected woods fully realized the antevasin was an in betweener he was a border dweller he lived in sight of both worlds but he looked toward the unknown and he was a scholar
8623304 it until one is committed there is hesitancy the chance to draw back always ineffectiveness concerning all acts of initiative there is one elementary truth the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans that the moment one definitely commits oneself then providence moves too all sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred a whole stream of events issues from the decision raising in ones favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man would have dreamt would have come his way
8623305 i make progress by having people around me who are smarter than i am and listening to them and i assume that everyone is smarter about something than i am
8623306 a person should never be ashamed to own that he has been in the wrong which is but saying that he is wiser today than he was yesterday
8623307 to have a great adventure and survive requires good judgment good judgment comes from experience experience of course is the result of poor judgment
8623308 the true test of character is not how much we know how to do but how we behave when we dont know what to do
8623309 the thing to remember when traveling is that the trail is the thing not the end of the trail travel too fast and you miss all that you are traveling for
8623310 everything i did in my life that was worthwhile i caught hell for
8623311 you need to understand the rules so you can break them intelligently
8623312 the true test of being comfortable with someone else is the ability to share silence
8623313 live each day as you would climb a mountain an occasional glance towards the summit puts the goal in mind many beautiful scenes can be observed from each new vantage point climb steadily slowly enjoy each passing moment and the view from the summitt will serve as a fitting climax to the journey
8623314 it is not your religion if you only do it in church
8623315 to laugh is to risk appearing the fool to weep is to risk appearing sentimental to reach out for another is to risk involvement to expose feelings is to risk exposing your true self to place your ideas your dreams before the crowds is to risk their loss to love is to risk not being loved in return to live is to risk dying to hope is to risk despair to try is to risk failure but risks must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing the person who risks nothing does nothing has nothing is nothing he may avoid suffering and sorrow but he simply cannot learn feel change grow love live chained by his certitudes he is a slave he has forfeited freedom only a person who risks is free
8623316 you can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who can do nothing for them or to them
8623317 comradeship regardless of race or creed is forged among high mountains through the difficulties and dangers to which they expose those who aspire to climb them the need to combine the efforts to attain their goal the thrills of a great adventure shared together
8623318 one should not go into churches if one wants to breathe pure air
8623319 i believe that no man can be completely able to summon all his strength his will all his energy for the last desperate move till he is convinced the last bridge is down behind him and that there is nowhere to go but on
8623320 looking back on those wild free days in the open i realize that my happiest memories are of the suntanned faces of my old companions
8623321 what we get from this adventure is just sheer joy and joy is after all the end of life we do not live to eat and make money we eat and make money to be able to enjoy life that is what life means and what life is for
8623322 open the door there is magic under the teapot in your shoestring and the wind outside chanting to you
8623323 there is nothing in this world that i am prouder of than my ability to feel to survive and yes to be a fool for what i love and believe in
8623324 the only justification we have to look down on someone is because we are about to pick him up
8623325 you cant stay in your corner of the forest waiting for others to come to you you have to go to them sometimes

8623555 at this point my husband managed to get to his feet and the man hit him again
8623556 this was a terrifying experience for my family especially for our eldest daughter who has talked of nothing else and has been waking in the night screaming about the nasty man who hit her daddy

8623574 the concerns i have regarding this group are the same as those i have about much larger groups such as the moonies
8623575 some of the allegations go back some time and some go back to a couple of years ago
8623576 we contacted bangor university and the people we spoke to gave us no reason to be concerned
8623577 there is a reasonable small residential community scattered in the school and none of those people said they were concerned at anything the group was doing

8623587 i managed to get them to hold onto the board
8623588 with the current flowing and some pretty big waves breaking over their heads they were panicking they couldnt go left or right or get back to shore
8623589 we were all kicking as hard as we could to get free of the currents
8623590 i was in the right place at the right time someone just needed to get a board out to them to give them something to hold on to
8623591 i think they would have been in real trouble without a board
8623592 we were standing with the mother of one of the children and had to stop her from going into the water
8623593 we were just watching it all unfold knowing that we couldnt go in because wed be risking out own lives it was just surreal really watching people almost drown and not being able to do anything
8623594 at one stage one of the kids let go of the board and tried swimming in they were taking in a lot of water on the board they were out for about 15 minutes but it felt like a very long time it was awful

8623643 studies show that if you have higher perceived knowledge you tend to be tested more

8623682 since february 5 she clinton secured fewer than 40 superdelegate endorsements 40 no matter what the polls said or what her margins of victory were in ohio or pennsylvania or west virginia the party leaders would not allow themselves to be swayed away from obama perhaps the clinton hold on the party was gone a lot sooner than some of us in the media realized these folks were simply looking for an excuse to dump the clintons

8623687 when you think of najib to be the next prime minister you will immediately think of mongolian then you will be shivering
8623688 with the federal government not investing not setting good regulatory mechanisms and basically taking a back seat on everything except drilling and fossil fuels the grid has not been modernized especially for wind energy
8623689 i dont think we can go on very much longer without knowing how things are going to unfold
8623690 i would like this all to possibly be resolved within the next couple of weeks
8623691 were certainly not expecting anything next week and i think its unlikely that anything will be announced the following week either
8623692 were keen to come to an agreement on a deal with edf although whether thats achieved is still open to debate
8623693 i dont think well come to a conclusion in the next week or even in two weeks
8623694 wed like it to be concluded as soon as possible but its very hard to put a timeline on it it could run into october
8623695 the council discussed the details that have been circulated in the convention was a series of recommendations
8623696 the provincial council elections must take place this year because the non disclosure procedure on the boards cover the current and become illegal and we laredo political and legal problems
8623697 the iraqi government wants to see more clearly by the american side on the iraqi american convention especially in the absence of any foreign soldier later in 2011
8623698 there are cases pending in the convention including jurisdiction because the government wanted clarification on these matters
8623699 dream as if youll live forever live as if youll die today
8623700 was making some recommendations and guidance will be reflected on the negotiating team
8623701 flexibility and responsiveness of the parties to reach an agreement that we can adopt and approved by the parliament
8623702 dream as if youll live forever live as if youll die today
8623703 we see quite a few children with back pain and many of them contribute their backpain to heavy book bags
8623704 i put backpack use into the sorta over use injury category in other words you have a child who is doing something that is over using or over stressing their body
8623705 check that back pack on a regular basis and have a backpack that brings the weight as close the body as possible

8623710 i dont think either paper sun times or chicago tribune is going to survive

8623713 our nation to a new era of peace and broadly shared prosperity
8623714 i dont want to talk about this anymore lets move on to something else
8623715 working people in silicon valley are walking an economic tightrope and any unexpected medical bill or even a car breakdown can push them over the edge
8623716 this report does an excellent job documenting what people outside the region have been slow to understand that silicon valley is a fairly brutal environment
8623717 our performance on the global stage doesnt necessarily translate into regional prosperity the kind that is widely shared so you get this troubling picture where our companies are thriving but the region feels worse off
8623718 the bay area council has seen increasing evidence that an increasing wage disparity is putting the region at significant risk
8623719 the sustainability of the economy depends on people at all levels being able to live and work here
8623720 can we apply the same spirit of innovation to social and economic policy and public policy
8623721 maybe one day i could afford to buy a condo
8623722 the obama campaign is the broadband campaign and the mccain campaign is the dial up campaign
8623723 on mccains watch the u s fell from third to fifteenth in broadband penetration
8623724 you know in your hearts that in eight years there was never one conversation in the oval office between dick cheney and george bush on broadband policy
8623725 four years ago president bush announced that it was his administrations goal to have universal broadband by 2007
8623726 its not a total naivet that people say in campaigns that they arent able to deliver on but i was cautiously optimistic that there was territory we could bridge
8623727 never really made achieving their goal a serious matter for them
8623728 deploying broadband is really hard work but it is the critical foundation for achieving in my judgment all of our laudable goals
8623729 part of the culture change in my view is to start with a very customer friendly point of view
8623730 i dont think that exists right now budgets have to change people have to change and expertise has to be added to the process
8623731 security issues no we solved that in the airline industry with printable boarding passes this is not something that cant be done its something we havent thought about
8623732 if there is a prolonged lag in investment and if the liquidity environment continues to be constrictive then it is concerning for the venture capital industry
8623733 as i look for deals and talk to people i have never seen a time in europe when there are so many good young companies being started
8623734 there is a lot of innovation in the energy sector right now and investors are trying to educate themselves on the types of companies out there before investing in everything
8623735 i dont know if google apps is ready for primetime yet
8623736 google has to come up with something significantly cheaper and better than office

8623738 am i nervous to host corporate information on someone elses server yes even if its google
8623739 its all about working in teams sharing information and working across company boundaries google apps is designed around this new paradigm

8623748 he is after all a big blue grave full of tang
8623749 lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8623750 dont like last minute so we sort of got our speech together about a month ago actually got to sort of live with it so those were my words so it was very easy for me to internalize it amazingly getting up in front of a crowd is probably the easiest part of it after 19 months of hanging out with barack obama with 75 000 people could be at a time you get used to the energy of the crowd and i tend to feed off of that and i try to stay focused on why im there and that can fill my spirit with the kind of authenticity i think i just try to let people get a sense of the real me as much as possible so i just try to let go and speak from the heart

8623755 we have commissioned kpmg to do a report on the equestrian shooting and basketball venues looking at whether the olympic experience and the legacy they will provide represents value for money
8623756 when you take the costs for these venues it seems like a lot of money to a lot of people it is a sort of testing to destruction to see whether that spending can be justified

8623781 teamwork dedication and commitment from the members of the ontario agd has lead to this great achievement
8623782 we look forward to another outstanding year in which we can help advance the field of dentistry and the agd as well as ensure the oral health of the public
8623783 studies show primary aldosteronism may be more prevalent than previously thought affecting more than ten percent of hypertensive patients
8623784 the new guideline uses the best available research to help physicians diagnose primary aldosteronism and employ specific treatments that can alleviate the impact of this condition
8623785 we would never claim that what we study in mice directly relates to how antidepressants work in humans but there are interesting features in parallel
8623786 the study unifies different observations that point to the brains dentate gyrus region and to creation of nerve cells as being important in depression
8623787 at least in mice this result directly links antidepressants and voluntary exercise with trkb mediated creation of nerve cells
8623788 we can get biochemical physiological behavioral and anatomical results in animal models
8623789 these all resonate with the human condition so perhaps you have a physiological relevancy potential new targets for antidepressant medications
8623790 patients who used statins before an ami and continued to take them after were 16 less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your ami it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8623791 in the general population the statin discontinuation rate within the first year of prescription is 30 percent thats very high
8623792 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami
8623793 anoles are highly visual species so in that sense its not surprising that they would use visual displays to mark territory
8623794 still the finding is surprising because these are the first animals known to use non acoustic signaling at dawn and dusk
8623795 these patterns have remarkable parallels with the dawn and dusk choruses reported for many acoustically communicating animals
8623796 the dawn chorus may be a way of communicating having survived the night
8623797 if in the morning a bird doesnt hear its neighbor or an anole doesnt see its neighbor it may be an opportunity for the animal to expand its territory
8623798 as in humans if an anole can do many of these push ups it shows that he is in prime physical condition these displays of strength help avert actual physical confrontations between male lizards which can be very fierce and destructive
8623799 the association between magnesium sulfate and a lower incidence of cerebral palsy has biologic plausibility because magnesium stabilizes blood vessels protects against damage from oxygen depletion and protects against injury from swelling and inflammation all of which threaten the vulnerable preterm brain
8623800 our study is the largest most comprehensive effort to evaluate the effect of magnesium sulfate on the incidence of cerebral palsy in preterm infants
8623801 our finding that magnesium sulfate protects against cerebral palsy is consistent with two previous randomized trials both of which were well done and which in total enrolled over 1 600 women our trial and the two others show that magnesium sulfate can reduce the risk of this devastating condition in preterm infants until we can prevent early preterm birth the best that we obstetricians can do is to improve the prospects for infants who are born very early i think that our study says that magnesium sulfate can help us do that
8623802 the resident spaz invisible as the sign that says no running the one no one pays attention to
8623803 eighty per cent of bone mass is accrued in the first 20 years and especially around puberty due to the circulating hormones this study targets a window of opportunity in adolescence to maximise peak bone mass with high intensity weight bearing activity
8623804 peak height velocity is at different ages in boys and girls most boys in the group were right at that stage while most girls in the study were past puberty
8623805 weve made movies to show this traffic jam as a function of energy at some energies the traffic is moving and at others the electron traffic is completely blocked
8623806 it has been a frustrating and embarrassing problem to explain why this is the case
8623807 its like taking some cars off the highway during rush hour all of a sudden the traffic starts to move
8623808 in essence the research shows that what is believed to be required to increase the superconductivity in these systems stronger magnetic interactions also pushes the system closer to the quantum traffic jam status where lack of holes locks the electrons into positions from which they cannot move its like gassing up the cars and then jamming them all onto the highway at once theres lots of energy but no ability to go anywhere
8623809 we need to look for materials with such strong pairing but which dont exhibit this mottness or quantum traffic jam effect
8623810 our hope is that they will have less traffic jam effect while having stronger electron pairing
8623811 in the future we can look at these and other factors in women who quit smoking during pregnancy to assess who is at low or high risk of relapse
8623812 we can then offer more intensive interventions for those at higher risk to address the physical behavioral and social issues related to relapse
8623813 but more needs to be done because over 50 percent of women who quit the habit during pregnancy are smoking again at six months postpartum
8623814 many of the women who relapsed were already trying to quit again when we interviewed them
8623815 while there is no simple solution we recommend directly addressing the social and financial stresses that lead to relapse we hope that our study will encourage creative interventions to help mothers sustain a smoke free lifestyle after pregnancy improving overall health for women and their families
8623816 often patients with these radiologic findings are referred for eus in lieu of waiting for repeated imaging our study looked to determine the performance characteristics of eus and or eus with fna in diagnosing a pancreatic tumor in this patient population
8623817 we found that eus and or an eus fna for diagnosing a pancreatic neoplasm was 99 1 percent accurate with 88 8 percent sensitivity and 100 percent specificity
8623818 we cannot change the cards we are dealt just how we play the hand
8623819 because seat belts can reduce the risk of injury and death in crashes by more than 50 there is a critical need for interventions to increase seat belt use by teens as both drivers and passengers
8623820 this research reinforces why state farm is actively involved in advocating for laws that help prevent injuries and deaths resulting from motor vehicle crashes its clear from these findings that primary seat belt laws for all occupants would help us accomplish that goal
8623821 prior studies have indicated reduced bone density in hiv infected patients but little was known whether fracture risk increased in this population
8623822 these data are the first to suggest that there is a clinically significant increase in bone fractures among hiv infected patients using data from a large healthcare system
8623823 we need to make sure our prevention messages are comprehensive
8623824 in addition to talking about avoiding transmission health communication efforts should promote testing as well
8623825 one of the best ways to find college students is on facebook since thats where they meet and interact with each other
8623826 we found that two thirds of our participants were recruited online either through facebook or through e mail
8623827 we dont know how many people have this pms2 variant
8623828 we would like to take these findings to human tumor samples if we could find out which individuals carry this variant it might change our decisions about treating them with cisplatin
8623829 yellowstone is located atop of one of the few large volcanic hotspots on earth
8623830 but though the hot material is a volcanic plume its cooler than others of its kind such as one in hawaii
8623831 although yellowstone sits above a plume of hot material coming up from deep with the earth its a remarkably lukewarm plume
8623832 it would be a mistake to write off yellowstone as a dead volcano a hot plume even a slightly cooler one is still hot
8623833 there are several very good guidebooks to the trails of yellowstone
8623834 sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me
8623835 the evolution of the cerebral cortex certainly improved the ability of human beings to create and adapt to function in and with groups communities and culture and to respond to pain associated with social interactions
8623836 however the cerebral cortex may also have had an unintended effect of allowing humans to relive re experience and suffer from social pain
8623837 other researchers have suggested in the past that nk cells might not always be good for you but we now have the first direct evidence that this can actually be the case although we have worked on an infectious disease the same is likely to be true for nk cells in cancer so in practical terms it means that we need to consider more carefully exactly how we use therapies that affect nk cells to maximize their beneficial role
8623838 this is one experimental case that is indicative but there are many others
8623839 there is the possibility of creating designer drugs with this newly discovered information
8623840 these are models that conform to the point of view that the structures have been designed to exert very strong control of their motions
8623841 those motions correspond closely to the motions needed for their function
8623842 this has been a summer that many retailers would rather forget
8623843 the downturn in the housing market is continuing to depress sales for those shops selling big ticket items

8623853 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8623854 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8623855 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8623856 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8623857 we expect to see that kind of thing in myanmar not on the streets of denver
8623858 the denver police department is committed to looking into each and every allegation of unnecessary force
8623859 one instance with the media shouldnt paint the entire event
8623860 i think what sen obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas
8623861 i think im more in touch with the american people as far as my policies my proposals and my ideas
8623862 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8623863 my goodness its amazing that were three days into the democratic convention and 60 or so days from the actual election and theyre still trying to plead with the american people and convince us that barack obama is ready to be president
8623864 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8623865 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8623866 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8623867 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8623868 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8623869 im little and delicate and i need it but this was the meaning i gleaned from it
8623870 huh funny how it was fine to you last week but suddenly now theres a problem
8623871 today i got up had a shower and decided to go to the store for potatoes not much else to write today
8623872 so we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8623873 on the one hand obama is expected to give one of the best speeches in american history so expectations are enormously high there will be 75 000 people an unprecedented number in attendance cheering him on but because of the attacks on obama as just another celebrity if it looks too much like a rock concert obama could actually be penalized for doing well he could also be penalized if the speech does not meet the skyrocketing expectations for another gettysburg address
8623874 well he probably cannot do what he really would like to do which is make people comfortable about him about his foreign policy experience about the direction of change that he wants to bring and i think that will take time
8623875 what he realistically can do is impress people remind them those who do not know him how articulate he is how sharp is what a great motivator he is and generally get good reviews
8623876 i have been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abysmal failure america cannot afford four more years of this failure
8623877 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8623878 we are extremely excited to hire this visionary jack of all trades to run the premier radio station in buganda

8623903 waarom gebruiken we geweld waarom gebruiken we het vaak als een grap als oliver hardy zijn bolhoed afneemt om stan laurel een dreun te verkopen dan is dat grappig maar waarom zij weten het niet wij weten het ook niet
8623904 ik heb het gevoel dat uw personages niet zozeer komisch zijn als ze geweld gebruiken maar dat het geweld hoort bij de uitzichtloosheid van hun situatie
8623905 george clooney speelt een marshall die er de hele film prat op gaat dat hij in twintig jaar dienst nog nooit heeft geschoten hij ziet brad pitt in zijn kast staan en schiet hem pardoes overhoop dat heeft niks met de uitzichtloosheid van zijn situatie te maken dat is deel van een goed opgezette grap en als je in het publiek in slaap aan het vallen was ben je nu wakker
8623906 george clooney die brad pitt neerschiet als dat niet grappig is wat dan wel
8623907 mijn vrouw las het script en zei me dit is een triest triest triest verhaal hahaha

8623910 i think what is really important for us more than anything else is that were allowed to create great games grown in the way we want to grow and maintain our culture
8623911 is the city of greensboro and guilford county dealing with folks that simply did not pay attention when the planning for the loop previously known as painter boulevard was taking place or do you think these folks were duped what ever happened to the p boulevard name did the road end up being larger in scale than it was supposed to be is there an estimate of the number of folks this road has negatively affected thanks for any insight you may offer
8623912 i am concerned that the people living close to the urban loop be treated fairly state and federal regulations govern what ncdot can do with regard to noise walls landscaping and compensation for damage due to road construction the state is in the process of reevaluating all citizen concerns and should have a report by the end of september the city of greensboro has agreed to supplement the states landscaping program along the loop and will look at its options after the states plan is finished i do believe that the road project has been an interstate highway since its inception and the noise associated with fast moving traffic on large roads is considerable while all of the homes along the highway are bearing a burden of the increased noise i am particularly concerned about the homes built before the 1996 date of notice of the road project as i indicated in my comments at the mpo meeting the city is not the lead organization in building the urban loop but we have an obligation to our citizens to make sure their concerns are heard by the appropriate agency and that they are given answers to their questions
8623913 ze praatte zichzelf de put in cramer is een heel aardig mens maar een politieke brekebeen
8623914 ze vindt dat wij op n lijn zitten en ik haar moet steunen ze heeft in het kabinet keihard geknokt om honderd procent binnen te halen het werd tien procent maar als parlementari r wil ik die honderd procent
8623915 een politicus laat zich nooit overtuigen en zegt nooit dat hij iets niet weet want dat zijn tekenen van zwakte in de wetenschap is het andersom
8623916 ik was meer de natuurliefhebber zij was meer bezig met grote systematische kwesties
8623917 bij hoorcolleges ging het er emotioneel aan toe het waren manifestaties waarbij je in debat moest met je studenten over noord zuidverhoudingen altijd wierp zich een woordvoerder op en je hoopte maar dat het geen domkop was want daar zat je dan een jaar aan vast jacqueline was gelukkig heel slim en scherp
8623918 iemand van het college van bestuur belde me loet er is een bezetting bij biologie op annas hoeve de studenten willen de benoeming van ene jacqueline cramer ik zei meteen doen
8623919 in de jaren zeventig ontstond een netwerk van mensen die afknapten op de harde wetenschap ze zijn nu vijftig zestig jaar oud en bekleden in het milieubeleid strategische posities topambtenaren adviesbureaus het is een heel hecht netwerk
8623920 maar ze bleef altijd een nette academische dame kon met mes en vork eten en op hoge hakken lopen dat gold niet voor iedereen in de milieubeweging dat was een sfeer van harige kabouters en eitjes eten in het park
8623921 als zij haar huis schildert doet ze dat met verf op waterbasis als haar koffiezetapparaat kapot is zal ze het proberen te repareren verspilling komt niet voor in haar woordenboek een auto heeft ze nooit gehad
8623922 het was een gideonsbende van 25 30 man door de buitenwereld weggehoond als geitenwollen sokken vegetari rs
8623923 alle partijen zochten koortsachtig experts jacqueline moest met jan en alleman om tafel advies geven programmas schrijven in commissies zo belandde ze in de polder
8623924 we wilden een fris gezicht een buitenstaander en cramer was erg bindend
8623925 ze had gezag en idee n ze leek ons ideaal
8623926 ze vroeg zich af of ze geschikt was voor het politieke spel hoewel het lokte
8623927 ze weifelde over een overstap kon ze wat klaarspelen als al die kanonnen op haar gericht stonden
8623928 onze zoon en dochter zaten in de laatste jaren van de lagere school een cruciale fase
8623929 maar je weet niet hoe de economie er dan voorstaat bovendien is dit kabinet dan feitelijk uitgeregeerd
8623930 maar heeft zij de bestuurskracht om straks de echt moeilijke besluiten te nemen ze heeft veel kennis van zowel het bedrijfsleven als het milieu maar hangt nu met haar redelijkheid in het midden van de trapeze
8623931 ze is ongelooflijk rationeel en capabel maar ik denk w l dat ze te vakmatig is om een politiek dier te worden dat kan haar opbreken in den haag

8623945 after a long offseason of conditioning and training our team has done nothing but prepare ourselves mentally and physically for the 2008 season
8623946 after spring ball ended successfully we went into the summer with a positive attitude
8623947 well thats pretty much a wrap up of how were developing as a team and what our current mindset is

8623953 what prosecutors oftentimes want is an admission on the part of the public official and resignation
8623954 its a significant bargaining chip that he has if hes already removed from office then that certainly could have a possible impact on the plea negotiations
8623955 if he wants to leave the criminal cases he is going to need to do it before the removal is resolved
8623956 or you take your chances by going through the removal proceedings you fight that fight and see what happens
8623957 there are public officials who survive these trials and continue in office
8623958 there also are public officials who fight their cases get convicted and serve more time in jail than they would have if they had pleaded guilty or resigned
8623959 the governor is the sole tribunal in removal proceedings with no right of appeal or review afforded the accused
8623960 if the governor acts within the law the governors decision is final
8623961 but i dont believe the question about an appeal has ever been raised
8623962 the plan is to consult with court managers to determine in each court what is the best way we can achieve the savings we need while having the least impact on public access to the courts
8623963 the kinds of questions were asking are should all the courts be closed the same half day each week does it make sense to have some courts closed at different times were pretty much into that kind of micro planning at the moment
8623964 its definitely not going to be to anybodys advantage to close it everything will just get backed up i dont think its such a good idea
8623965 we dont have any illusions in the judicial branch about the somewhat pessimistic economic news that were facing
8623966 the court system knows that it needs to participate with everyone else in government and with all vermonters in identifying ways to make it through this tough time
8623967 the audience is going to fall for miguel prado much like dexter falls for him he becomes a bit of the older brother that dexter really wants dexter has that hole in his life from killing his brother in the first year
8623968 dexter isnt capable of initiating the friendship but he is capable of responding to the overture and responding to the energy that miguel puts out
8623969 is going to change the way she runs the police department because of her close relationship with sgt doakes last year and her disappointment and grief over what happened to him shes going to separate herself from the department a little bit but shell find that its not the best thing to do that these people really are her family

8624099 ethanol is going to be costing you in the supermarket
8624100 because where people used to have wheat and rice growing in the field theyve all switched to corn now people are producing corn and turning it into ethanol the cost of cheese has gone up the cost of bread has gone up the cost of crackers has gone up everything has gone up
8624101 declared his intention to apply this formula on a world scale which means none other than the internationalisation of genocide
8624102 it is not often that this newspaper finds itself in agreement with fidel castro
8624103 the price of corn has a relatively low impact on the overall price of food because theres not that many products when you sit down and think about it that are impacted by the price of corn
8624104 however every product that you buy practically is impacted by the price of oil say you buy a twinkie that twinkie will have traveled 1 500 miles before you buy it you think about that at 4 25 per gallon for diesel fuel and thats a pretty significant number
8624105 when someone talks about the food supply or the diversion of crops they are not being 100 percent honest about factoring in the feed co product that comes from the process
8624106 thats one study there are probably 100 others that find the opposite
8624107 the department of agriculture has one for example what they say is when you factor in the entire process including the production of distillers grains thats that feed co product you get 67 percent more energy than it took to produce and the industry is getting more efficient
8624108 to produce ethanol with as much energy as we use in transportation would require 1 1 billion acres devoted to high yield corn production complete with all the things environmentalists hate fertilizer irrigation and pesticides thats about 1 8 million square miles some 51 percent of the land area of the 50 states
8624109 nobodys talking about that no one is saying ethanol is going to be the gallon for gallon replacement for oil
8624110 but its part of the solution and the land use issue they use some really wide generalities when they look at that issue
8624111 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged

8624411 feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments
8624412 and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process sen obama would go a long way towards healing these wounds if he were to specifically praise the accomplishments of the clinton presidency in a line or two during his speech on thursday

8624456 as the self proclaimed largest pro hunting organization in the world the national rifle association has long claimed to represent americas hunters and shooters in the fight to protect one of americas oldest traditions
8624457 the nras bylaws include an article setting a core goal to promote and defend hunting as a viable and necessary method of fostering the propagation growth and conservation of our renewable wildlife resources but it turns out that its by laws are just empty rhetoric

8624516 i wrote the first draft of the script which to be honest kind of took two years to deliver because i did hot fuzz in the middle of it but i did my first draft of it just before the writers strike last year and i think its one of my favorite things ive ever written it was a real blast to write i know that marvels very pleased with what weve done and really really the appeal to that for me is the fact that like ant man is considered slightly d list the whole raison detre of the piece for me and my thing has always been to take something that would seem to be uncool and make it really cool and thats certainly the case with british cops in hot fuzz to take the most seemingly kind of underwhelming concept and make something really cool out of it i always liked that premise

8624583 in the unlikely event of anyone wanting my advice it would be to stop worrying about selling recordings just give them away let them go put them online for free and tell people that theyre there and if against the odds youve been given some cash youve managed to release an album commercially and you see that someone has posted it on a blog for readers to download for gods sake dont get angry dont see it as being down 20 see it as being up 20 listeners yes your music might conceivably have been stolen but there are no police so get used to it and now youre freed of this burden pursue all the other things that you want from being in a band writing songs rehearsing doing gigs building relationships with other bands going on wallet busting tours receiving unmemorable blowjobs because seriously youre almost more likely to get a blowjob after a gig than sell an mp3 and remember just because music doesnt make you money certainly does not mean that its worth nothing

8624636 i would have a very different career right now and im happy where im at
8624637 i was like all right man im ready i was eager that was great because i just sort of was fuelled you know
8624638 she came up to my dressing room and she was crying and she was like im so proud of you
8624639 i dont get showtime so i dont have any great reference for him and so when he came in to see us last november we couldnt believe that there was this guy who was so charismatic and such a good actor and then when he opened his mouth and sang for us all the little hairs on our arms stood up
8624640 i feel like we just had a very fortuitous moment just the right person the right time the right part
8624641 he has a very empathetic spirit and it allows him to climb into the character from the inside out and in a kind of complete and authentic way hes so big hearted as a person that he can stand at the centre of the story and the audience wants to climb in with him and thats such a gift
8624642 but they definitely put you in a box and my parents were very lenient and very open minded and let me explore for myself what i felt was right and wrong and they raised all their kids that way and none of us have problems with alcohol or drugs

8624654 the tribunals created under article 323 a and 323 b of the constitution are possessed of the competence to test the constitutional validity of statutory provisions and rules all decisions of these tribunals will however be subject to scrutiny before a division bench of the high court within whose jurisdiction the concerned tribunal falls the tribunal will nevertheless continue to act like courts of first instance in respect of the areas of law for which they have been constituted it will not therefore be open or litigants to directly approach the high courts even in cases where they question the vires of statutory legislations except where the legislation which creates the particular tribunal is challenged by overlooking the jurisdiction of the concerned tribunal
8624655 to this end it is suggested that the tribunals be made subject to the supervisory jurisdiction of the high court within whose territorial jurisdiction they fall we are however of the view that this may not be the best way of solving the problem we do not think that our constitutional scheme requires that all adjudicating bodies which fall within the territorial jurisdiction of the high courts should be subject to their supervisory jurisdiction if the idea is to divest the high courts of their onerous burdens then adding to their supervisory functions cannot in any manner be of assistance to them

8624665 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers

8624698 a professor that goes into the classroom and tells his students what to think and who to vote for is committing intellectual intimidation
8624699 ive had students come to me very upset sometimes in tears because they spoke their mind in class about their beliefs and were made fun of ridiculed
8624700 college should be about overcoming bigotry and biases not perpetuating them
8624701 if liberals cant be tolerant of conservatives then who really are the open minded ones
8624702 to me they really typify what it is to be a leader its about being a great person being a great student and being a great football player its about balancing all that stuff and taking all that stuff seriously
8624703 school ratings were really important to my mom when finding a good school to go to
8624704 i went to a college prep school where the best private schools and more elite ones were emphasized and because of the ranking my counselors were okay with my decision
8624705 the ratings were important when i was choosing which college to go to
8624706 i checked out other schools and compared cu to csu and found that cu was better overall
8624707 number one in state makes more of a difference to me than on a national scale im glad that we have a spicy ranch lead over csu
8624708 frankly i think cu should have gotten much better than that based on research productivity which cu is considered as one of the top ten universities nobel prize winners innovation commitment to excellence and that it is number one for nasa funding with public universities
8624709 what matters the most is working hard making connections with faculty members and mentors and a strong grade point average
8624710 do these things well in whatever course and youre likely to have good academic and professional careers
8624711 then again fried is one of those u s officials that likes to feign confusion over russias opposition to the missile shield from the washington post
8624712 there is a russia narrative that we were weak in the 90s but now we are back and we are not going to take it anymore but being angry and seeking revanchist victory is not the sign of a strong nation it is the sign of a weak one
8624713 russia is going to have to come to terms with the reality it can either integrate with the world or it can be a self isolated bully but it cant be both and thats a choice russia has to have
8624714 it will depend on when sales volumes pick up again

8624735 ethanol is going to be costing you in the supermarket
8624736 because where people used to have wheat and rice growing in the field theyve all switched to corn now people are producing corn and turning it into ethanol the cost of cheese has gone up the cost of bread has gone up the cost of crackers has gone up everything has gone up
8624737 declared his intention to apply this formula on a world scale which means none other than the internationalisation of genocide
8624738 it is not often that this newspaper finds itself in agreement with fidel castro
8624739 the price of corn has a relatively low impact on the overall price of food because theres not that many products when you sit down and think about it that are impacted by the price of corn
8624740 however every product that you buy practically is impacted by the price of oil say you buy a twinkie that twinkie will have traveled 1 500 miles before you buy it you think about that at 4 25 per gallon for diesel fuel and thats a pretty significant number
8624741 when someone talks about the food supply or the diversion of crops they are not being 100 percent honest about factoring in the feed co product that comes from the process
8624742 thats one study there are probably 100 others that find the opposite
8624743 the department of agriculture has one for example what they say is when you factor in the entire process including the production of distillers grains thats that feed co product you get 67 percent more energy than it took to produce and the industry is getting more efficient
8624744 to produce ethanol with as much energy as we use in transportation would require 1 1 billion acres devoted to high yield corn production complete with all the things environmentalists hate fertilizer irrigation and pesticides thats about 1 8 million square miles some 51 percent of the land area of the 50 states
8624745 nobodys talking about that no one is saying ethanol is going to be the gallon for gallon replacement for oil
8624746 but its part of the solution and the land use issue they use some really wide generalities when they look at that issue
8624747 today the european court of human rights ruled against mr mckinnons application for rule 39 interim relief
8624748 the temporary prohibition of our clients extradition as granted by the echr on 12 august is now effectively lifted and the authorities of the united kingdom are now free to extradite our client to the united states
8624749 in terms of legal challenges and court proceedings weve gone as far as we can

8624754 part iv elaborates the obscenity doctrines discrimination against gays and lesbians on both equal protection and first amendment grounds
8624755 the collateral effects of the obscenity doctrines current application have discriminated against gays and lesbians further by so discriminating the collateral effects of the doctrine have violated the equal protection clause and the first amendment itself
8624756 with respect to an assessment of the obscenity doctrines collateral effects it is unnecessary to determine the status of the mpaa
8624757 the collateral effects of the doctrine have violated both the equal protection clause and the first amendment itself
8624758 an honest account of the obscenity doctrines history must reflect the fact that not all cases involving depictions of homosexuality have ended badly
8624759 o bscenitys past and present suggest that the doctrine has failed to distinguish between content that is obscene because it contains too much sex and content that is obscene because it contains representations of gays and lesbians
8624760 i t is surely possible that the mpaa rated the films whose scenes this section highlights with a particular rating for reasons other than the sexual orientation of its characters
8624761 offering and analyzing data that seek to demonstrate systematic biases against homosexual content in two major media
8624762 that the obscenity doctrine cannot weigh ones sexual minority status when implementing the 35 second from a first amendment perspective because the
8624763 simply another way that individuals might engage in sex obscenitys discrimination against gays and lesbians constitutes a constitutionally impermissible viewpoint discriminatory restriction on speech
8624764 equal right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
8624765 o nce homosexuality so transforms discrimination against content in light of its homosexuality
8624766 regulation of the subject matter of messages though not as obnoxious as viewpoint based regulation is also an objectionable form of content based regulation
8624767 the obscenity doctrines refusal to distinguish between sex and sexual orientation has left open the possibility that content can be classified as obscene because it is either more naked or in the alternative because it is more gay
8624768 prolonged physical contact with a persons clothed or unclothed genitals
8624769 after miller v california 413 u s 15 1973 some communities banned lesbian or gay romances as well as oral and anal sex

8624781 the fanuzzis know what kind of program we run there are some common friends in there so they were able to do some in depth research on us as men to make sure we were the kind of people they wanted their son around they did that they looked at other universities and were fortunate that they chose rice
8624782 things werent working out the way i planned at alabama and the opportunity to come to a place like this where the coaches and players are one unit is not a hard decision to make
8624783 its a great fit for me and im excited about it
8624784 you have certain places in mind where you see yourself and before you fully commit yourself you have an idea of where youre going to go i visited here before and from what people say about it its a great place to be theres no downside at all from the education the coaches the players its a perfect fit
8624785 it shows that we are building the momentum and getting young men like him that are a great fit for rice
8624786 and thats critical thats key thats why hes here hes a good young man with a great transcript and a great arm

8624792 but bill clinton is also a charmer it is his greatest political gift and he was charming wednesday night now both clintons have a chance to be a plus for obama but one of the greatest contributions they can make is to leave the spotlight there can be only one nominee conventions are a time for unity and good feelings however and the crowd received bill very very warmly wednesday night
8624793 the health inequities we see in the world are absolutely dramatic in their scale
8624794 between countries we have life expectancy differences of more than 40 years a woman in botswana can expect to live 43 years in japan 86 years
8624795 one of the recommendations in the commissions report is that there should be universal health care systems that are available to people regardless of ability to pay
8624796 virtually all advanced countries have universal health care systems but we dont think that should be limited to high income countries we think that could be much more broadly available
8624797 we are distressed by the reports we see of health care simply being unavailable to people because of inability to pay we see that throughout low and middle income countries
8624798 its not perhaps the best use of the money that is being spent and there are a lot people who feel that and would actually like to see coming out of the current campaign in the u s proposals for a universal health insurance
8624799 the importance of prevention continues to grow partly because of escalating health care costs we simply cannot afford the way we go about doing health care nowadays without tackling and doing more prevention

8624823 these six politicians are the leaders and generals in charge of waging an unprecedented war on the poor
8624824 by pushing policies that restrict american energy supply and thus push prices higher they are delivering daily punishment to low income and poor families across the nation what these politicians are doing is immoral and we intend to wake up the american people to the fact that this war being waged in every city in america today
8624825 we call this a war on the poor because high energy prices disproportionately impact americas poor and low income families
8624826 with prices expected to rise this winter from 25 to 50 percent we are in a true crisis these prices are actually a highly regressive tax on americas most vulnerable citizens the war on the poor must stop to do that we must increase our supply of all energy resources including coal oil and gas nuclear power and encourage greater conservation
8624827 a recent study shows that while median income families have to devote five cents on a dollar of their income to energy costs poor families have to devote upwards of 50 cents on the dollar that is fifty cents they cant spend on health care or education or food
8624828 the poor are being decimated by high energy prices which are also driving up food costs and other necessities of life
8624829 unless we as a nation become energy independent we will have to continue sending u s troops overseas to die on foreign soil defending our access to foreign energy that is unacceptable

8624946 when youre 1 11 you know you put yourself in a position where your talent pool is not as great thats just reality
8624947 we know statistically that junior college kids dont always succeed academically and thats our biggest concern
8624948 our coach knows that and our staff knows that but i think the reality is that when youre 1 11 youre looking for some immediate improvement in certain positions

8624953 the figures are excellent news however regular closure causes substantial disruption as well as deterring others from using the network altogether
8624954 these are the donors who we will need to raise money for sen obama

8624986 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8624987 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8624988 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8624989 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8624990 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8625011 india plays a significant role in south asia we accept that india is feeling that it does not have the required resources of energy perhaps this could be an area of cooperation with kazakhstan we could also cooperate with indias policy in afghanistan indias balanced approach to the situation in iran is praiseworthy
8625012 from a trade point of view it is a very key issue to be addressed as the indian market is a very big one
8625013 yes we can discuss this countrys involvement in the project
8625014 we will tell the people that we are diversifying the economy maybe russia and china could get jealous about such an initiative an oil relationship with iran kazakhstan sees this as most beneficial we need to take the u s on board we have to take the opinions of big countries for trading with iran if the situation in afghanistan does not improve we can trade with south asia through iran and therefore a diplomatic solution is required for the iran nuclear issue
8625015 we should stop financing the economy of the war in the last 25 years this sort of financing has taken place in afghanistan two generations of afghanistan have been deprived of a civil education instead they have received a military education in afghanistan today one kilogram of heroin is worth more than one kilogram of grain people are realizing that the war in afghanistan cannot be solved militarily

8625093 before proceeding further the court notes that this case involves two extremely likable lawyers who have together delivered some of the most amateurish pleadings ever to cross the hallowed causeway into galveston an effort which leads the court to surmise but one plausible explanation both attorneys have obviously entered into a secret pact complete with hats handshakes and cryptic words to draft their pleadings entirely in crayon on the back sides of gravy stained paper place mats in the hope that the court would be so charmed by their child like efforts that their utter dearth of legal authorities in their briefing would go unnoticed whatever actually occurred the court is now faced with the daunting task of deciphering their submissions with big chief tablet readied thick black pencil in hand and a devil may care laugh in the face of death life on the razors edge sense of exhilaration the court begins

8625096 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8625097 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8625098 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving
8625099 it was not doing anybody any good so i decided to get involved

8625101 this year ukraines ports are filled with its own grain and therefore russia has problems with delivering grain via ukraine
8625102 grain exports may be redirected to countries like syria or jordan but flour exporters will have a real headache
8625103 after many old cars have been written off traders face problems finding available cars even the new state company which has just started operating is far from perfect
8625104 i think russia will be exporting 2 million tonnes of grain per month in the coming months
8625105 i think we will be able to export up to 2 5 million tonnes in september then we will face botllenecks in october and november at the peak of shipments and we will not be able to export via ukraine

8625113 am adresat autoritatilor rugamintea sa se rectifice ordonanta privind taxa de poluare si normele de aplicare precum si procedura in sine de a ne lasa pe noi companiile de leasing sa ne calculam singuri sumele sa le viram la buget astfel incat clientul sa nu aiba de suferit in legatura cu folosinta bunului

8625146 i cannot circumvent the situation which has developed in south ossetia and caucasus as a whole recent developments have raised great concern over the future and safety in this region the attempted forceful solution of the conflict resulted in deaths of civilians in south ossetia and georgia as well as deaths among russian peacemakers
8625147 seriously undermined the potential for political and legal resolution of this ethno territorial problem
8625148 we are also in favor of increasing the number of international observers in the conflict area and enhancing their role kazakhstan is willing to join in osces efforts aimed at normalization of the situation
8625149 over the past years this initiative has passed a long evolution from the idea of establishing peace and confidence in the asian sub region and all way through the practical mechanisms of collective diplomacy two cica summits were held to usher in new mechanism for maintenance of international safety on the continent the institutionalization phase in the forums evolution is complete now
8625150 it would be expedient to take practical steps towards establishing and strengthening cooperation in military and political dimension which in a long run should become one of the major dimensions of the confidence building measures catalogue

8625153 being aware of collective responsibility for development we urge our partners to give joint cooperation within the framework of
8625154 i am convinced that we will not encounter intractable problems in asia if we address them with interaction and confidence this understanding inspires us and strengthens our belief in the future we are sure of the efficiency of such multilateral mechanisms as cica in ensuring safety and stability

8625160 er is misschien wel een intellectuele verklaring voor onze voorkeuren maar die ligt dan buiten ons vermogen
8625161 ik weet nooit wat ik moet zeggen over mijn persoonlijk leven dus daar zeg ik maar niks over wij maken onze films over dingen die niet in verband staan zelfs niet indirect met ons persoonlijk leven
8625162 waarom gebruiken we geweld waarom gebruiken we het vaak als een grap als oliver hardy zijn bolhoed afneemt om stan laurel een dreun te verkopen dan is dat grappig maar waarom zij weten het niet wij weten het ook niet
8625163 ik heb het gevoel dat uw personages niet zozeer komisch zijn als ze geweld gebruiken maar dat het geweld hoort bij de uitzichtloosheid van hun situatie
8625164 george clooney speelt een marshall die er de hele film prat op gaat dat hij in twintig jaar dienst nog nooit heeft geschoten hij ziet brad pitt in zijn kast staan en schiet hem pardoes overhoop dat heeft niks met de uitzichtloosheid van zijn situatie te maken dat is deel van een goed opgezette grap en als je in het publiek in slaap aan het vallen was ben je nu wakker

8625189 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it

8625191 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

8625212 turbines in the two or three megawatt zone are the most efficient and the best cost per kilowatt
8625213 i see a lot more technology going into each of the components especially the blades
8625214 the blades will look more funky and twisted to get better performance
8625215 were working on supply chain flexibility by providing different technology options
8625216 its all about having options at this point we will structure things to have all the raw materials at the right costs
8625217 the cameras will certainly help us with that but our main objective is to make it a proactive tool so that people know theyre being watched

8625224 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8625225 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8625226 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8625227 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8625228 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8625229 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8625230 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8625242 by way of example during the operation of a music program such as itunes the virtual scroll wheel may appear on the gui of the music program when two fingers are placed on the touch screen rather than one finger which is typically used for tracking in the music program
8625243 in some cases the virtual scroll wheel only appears when two fingers are placed on a predetermined area of the gui

8625250 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8625251 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8625252 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything in her power to elect barack obama
8625253 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us
8625254 more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans that will swell the deficit increase inequality and weaken the economy more band aids for health care that will enrich insurance companies impoverish families and increase the number of uninsured more going it alone in the world instead of building the shared responsibilities and shared opportunities necessary to advance our security and restore our influence
8625255 will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years and back to hope
8625256 and so if you like me believe that america must always be a place called hope then join hillary and chelsea and me in making barack obama the next president of the united states
8625257 the reason is that after 25 plus years i am ready to change my focus away from managing a business and towards doing what i love most training dogs and their owners to be the best that they can be

8625265 the economic environment continued to negatively impact mobile phones sales in both mature and emerging markets
8625266 consumers in mature markets continued to favor mid tier devices over high end devices while new subscribers continued to join mobile networks in emerging markets during the quarter however replacement sales remained weak as consumers faced higher prices for fuel and food in addition to higher levels of inflation

8625271 does not use the phrase war on terrorism more remarkably he doesnt mention islam much less islamic extremism which mr bush has described as a critical ideological threat to freedom inside and outside the muslim world
8625272 terrorism is a means not an end and very different groups and countries are using it toward very different goals if we cant even identify the enemy or describe the war were fighting its difficult to see how we will win
8625273 the war in chechnya is a war of liberation it engaged in terrorist activities but it is fundamentally different
8625274 there has been a shift in islam that i believe is connected to the failures of governments and the failures of the west to work with many of these countries in order to make sure that opportunities are there that theres bottom up economic growth
8625275 failures of the west to work with many of these countries
8625276 but what we also want to do is to shrink the pool of potential recruits and that involves engaging the islamic world rather than vilifying it and making sure that we understand that not only are those in islam who would resort to violence a tiny fraction of the islamic world but that also the islamic world itself is diverse

8625286 the tanks were in a huge warehouse that is not suited for gas storage it was filled with wooden platforms and had no fire extinguishing system in place it posed a very grave threat to local residents

8625298 with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8625299 the government is talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut

8625345 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8625346 this speech and the election is not about barack obama its about the american people and the direction we need to go in to get us out of the ditch we are in
8625347 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8625348 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8625349 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8625350 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution
8625351 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8625352 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8625353 it is in our view an important step forward to understanding the properties of the mysterious dark matter
8625354 dark matter makes up five times more matter in the universe than ordinary matter this study confirms that we are dealing with a very different kind of matter unlike anything that we are made of
8625355 and were able to study it in a very powerful collision of two clusters of galaxies
8625356 that germany is still in better shape than most other eurozone economies
8625357 the clock for the german labour market is literally ticking it is only a matter of time before the economic slowdown will be felt
8625358 we expect clearer traces of the economic slowdown to become visible later this year
8625359 was in line with the trend established over the past two years
8625360 to fall modestly further during the latter months of 2008 and possibly even in early 2009 despite the dampening influence from the slowdown in economic growth
8625361 there has been no excessive hiring in the current cycle
8625362 the labour market has become more flexible mostly through deregulation of temporary employment
8625363 natixis has felt the full force since june of the sudden and violent decline in the financial markets
8625364 has suffered the consequences of the crisis which have weighed on its financial results
8625365 the good performance in commercial activity insurance and property services do not fully compensate for the negative effects of this crisis
8625366 we have walked out because they have refused to respond many mps requested a select committee to be formed but the minister home minister syed hamid albar refused
8625367 there is no point staying and participating in the debate
8625368 they walked out contrary to the rules because they dont want to accept defeat they know that they will be defeated
8625369 they walked out because they dont want it to appear like a failure for its leader who has said that he will be able to win over barisan nasional mps
8625370 the prime minister has lost the mandate of the country and the nation
8625371 there is no threat from anwar he has won in a by election and he becomes just another mp
8625372 there is no nato naval build up in the black sea as russian authorities are claiming in the media
8625373 this deployment is routine in nature and has been planned for over a year notification of the requirement to transit the turkish straits was given in june well before the current georgia crisis and is completely unrelated
8625374 we are trying to draw up a strong text showing our desire not to accept
8625375 just because theyre upset that the little pet of certain western capitals didnt fulfill their expectations
8625376 the sco member states express their deep concern over the recent tensions surrounding the south ossetia question and call for the sides to peacefully resolve existing problems through dialogue
8625377 the presidents confirmed their commitment to the principle of respecting the historical and cultural traditions of each country and efforts aimed at maintaining the unity of states and their territorial integrity
8625378 i am sure that the united position of the sco member states will have international resonance
8625379 and i hope it will serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white and justify this aggression
8625380 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8625381 as much as i want to go home its quite pointless as im not going to anything
8625382 i wanted to get in there are really find out if i wanted to go
8625383 who would have thought that the man who poisoned your sons fathers and husbands while the so called civilized world stood by and did nothing would fall from power so disgracefully
8625384 recognising the unique history of colonisation on indigenous peoples and the need for special measures
8625385 the commission sets closing the gap as a goal for the whole world and produces the evidence on how health inequities are a reflection of the way we organise society and distribute power and resources
8625386 the good news from the report for australia is that it provides plenty of ideas on how to set an agenda that will tackle the underlying determinants of health and create a healthier australia for all of us
8625387 this may not be everyones choice for the ideal hangout but its just about perfect in my book
8625388 this canoe on the ceiling just reminds me that i own a yacht in greenwich
8625389 but wouldnt it be even better if it had a club all decorated with faux wood panels translucent deer heads and an mock wood fire and wouldnt it be awesome i continued if they charged you 15 per drink and had a dj spinning for all the world like he was on crack
8625390 i may look stuck up but no please dont turn away i actually want to talk and mingle and feel single but wait once i start revealing myself a little more i actually could be stuck up wow
8625391 sorry man you were charged the correct price the sign is wrong
8625392 i never in life thought i would live long enough to see an african american candidate with the strong possibility and the support
8625393 ive watched all of our people from shirley chisholm on and thought america wasnt quite ready i think we may be ready now if we can remember who we are as a people
8625394 then the people started coming from every direction in buses walking and the next thing we knew that whole space was occupied
8625395 to hear dr king talk about a dream that we all had the placards we were carrying about housing health care employment and justice and fairness we knew something important was happening that day
8625396 seeing how relatives were being treated in the south and how it was different in the north there were colored signs that my cousins had to obey i wanted to be part of something that would change that
8625397 a risk i would rather say its an opportunity if you listened to the keynote speech yesterday david reeves said this is the most important title for next year i believe its an opportunity to expand the market also
8625398 its an opportunity to get people on board with traditional games
8625399 everybody likes stories like characters likes emotions and its an interesting way to get people playing on playstation 3
8625400 wtf what do these yanks know about girls raised in the south
8625401 people in new york are not aware of real barbecue new yorks idea of barbecue is the same as wisconsins idea of new york pizza
8625402 in georgia succulent barbecue is made by steaming the meat
8625403 afghan national security forces ansf and coalition forces killed over 100 insurgents during combat operations in helmand province august 25th 28th
8625404 ansf and coalition forces were conducting security patrols in the province when they were attacked multiple times by insurgents using small arms rocket propelled grenade and mortar fire sparking numerous engagements
8625405 heavy casualties were inflicted during fierce fighting between afghan soldiers and insurgents but the exact number of casualties is not known
8625406 twelve dead bodies of the insurgents were left on the battlefield
8625407 repeal will have a greater impact outside the state than at home
8625408 this is the sad sorry state of conservative pro family movement in america
8625409 there are too many groups that are afraid of having the liberal press call them names or afraid of being called extremist or afraid of taking on the homosexual movement they want it easy and its just not going to be easy unfortunately
8625410 hell get to appoint as many as possibly three out of five of the fcc commissioners
8625411 and certainly this is going to be something thats going to remain an issue its certainly an issue with voters and hopefully whoevers elected president will make broadcast decency enforcement a priority just like its been a priority under fcc chairman kevin martin
8625412 for example one reference is that bin laden had planned to sponsor a suicide car bombing campaign against americans and u s interests and businesses in the u k as a way of punishing england for cooperating with the united states against terror and for forbidding osama bin laden from returning to the united kingdom because he had previously visited there
8625413 this is additional new information that confirms clintons knowledge of osama bin ladens threat where nothing was done
8625414 this case indicates that north korea is still stepping up its policy of trying to communise the south and spreading it deep into our society
8625415 it must be clearly understood that any military cadres can be targeted
8625416 mcdonalds actually has been on our screen or prohibited list since 1999 so this is nothing new
8625417 what is new is the aggressive approach that theyre moving to in promoting and supporting the homosexual agenda
8625418 which means he is saying im in great pain and great sorrow
8625419 and i think as believers in a free nation like this we need to be asking the lord to give us a burden to understand the pain and suffering of multitudes of christians our brothers and sisters and to pray for them perhaps to take a day of the week to fast and pray for them
8625420 a concern that weve had for many years is that because more men come to us for help women have had a tendency to get lost in the leftovers of our ministry
8625421 we are launching this ministry because we want to offer intentional specific help that meets the needs of women affected by unwanted homosexuality
8625422 the christian church must be a place that powerfully conveys compassionate truth to hurting women
8625423 my goal is to help more women find real hope and help as they journey towards wholeness in their femininity in christ and to equip others to do the same
8625424 we are launching this ministry because we want to offer intentional specific help that meets the needs of women affected by unwanted homosexuality
8625425 we got a decent boost from the stimulus which hit the economy at a time when we really needed it
8625426 it will have less of an impact going forward though and we may even have a payback in the fourth quarter
8625427 we would have had growth even without the stimulus as much of the rise in gdp had to do with the trade deficit
8625428 without a price spiral the fed wont have to squeeze the life out the economy which should help sustain modest economic growth
8625429 its early in the campaign season and in the end the vote on this measure could be hard to predict
8625430 the burden is always on the yes side to convince people there is good reason to vote for the measure
8625431 their position on banning it could be explained by a hesitancy to remove a constitutional right
8625432 although they know gods righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them
8625433 i was headed out to dinner one night with my mother after a church service
8625434 i actually went up to the station where the train comes by and i was approaching the platform when i saw a man who was blind
8625435 the lord just kind of pretty much popped it into my head at that moment
8625436 mettere in pratica molte sue idee in materia di giustizia
8625437 comincia a farsi strada la consapevolezza che la carriera dei pm non pu essere identica a quella del magistrati giudicante investigatore luno arbitro laltro
8625438 never look down to test the ground before taking your next step only he who keeps his eyes fixed on the far horizon will find the right road
8625439 if you want others to be happy practice compassion if you want to be happy practice compassion
8625440 the united states has significantly underreported the number of new h i v infections occurring nationally each year
8625441 the direct impact of the underreporting has had the effect of not making this epidemic as much of a crisis as it is weve said all along that that the numbers of new cases in the state are not flat or dropping and that they only continue to go up
8625442 having the right numbers is important to us because it allows us to detect and estimate the burden its important to guide congress and the state legislature
8625443 tell us whether or not our prevention efforts and activities are working or not
8625444 its important because we need to increase funding for prevention and then care and treatment
8625445 the findings confirm that h i v the virus that causes aids has its greatest effect among gay and bisexual men of all races 53 percent of all new infections and among african american men and women
8625446 was a five thousand word screed that accused nearly everyone connected with health care in america officials at the centers for disease control in atlanta researchers at the national institutes of health in washington doctors at memorial sloan kettering cancer center in manhattan and local politicians particularly mayor ed koch of refusing to acknowledge the implications of the nascent aids epidemic
8625447 unless we fight for our lives we shall die every gay man who is unable to come forward now and fight to save his own life is truly helping to kill the rest of us
8625448 infection rates especially for men who have sex with men and people of color are going through the roof
8625449 this conference was a marker of shame not a marker of progress
8625450 how did we gay men manage to get lulled into this quiet pervasive homophobia in the aids field
8625451 fifty percent of countries dont even collect data on men who have sex with men
8625452 which is completely homophobic and with no data you cant make an argument for prevention much less treatment or care
8625453 its my group no its my group back and forth
8625454 other than gay black men theres no other group other than men who have sex with men that is so disproportionately affected by this epidemic with the numbers still getting worse
8625455 we are not effectively reaching men who have sex with men and african americans to lower their risk
8625456 weve drifted to the point where were not even being outraged by this its yawn yawn and yawn even within the gay community
8625457 if you dont talk about aids through the prism of women and girls youre misogynist and sexist the face of hiv today is a young girl in africa were not paying attention to the logic of epidemiology and thats basic bad public health
8625458 when hiv dawned in the u s it first hit the gay community and it didnt matter to most people because they were immoral and despised by god that was until money came into the picture now again its the gay community that no one seems to care about they didnt matter then and they dont matter now
8625459 these comparisons are totally unacceptable and take credibility away from the very real objections made about these cuts
8625460 civilized political discourse as canadians gear up for what is expected to be a fall election
8625461 the comparison of canadas prime minister to nazi leader adolf hitler is obscene and offensive
8625462 such statements trivialize the holocaust and inject ugly rhetoric in what ought to be reasoned debate on real and pressing political issues
8625463 we must wonder about the sincerity of a government that recognizes the people of quebec as a nation when it does not hesitate to cut into the very heart of its existence culture
8625464 in addition to ensuring the financial stability of dozens of organizations across canada the financial support of government facilitates the collection of private donations which in turn can promote production here and abroad
8625465 imagine if we bought another player with the same characteristics

8625472 barack obama will bring down health care costs by 2 500 for the typical family and at long last deliver affordable accessible health care for all americans
8625473 weve been in south korea weve been in japan for 60 years weve been in south korea for 50 years or so thatd be fine with me as long as americans as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed then its fine with me i hope it would be fine with you if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al qaida is training recruiting and equipping and motivating people every single day
8625474 we believe that this aviation regulator is unfit for purpose
8625475 we continue to see hard to believe gdp numbers other broad measures of output do not show this kind of strength they are running a lot weaker than the gdp figure this number seems to overstate the underlying strength even though exports are obviously strong
8625476 i think this bodes well gdp continues to build the bull case that weve been too pessimistic and the outlook for the fourth quarter has been played down so much that if gasoline prices at the pump stay below 4 a gallon you build the case for a big positive upside surprise
8625477 i think what it does mean is that some of the highly confident assertions about where the economy was going in february march and april proved to be completely wrong i think its clear that the second quarter not only wasnt a recession quarter it was actually a very robust quarter
8625478 the us economy in general is performing at a better level than what people probably expected two or three months ago and the us has the potential to lead global growth in the second half of the year
8625479 the market is gaining increasing confidence the strain in the financial markets and high oil prices will not tip the economy into a recession
8625480 the outlook for the economy is still bleak as consumer confidence remains low and the housing market is still grinding lower the outlook for third quarter gdp is less than 1 so i still have a negative outlook
8625481 i will choose to share think the world of you lisa you know that
8625482 i wouldnt want to do anything different you have been my best buddy on the show
8625483 i am thrilled that the cemetery will be completed and available for interment in the next couple of months
8625484 this new cemetery will serve nearly 200 000 veterans in the jacksonville area who currently do not have access to a veterans cemetery
8625485 the bank turned in a solid performance this quarter driven in particular by a strong contribution from the financial markets segment and good growth in business volumes at personal and commercial
8625486 moreover our financial health remains excellent as evidenced by the good credit quality of the loan portfolio and our high regulatory capital ratios
8625487 there is still a relatively large gap between china and the best in the world in the high profile items like athletics swimming and cycling and also in the popular ball sports
8625488 also we have already mined our full potential in our strong sports at beijing only through widening our gold winning face can we adapt to the fierce competition in future
8625489 has turned down the giants offer to lure him back to action
8625490 when nomar runs it looks like hes dragging a dead body
8625491 the die to a large degree is probably cast so him trying to play an extra season is not going to change much
8625492 has turned down the giants offer to lure him back to action

8625494 instant feedback from the people from face to face contact and phone calls

8625527 a lot of people are concerned about sea level rise in coastal areas which is obviously a very serious and legitimate concern but i think that the kinds of problems were projecting here in new mexico in some ways are worse and they are going to hit us faster
8625528 that were going to get hit harder and faster than the coastal areas that get so much attention
8625529 well weve certainly seen that here in new mexico in the last five years droughts and floods
8625530 its an issue thats right here in front of us
8625531 cap and trade programs have worked for other pollutants like sulfur dioxide the acid rain program was very successful and thats the basis for the kyoto protocol as well
8625532 so its not just a good idea to cut your companys emissions its required by law and there will be enforcement mechanisms around this companies are obligated to comply and if they dont theyll have to pay the consequences
8625533 the difference is that now we have used up all slack in the schedule for actions needed to defuse the global warming time bomb
8625534 in my opinion these ceos should be tried for high crimes against humanity and nature
8625535 if i had one single overarching message to convey it would be that we already see significant climate warming in new mexico and continuing warming is highly likely to continue and have profound effects in terms of both temperature and water management in the 21st century
8625536 so we should get serious now about planning for new mexicos future in a much warmer climate
8625537 from the perspective of wildlife and habitat conservation many of these changes involve species populations declines in both sensitive and non sensitive species
8625538 which can include how we recreate fire hazards erosion hazards much less what happens to all the other species that once used the forests that will have died
8625539 im hopeful that well be able to for certain landscapes work out activities and actions to lessen the impacts so that we can keep extinctions at a minimum prioritize areas that are susceptible to climate change and be smart about how we allocate money and take action
8625540 but given that even if we cut our emissions down to almost nothing this machine is set into motion and were going to experience climate change
8625541 and we need to decide where do we go and what do we do on the landscape to try to mitigate the effects of climate change so that species can adapt
8625542 to a degree you can focus on the bleak future thats presented for new mexico in particular
8625543 but the reality is this is also a great opportunity for our state and for our country to really move forward with policies that i think will benefit us long term socially culturally economically politically
8625544 so when were talking about greenhouse gas pollution from the oil and gas industry the solutions to that problem not only deal with climate but they also deal with energy
8625545 in terms of that if you put those solutions into motion into practice if you implement them on the ground in the gas patch in the oil patch then you put more of the product in the pipeline for consumers
8625546 weve become a nation of pessimists at some level and thats only a recent phenomenon
8625547 if we think long term if we get out of this vicious trap of crisis by crisis management and really take in the long view i think we can really do it here in new mexico
8625548 frankly im optimistic its going to be a lot of hard work but its going to be a lot of good work
8625549 all these places are seeing signs of diebacks of forests and patchy in places but its starting to show up and people are starting to see it
8625550 weve started to see patterns emerge that perhaps in these most vulnerable places the forests are starting to be killed by climate stress
8625551 its a precursor for what we can predict that the dominant vegetation is going to have to change
8625552 obviously it takes 100 years to grow a 100 year old tree
8625553 but it can be knocked out in a couple of months

8625555 the development of global institutions that take into account not just traditional measures of economic health like per capita gdp public debt balance of trade etc but also the manner in which that health can be sustained
8625556 i t is unrealistic to expect the united states to continue to occupy the near omnipotent global position that it held during the early 1990s
8625557 rising powers like china india japan brazil and even the e u simply wont permit it
8625558 we spend more than half a trillion dollars a year on defense and yet had no real military options when russia recently invaded georgia

8625564 playing against marquette if we dont stay at a high level of playing theyre going to take over this match thats going to be the big challenge for us

8625573 consolidation has a larger more important affect on gaming it turns developers into game lovers that just want to create new and unique titles to developers that are run by suits and care only about the profit potential of each title
8625574 consolidation in the video game industry could ruin its ability to offer innovation and compelling titles
8625575 since the age of consolidation hit the video game industry it has changed drastically
8625576 granted sales are higher than they ever have been and more people are playing video games than ever before but the video games themselves have lost much of their appeal

8625669 according to malaysian communications and multimedia commission mcmc chief operating officer mohamed sharil tarmizi as quoted by
8625670 i think we dont intend to curtail peoples freedom and right to give information and debate but when you publish content that is libellous defamatory and slanderous to other people i think it is only natural we take action
8625671 often compelled to ignore or to play down the many events organised by the opposition
8625672 stuff is all we have were being sold to in the same way as everyone in the mass media sells to everyone that we sort of despise but youre just as guilty of the keeping up with the joneses mentality as your parents or grandparents its not a display of wealth its about a display of authenticity and taste and so its just my anger about that competition and what im angry about is i just cant stop myself from doing it
8625673 this was a nasty attack which left a 20 year old woman with a broken jaw

8625679 and theyre basically able to utilise the assets because our team has brought lego characters to life
8625680 my understanding is that they will use the engine the maya files where the characters come to life but theyll be creating animated i think its a 20 minute cartoon im personally quite intrigued to see how it comes out lego every time theyve had a new brand out theyve done some cgi stuff as well but i think this will be quite different

8625684 que uno de mis hijos est a tu derecha y el otro a tu izquierda
8625685 aunque exist a con el mismo ser de dios no se aferr a ello sino que renunci a lo que era suyo y tom naturaleza de siervo haci ndose como todos los hombres y present ndose como un hombre cualquiera se humill asi mismo
8625686 una de las seducciones en las cuales los siervos f cilmente pueden sucumbir es usar el poder y las cosas a las que tienen acceso para sus fines personales muy pronto esto incluye usar a la gente para fines ego stas el fin puede tomar la forma de ganancia monetaria o material

8625697 slept through everything and didnt know it was going on
8625698 developing rsm pedals has been a multi year program for us that has resulted in a platform on which we can develop in many directions
8625699 our 24 bit hardware firmware and software system will allow us to model many acoustic spaces instruments and electronic modifications at very little cost to the customer one could easily be misled by the compact pedal form factor but under the hood of our rsm processors you will find a lot of substantial fx for djs keyboardists and guitar amp effects loops alike
8625700 the reverb machine sounds amazing and has a lot of controls to dial in a perfect reverb sound i played it through a couple of amps that are known for their classic sounding reverb and the rv600 did more than hold its own it automatically earned a place on my pedalboard the first time i heard it

8625702 we do have some cricket in the near future so its important that we finish on a high note
8625703 we played some really good cricket throughout the test series and one dayers and it will be disappointing if you just give up in the next game
8625704 we had our opportunities our one day cricket hasnt been consistent
8625705 whenever we are at the nets or batting together he tells me how to plan he is such a class reader of the game and he always plays with responsibility we learn a lot from him while batting with him it is good we got partnerships in two matches
8625706 the toss proved crucial it put the indians in an advantageous position but i should say we made too many mistakes along the way there was lack of consistent partnerships from the batters and that did not help the team at all
8625707 few speeches have mattered as much as this one as he walks down the 20 yard runway toward the lectern he will have plenty to contemplate can he deliver a speech rich in both policy and passion can he stand out and yet not stand apart
8625708 yes there are so many things that we want to do more than we can do with the resources so when london studio was looking at the early work on eyepet and the prototype of eight days they knew they couldnt do all of them and there are even more things theyre working on at early concept stage
8625709 so your expertise and ideas are best spent on some titles rather than others
8625710 both stations found that the cross promotion between the stations and wikitalk led to higher traffic on their sites

8625768 i think there is a world market for maybe 5 computers
8625769 in the unlikely event of anyone wanting my advice it would be to stop worrying about selling recordings just give them away let them go put them online for free and tell people that theyre there and if against the odds youve been given some cash youve managed to release an album commercially and you see that someone has posted it on a blog for readers to download for gods sake dont get angry dont see it as being down 20 see it as being up 20 listeners yes your music might conceivably have been stolen but there are no police so get used to it and now youre freed of this burden pursue all the other things that you want from being in a band writing songs rehearsing doing gigs building relationships with other bands going on wallet busting tours receiving unmemorable blowjobs because seriously youre almost more likely to get a blowjob after a gig than sell an mp3 and remember just because music doesnt make you money certainly does not mean that its worth nothing

8625783 unfortunately this tournament could be won or lost on the greens
8625784 its a big deal as it is and you dont want to stand over a three footer wondering if the ball is going to run straight
8625785 i dont know what came to my mind i did it because i have become desperate since my parents disowned me

8625792 even where they are provided they are an eyesore because the council takes time to empty them causing people to dump their waste matter in the gutters hoping that they would be washed away by rain water
8625793 my store is flooded with run offs because the gutters are blocked by dirt
8625794 i was able to arrange my goods and keep those that could be soaked away from the water i always go back to my store whenever it is raining to prevent a disaster

8625878 a man should not let his intimidation by people prevent him from speaking the truth if he knows it witnesses it or hears it
8625879 if it is said that the one who has haya is shy to speak the truth causing him to leave off commanding the good and forbidding the bad and that his haya leads him to shortcomings in fulfilling some obligations as is normally the case i say that this is not true haya rather it is incompetence and weakness and subjugation and it is referred to as haya simply by way of likeness and simile true haya is only when the thing he has haya of doing is truly bad and there is no consideration for what the people consider to be bad when it is in fact something good or vice versa and it is established that the prophet had more haya than a virgin in the innermost portion of her home and he is an example for us in this with this there was nothing to prevent his anger if the limits of allah were violated

8625892 i performed the hajj with sufyan and he would come and go with his tongue never ceasing to command the good and forbid the evil
8625893 o aba abdillah this is my ring work for this nation according to the quran and the sunnah
8625894 do you permit me to speak o commander of the believers can i speak with your promise not to harm me
8625895 do not send for me again until i come to you myself and to not give me anything unless i ask you for something
8625896 what made you refuse he only asked you to work according to the quran and sunnah
8625897 i was unable to look at sufyan out of haya and intimidation from him
8625898 fear allah you are in this position and have this power due to the swords of the muhajirin and ansar and their sons are dying of hunger umar made the hajj and spent only fifteen dinar s and he used to shade himself under the trees
8625899 no just be below what you are and above what i am

8626017 look hes a kid with an enormous amount of talent and skill well a lot of other people have the skill to be a great doctor and yet they decide they dont want to be a doctor anymore hes a 19 year old who maybe has to grow up a little bit yet its not a health issue not as far as i know he wont be attending training camp hes taking time to think things over in my opinion stefan just wants to take a break hes tired from all the things hes gone through the last two seasons all the tournaments the games the shoulder injury all that stuff he feels like he needs some time and space
8626018 when does training camp start sept 19 or 20 until sept 20 he hasnt quit anything
8626019 absolutely yes i think were dealing with a case of burnout here you cant be filled with that much passion for the sport of hockey and decide right like that that youre done with it i think hes going to play again in fact i think when the frost hits the ground hes going to get the itch
8626020 i cant say hes in the process of reconsidering no hes not in the process of anything right now to be honest with you
8626021 i can tell them that we bought the team to have it here in columbus were dedicated to keeping it in columbus but i cant offer guarantees i am reasonably comfortable that well be here for a long time certainly every fiber of what we try to do is to fulfill that original thought my father worked on various sports commissions for probably 35 years to get a pro team for this town it was one of his dreams now sometimes in life you have to do what you have to do but i would consider it a personal defeat if we ended up in that situation

8626087 es un honor tener la posibilidad de llevar la bandera porque aqu hay grandes deportistas
8626088 una mejor formaci n y un aumento del periodo de contrataci n
8626089 b sica y fundamental para mejorar los ndices de eficacia y eficiencia a la hora de afrontar cualquier tipo de emergencia
8626090 durante la anterior legislatura el consell potenci mucho la figura del paraje natural municipal
8626091 de hecho 44 de los 49 parajes que existen actualmente en la comunitat valenciana han sido declarados por la generalitat en los ltimos cuatro a os
8626092 que han demostrado su inter s por proteger sus espacios naturales
8626093 muy positivo que los municipios colaboren con la generalitat en la conservaci n y la mejora de sus espacios naturales porque entre todas las administraciones p blicas podemos desarrollar unas pol ticas medioambientales m s eficaces

8626107 se trata de trabajos que no superan el medio mill n de euros en inversi n pero que mejoran los centros educativos
8626108 aumentaron m s de un 20 por ciento respecto al curso pasado y eso tiene que ver con libros de texto transporte escolar becas y comedores
8626109 la educaci n p blica est teniendo un apoyo presupuestario muy importante de la generalitat
8626110 nuestra voluntad es que esta iniciativa quede plasmada en papel
8626111 vuelvan a la normalidad que a veces es una tarea m s complicada que sufrir la propia emergencia
8626112 existen 299 municipios con riesgo de inundaciones de los que 48 tienen riesgo alto y abarcan a una poblaci n de m s de dos millones de habitantes y 88 con riesgo medio

8626114 una interpretaci n visual inmediata del fen meno de preemergencia o emergencia
8626115 los mapas se especificar n por comarcas para que la informaci n sea m s detallada y cada zona conozca qu medidas tomar y qu organismos movilizar
8626116 la preemergencia de inundaciones se activa desde el momento en que el centro de coordinaci n de emergencias cce auton mico recibe un aviso meteorol gico con riesgo de precipitaciones intensas
8626117 la activaci n inmediata del plan especial ante el riesgo de inundaciones con la notificaci n a los municipios y a los diversos organismos y servicios implicados
8626118 la anticipaci n la prevenci n la planificaci n y la coordinaci n constituyen las mejores herramientas y por tanto son la mejor garant a ante cualquier emergencia por lluvias

8626135 insbesonders die haltung der versicherungsmakler hat mich berrascht forderte doch riedlsperger die verl ngerung des nebengewerbes
8626136 der versuch das recht der versicherungsvermittlung in einer gro en l sung neu zu gestalten ist leider gescheitert wie ich in insgesamt 3 verhandlungsrunden erkennen musste gab es offenbar einen deal zwischen versicherungsmakler und verm gensberatern die auf kosten der agenten ihre rechte massiv ausweiten wollten da k nnen wir versicherungsagenten bei aller bereitschaft zum gespr ch nicht mit
8626137 dass die verm gensberater das nebengewerbe weiterf hren und ausbauen wollen ist verst ndlich doch wie k nnen maklervertreter diesem plan zustimmen das widerspricht dem ureigensten interessen des berufsstandes der versicherungsmakler hier wird sich riedlsperger fachverbandsobmann der versicherungsmakler vor seinen mitgliedern erkl ren m ssen

8626140 eine stadtwache ist jedenfalls in keiner weise ein ersatz f r die polizei bei der bek mpfung der kriminalit t das unterstreicht auch ein in den usa soeben ver ffentlichtes akribisch recherchiertes buch in dem sich die beiden autoren u a am beispiel new york eingehend mit dem zusammenhang zwischen dem personalstand bei der echten polizei und der kriminalit tsentwicklung auseinandersetzten f r experten ist die kernerkenntnis der untersuchungen wenig berraschend je weniger polizistinnen es gibt desto st rker steigt die anzahl der strafbaren handlungen je mehr exekutivemitarbeiterinnen ihren dienst vor ort versehen umso st rker sinkt die kriminalit t
8626141 die vormalige schwarzblauorange bundesregierung und ihre vp innenministerinnen haben bedauerlicherweise genau den schlechten teil der gleichung gew hlt
8626142 durch die ausgepr gten sparma nahmen bei der wiener polizei ab dem jahr 2000 ist die zahl der strafbaren handlungen in folge stark angestiegen doch statt vernunftm ig die polizeipr senz zu verst rken und damit gegen die unerfreuliche entwicklung zu steuern hat die damalige regierung noch mehr polizistinnen abgebaut in new york hingegen wurde die zahl der polizistinnen stark erh ht die kriminalit t ist danach stark zur ckgegangen die v llig unbefriedigende kriminalit tsentwicklung in wien ist also eindeutig auf die jahrelang falsche sicherheitspolitik der vp und in keiner weise auf die in wien nicht vorhandene stadtwache zur ckzuf hren

8626152 he voted 19 times against the minimum wage people struggling to make it to the next day thats not change thats more of the same

8626233 obviously im delighted to come back to city and i just cant wait to get started again
8626234 ive always admired him and hes certainly been a target of mine since i came to the football club
8626235 to actually secure the deal and bring shaun back home is a fantastic coup for us and im sure the supporters will be just as excited as we are to have him back at manchester city
8626236 i think its extremely sad its sad that his was the first head to roll and if his is the only one to roll that would be completely wrong
8626237 i feel privileged to have worked for the fringe it is the greatest arts festival on the planet and plays an important role in developing and showcasing new performing talent on a world stage
8626238 however the role of fringe director has taken me away from my first love producing and presenting exciting performance to audiences and my intention is to return to that more direct relationship with artists and audiences
8626239 his significant contribution to the fringe at a challenging time of great change
8626240 i think he has done the honourable thing and i dont think he had any other choice
8626241 hes not the only person whos at risk in this whole scenario and its the fringe board itself that has something to answer for but he did take decisions which werent the right ones
8626242 if it is not god somebody should tell me who has kept me safe and alive all these years despite the tribulations and the unexpected things that happened to me i lost my little daughter and i grieved so much but there have still been some moments of happiness for me
8626243 im testifying that against all the odds he makes me see the light and i know he can do the same for everyone else
8626244 all along i thought i had the strength to carry on i thought it was mainly me but as i moved on i realised more and more that it is god who has the authority to control everything now i understand that he has his own ways of shaping up his people to do what he wants them to do till the end of time so we have to just flow along with him and thank him for his mercies
8626245 im just trying to put god as the supremo we all make music and name them anyhow people say what you call it does not matter and all that but what matters most to me now is eternity what matters is what happens to me when im no more on this earth why do i then have to put my hope in things that are not important for my salvation
8626246 i dont know my mum my father was not there all the time but still look at where god wanted me to be i know there might be many people in situations like mine who had nobody there for them but they dont have to rely on human beings because we are all going to die and each is accountable to the maker
8626247 if he did not love us where would have come the love that we are giving out to others being blessed with seven albums in ten years is abundant grace
8626248 i talked a lot on those albums about the negative influences of having money you cannot control people have so much money and are worshipping it money is not everything also if you have worked hard and the money is not coming you do not have to resort to wrong means to get it
8626249 im a soldier in the army of the lord life is a struggle you get to a time when you think there is no more hope and you become really desperate some people even kill themselves when they get to that stage i hear lots of negative things about myself but i also hear many positive things
8626250 i have been bombarded with all sorts of vibes people try to distract you but the best thing is to stay focussed and move on if people have the time to fabricate stories about you it means you are somebody it is not important to hold on to what they say let your track record speak for you
8626251 in my view it was becca that turned the place upside down with her performance
8626252 i see her perform whenever i can but she showed me she was an artiste on a well defined mission last saturday
8626253 she likes to raise the bar for herself all the time and always wants to prove that she is getting better all the time she did a lot of spontaneous things on stage and i felt really proud of her on the night
8626254 i wonder how he is able to keep all those wicked ga expressions in his head
8626255 i would never want it assumed that i wasnt doing everything i can to get back because thats not who i am

8626283 to find so many polar bears at sea at one time is extremely worrisome because it could be an indication that as the sea ice on which they live and hunt continues to melt many more bears may be out there facing similar risk

8626286 in order to better understand people i need to listen to them
8626287 if we can create easily accessible channels through which we can listen to nature we might get meaning and information that we wouldnt otherwise know
8626288 replaced people with machines so as to listen continuously and understand as much as possible but it turns out that a lot of citizen scientists including myself would rather be outdoors so the focus turned to how to better tell the story of nature through people

8626294 its deeply troubling and unfortunate that president bush should fire this parting shot at womens access to basic health care in the waning days of his administration
8626295 time and time again he has put political and ideological concerns above the best interests of the american people and this is yet another example
8626296 we continue to be very concerned about the scope and impact of this proposed rule it leaves open the possibility that institutions and individuals can deny access to birth control and permits individuals to refuse to provide even counseling about basic heath care services
8626297 for years federal law has carefully balanced protections for individual religious liberty and patients access to reproductive health care
8626298 the time for the department of homeland security dhs to scrap their current approach to airline security is well overdue now that the terrorist screening centers terrorist watch lists have passed one million entries
8626299 the american people would be comforted if our presidential candidates denounced these burdensome practices senators mccain and obama should declare a moratorium on the use of the lists unless drastic measures are taken to improve their accuracy and protect innocent americans hoping to travel without burden
8626300 watch list systems are worse than worthless they create security risks by diverting scarce homeland security resources away from actual terrorists by focusing attention on hundreds of thousands if not millions of innocent travelers those innocent victims wrongly caught in the dragnet of suspicion are left without recourse to clear their good name upon completion of the investigation that uncovered all these deficiencies congress should publish all findings and recommend that dhs approach airline security in a manner that is both effective for our nations security and respects the freedom and liberty of innocent travelers

8626403 reducing health inequities is an ethical imperative social injustice is killing people on a grand scale
8626404 there is no good biological reason why this should be the case
8626405 these health inequalities are preventable they arise from the circumstances in which people are born grow live work and age the social determinants of health
8626406 taking action to deal with preventable causes of illness means taking social action a toxic combination of poor social policies unfair economic arrangements and bad politics is responsible
8626407 the commission considers health care a common good not a market commodity
8626408 the commission advocates financing the health care system through general taxation and or mandatory universal insurance the evidence is compellingly in favour of a publicly funded health care system
8626409 we are distressed by the reports we see of healthcare simply being unavailable to people because of inability to pay and we see that throughout lower and middle income countries
8626410 not for me to tell one of the richest countries on earth how it should organise its health care system
8626411 its not perhaps the best use of money thats being spent there are a lot of people who feel that and would actually like to see coming out of the current presidential campaign in the us proposals for a universal health insurance
8626412 high quality detailed overview of soa security standards and approaches well thought out and structured presentation
8626413 the knowledge and transfer was a great baseline and with the additional resources gunnar made available made this one of the best one day classes ive taken
8626414 this class was a thorough and well organized trek through the current web services security landscape going beyond just describing the standards and the options available in the web services security world this class discusses real world use cases and offers implementable solutions best practices even vendor choices in several key areas this class provided me with actionable tasks that i took back to my project teams the very next day
8626415 the class was distinctly focused on security requirements and the strength and weaknesses of the various solution approaches we could consider the result of the course was actionable approaches to providing security in our soa environment
8626416 anyone who wants up to date information on soa security security standards and best practices should take this class
8626417 topics addressed are timely and relevant labs are hands on and help see concepts in action
8626418 this class was concise and covered a majority of the problem set my company is looking at and dealing with
8626419 excellent two day overview of security topics as related to web services
8626420 issue affecting most of us today amp for those that dont will soon very necessary education and technology
8626421 great class effective and relevant teaching in an area without much guidance
8626422 the class cut through jargon to communicate concepts and implementation details
8626423 good overview regarding soa security contains new technology like amqp and rest
8626424 the course covered what i had to learn about web services
8626425 presenter has very broad and deep technical knowledge on subject
8626426 good to learn where our application is vulnerable to attacks and how we can avoid them

8626428 gave a good overview of the web services security environment
8626429 lots of good technical information about an emerging area thats very useful
8626430 this class reinforced the importance of software security assurance to me as it lucidly demonstrated why being behind the firewall is an outdated concept
8626431 the area of soa security is complicated and youg a course such as this helps bring it into focus
8626432 web services security class provided application security concepts valuable for applications audits
8626433 good overview of techniques worth considering when planning secure apps
8626434 gives ideas about the latest web services security standards in the industry
8626435 class cleared up various ws standards and gave great concrete examples of how to build a message using each standard very good general thoughts on security groups role in it
8626436 i found this very useful as an it architect in a
8626437 lots of useful information packed in a small amount of time good overall picture
8626438 gunnar is very knowledgeable about security topics and has a great ability to explain complex ideas using simple appropriate and amusing language and analogies

8626444 the skull is about three important elements of life money fame and death only sex is missing money because of the platinum and the diamonds used on the skull fame because the work is just as famous as vermeers milk maid and it is the artist who creates an image which makes him famous and finally the skull denotes death i think its good and quite beautiful really exquisite diamonds and platinum it is expressed very succinctly in the skull that fame and beauty this is why it is so expensive no im not jealous we dont have it we would not have been able to put it on display the stedelijk museum is temporarily closed for renovation ed i would not have bought it the idea in itself is so beautiful you do not have to own everything you think is good
8626445 a work of art always sparks controversy when a lot of money is involved people will say the money could have been spent on much better things is it provocative it fits with his oeuvre i have no problems with it hirst has set the tune both in terms of content and marketing strategies he copied that from andy warhol major artists have a good sense of the political economic and social climate hirst rose to prominence in the thatcher era when the uk was deeply disillusioned he provided a new lan for the love of god is about universal value like life and death to this hirst links a decadence this world is ailing from it contains 20 to 25 million euros worth of diamonds but its worth 50 to 70 million are hirsts works beautiful well no but they are good they will become the style icons of our time
8626446 its more excitement more being ready to get the season going ive been playing for a while now the nerves arent as big as the excitement and the hope that we can go out there and do some big things
8626447 last year ben mauk got the opportunity and he made the best of it

8626452 ive already seen how this town will embrace a successful program if you put a good product on the field and you win
8626453 improving weather in the u s was helpful in getting caught up on water projects which were slowed in the first quarter mineral exploration activity continued strong throughout most regions despite an early rainy season in west africa higher natural gas pricing and an increased number of well completions kept layne energy on a steady upward track
8626454 i just find east austin visually stimulating and inspiring it all began with that little yard full of old campers blanking on where it is right now i stumbled across it and loved the visual the collection i spurred a and from there i built off of that inspiration using other beautiful things in east austin my physical surroundings have a big influence on my life naturally and i suppose that influence manifested in this form

8626456 weve seen a shift from card present fraud to card not present to fraud abroad
8626457 its not difficult to take compromised cards from one country and exploit them in another its a simple and routine procedure for these guys these days
8626458 they do not normally cash out in the same country
8626459 just because it makes the law enforcement job that much harder
8626460 they will do it for you in india and china
8626461 if the card has not been reported as having been cloned yes it can go through
8626462 i live in arizona and just received my new issue of dwell in the mail
8626463 the presidents reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of respect for historic and cultural traditions of every country and efforts aimed at preserving the unity of a state and its territorial integrity
8626464 placing the emphasis exclusively on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a comprehensive settlement of local conflicts
8626465 serious signal for those who are trying to justify the aggression
8626466 the sight of russian tanks in a neighboring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8626467 was not a step taken lightly or without full consideration of the consequences

8626469 on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8626470 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8626471 like millions of americans theyre asking questions as profound as they are ordinary
8626472 it was because i was so bright i couldnt get the thoughts out quickly enough
8626473 she told me joey god sends no cross you cannot bear and when i triumphed she was quick to remind me it was because of others
8626474 my mothers creed is the american creed no one is better than you you are everyones equal and everyone is equal to you
8626475 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8626476 we are trying to elaborate a strong text that will show our determination not to accept what is happening in georgia
8626477 i dont want to talk about sanctions myself ahead of time when the meeting itself has not taken place but we are working with our 26 partners at this moment
8626478 i say they will certainly be suggested certain countries have already asked that sanctions be imposed
8626479 france is not in favour of cutting relations with russia this will be solved by negotiation we need time were under no illusion about that
8626480 i think its a mistake on the part of a company to think that simply because they enroll that they are going to be protected from any kind of government audit or raid
8626481 howard industries runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants

8626488 its great news for more than one reason what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see
8626489 hes done everything for this organization they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8626490 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in
8626491 if you insist on a quick answer youre probably going to get the answer you dont want if you insist on an answer now it might be no if you give me more time it might be yes
8626492 teams asked if they could at least submit an offer for consideration and joe told me to advise teams not to bother
8626493 peter would like to play if his health will permit him right now hes working on his health issues related to his foot and theres nothing new on that
8626494 it hasnt progressed to the point where were in serious discussions with the team
8626495 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8626496 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8626497 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8626498 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8626499 he is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8626500 i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter i feel no need to publicly defend my role in s life im just sorry that she likes me more than him

8626510 kosovo citizens thought that arab states would take the lead among states in recognising kosovo
8626511 kosovo has no real foreign policy and has no vision on this issue
8626512 kosovo is working intensively on its recognition process and this conference helps kosovo
8626513 recognition of the independence of kosovo will help strengthen the cultural relationship between kosovo and arab states
8626514 it is very dangerous there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for russia in particular the crimea ukraine and moldova
8626515 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8626516 ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia
8626517 russia also cannot stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbours so it purposely created tension in the region
8626518 reiterated the decision taken by nato heads of state and government at the bucharest summit regarding georgias and ukraines euro atlantic aspirations
8626519 according to un security council resolution 1244 this territory is a territory of serbia and its violent secession from the rest of the country is unacceptable
8626520 russia had mentioned a series of countries that sold weapons to georgia and it sees nothing wrong in the move otherwise we would have taken diplomatic action
8626521 the us government continues to support the un sponsored negotiation process and wishes the issue to be solved as soon as possible all allegations that the united states is following different policies are groundless

8626530 it does what it says on the tin quite frankly and none of the games require super pcs they all run on low spec pcs and theyre all very easy to get into and get the hang of
8626531 were really excited about it and it should be a fantastic range for us
8626532 weve launched games that are deemed to be casual games before now the genre is more recognised weve come up with a generic umbrella range
8626533 white label has been hugely successful and we see that as our hardcore brand while click and play will complement it as our casual brand
8626534 kids can enjoy them but the core casual gaming audience is older and female which bucks the trend for pc gaming so it taps into as broad an audience as possible
8626535 the event shows just how varied innovative and exciting our forthcoming line up is
8626536 we are making games that the whole family can enjoy playing together the press response has been overwhelmingly positive and it is good to see so many people singing dancing and having fun
8626537 its fun its rewarding just to know that you did your little to help nature out
8626538 it may never be necessary it may be possible that just through constant iteration were able to keep the game looking fresh enough
8626539 for us usability is a lot more important we want to make sure that our game runs very well on low system specs

8626545 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8626546 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8626547 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8626548 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8626549 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need

8626556 given the uncertain recovery we have also lowered 2009 estimates and adjusted price targets
8626557 caution is warranted if investing in these names as volatility remains intense
8626558 is still a few quarters away as we anticipate additional asset sales and write downs in coming quarters throughout the financial services sector
8626559 its still in the preliminary stage we are not quite negotiating the trade agreement but certainly preparing the ground looking for areas where we can develop commonalities
8626560 the process is going quite well we continue to work and continue to meet
8626561 its just the preliminary exploratory stage in order to go to the next step of negotiating the free trade agreement
8626562 there is a framework in place they have agreed on the schedules of discussions and they are exploring possibilities on various sectors and various approaches but because of the diversity on both sides the two sides working very very hard to find some common ground to move forward

8626571 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel
8626572 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat
8626573 terrorism destroying israel those arent serious threats obama dangerously unprepared to be president
8626574 and ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the berlin wall
8626575 now that has to be the kind of approach that we take you know iran they spend one one hundredth of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance and we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen that doesnt mean we agree with them on everything we might not compromise on any issues but at least we should find out other areas of potential common interest and we can reduce some of the tensions that has caused us so many problems around the world
8626576 he doesnt remember how many houses he ownes any more
8626577 and yet we were willing to talk to the soviet union at the time when they were saying were going to wipe you off the planet
8626578 if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance
8626579 if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance
8626580 iran is a tiny country that doesnt pose a threat to us
8626581 obama belittled the threat from rogue states such as iran
8626582 when president bush took office in 2000 nk was very slowly building a highly enriched uranium cache
8626583 when the u s north korea nuclear agreement was signed in geneva in 1994 the u s intelligence authorities already believed north korea had produced plutonium enough for at least one nuclear weapon
8626584 because on this planet reducing the u s population by 1 3 would be beyond the capabilities of all but the following countries 1 the u s 2 russia 3 china 4 canada im uncertain as to the size of their nuclear arsenal but its probably big enough
8626585 the only fault of obama is that he does not like to come out with stupid but quick and strident sounding quotes
8626586 biden has mortgages and kids colleges to pay for like many other americans who are working hard to get ahead
8626587 iran has zero nuclear weapons and zero missles capable of reaching the us
8626588 iran they spend one one hundredth of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance
8626589 their campaign tactics make their trickle down from the top economic philosophy look innovative
8626590 if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance
8626591 tell your people to never leave nato we know what is like to have the germans and the french and the italians invade us you are the restraining force
8626592 strong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries thats what kennedy did with khrushchev
8626593 anyway as obama should know the kennedy khrushchev meetings were a total failure
8626594 i mean think about it iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8626595 the soviet union went to extreme length as did we to cast our nuclear forces as
8626596 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed its fine with me and i hope it would be fine with you if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al qaeda is training recruiting equipping and motivating people every single day
8626597 i mean think about it iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8626598 anyway as obama should know the kennedy khrushchev meetings were a total failure and brought us to the brink of nuclear war they did not prevent it
8626599 but obama smearing mccains wife for her wealth is okay after obama said that spouses should be off limits in campaigns that is a huge flip flop and lie
8626600 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8626601 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8626602 if shes not a strong enough leader to get her followers to do whats right for america then that would surprise me
8626603 they are going to say he has a funny name and did you hear hes black
8626604 here is the mccain clinton answer yes iran is a serious threat
8626605 they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8626606 they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8626607 iran would be much more vigilant i would bet in actually detonating one
8626608 it tells me that biden cant be trusted with the economy because he cant even handle his own finances
8626609 i mean think about it iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8626610 he chooses a vp who takes gobs and gobs of money from lobbyists
8626611 if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance
8626612 at one time the soviet union maintained the largest nuclear arsenal in the world according to estimates by the natural resources defense council the peak of approximately 45 000 warheads 5 was reached in 1986 roughly 20 000 of these were believed to be tactical nuclear weapons reflecting the red army doctrine that favored the use of these weapons if war came in europe the remainder approximately 25 000 were strategic icbms these weapons were considered both offensive and defensive in nature
8626613 isnt this similiar to the out of context soundbite obama is using against mccain where the ad has mccain saying the economy is in good shape
8626614 iran is the real victor in iraq and the world must now learn to live with a nuclear iran the way we learned to live with a nuclear soviet union and a nuclear china we israelis have what it takes to deter an iranian attack we are in no danger at all of having an iranian nuclear weapon dropped on us
8626615 obama doesnt handle criticism well he fights back like a spoiled teenager
8626616 at one time the soviet union maintained the largest nuclear arsenal in the world according to estimates by the natural resources defense council the peak of approximately 45 000 warheads 5 was reached in 1986 roughly 20 000 of these were believed to be tactical nuclear weapons reflecting the red army doctrine that favored the use of these weapons if war came in europe the remainder approximately 25 000 were strategic icbms these weapons were considered both offensive and defensive in nature
8626617 the obamians think that north korea blowing up a cooling tower is
8626618 obamas strategy is not different then what bush tried in 2005
8626619 the fact that an oil rich nation such as iran feels the need to have 6000 centrifuges
8626620 is anyone arguing with this are you suggesting that iran would stand a chance against the american military
8626621 if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance
8626622 exactly and it is obvious to the entire world that the us has decayed and crumbled economically and militarily thats why russia is thumping its nose at us over georgia thats why china is thumping its nose at us over sudan
8626623 obama was equating size of country with size of threat canada is larger in area than the usa
8626624 every empire in history has decayed and crumbled from within
8626625 we simply cant afford to bully other nations every empire in history has learned that lesson
8626626 then why has obama said hed meet with ahmadinejad specifically
8626627 obama was arguing that we should sit down with iran because it isnt really a threat to us
8626628 irans highest official in government is a supreme leader currently the supreme leader of iran is ali khamenei the role of president in iran is more like the vp in the us
8626629 i think the media should call mccain a liar play his ad and then play the recording of obamas nuanced statement let the people decide
8626630 and it is people who do not understand nuance who get us into wars that is exactly why i would never vote for mccain
8626631 and ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the berlin wall
8626632 now that has to be the kind of approach that we take
8626633 i think if you asked any average american who the leader of iran is i think theyd know
8626634 according to obama we should be terrified of canada then
8626635 it just takes one nuke to spoil your whole day
8626636 so whats the implication of the ad that mccain wants to attack all those countries
8626637 and ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the berlin wall
8626638 now that has to be the kind of approach that we take
8626639 i mean think about it iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8626640 iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose a serious threat to us
8626641 that is not even close to obama saying iran is a
8626642 iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8626643 whether you like it or not history is on our side we will dig you in
8626644 do you think if americans were asked are you better off today than you were before george bush took office more than seven years ago what answer would they give
8626645 you can make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time
8626646 it has happened before but its not a frequent occurrence
8626647 we continually refine and update our procedures and do our best to protect the systems on the station

8626649 our expedition 17 crew on the station is working with flight control and engineering teams and with our international partners to identify and eradicate the virus thats on board and well look for any actions we can take to prevent that from happening again

8626721 a lot of the compromised web sites run on joomla so that is a likely attack vector

8626723 its a trend thats very popular in some areas and it will grow across the country
8626724 and its all about the high costs of processing credit cards
8626725 when gas prices were at their peak this summer both consumers and station owners were hurt the most
8626726 the owners were squeezed by the oil companies and the credit card fees so a lot of them said to consumers pay us with cash and well both save money
8626727 im cutting down expenses and not using credit cards so if i see a station thats offering a cash discount i go for it
8626728 i just patronize stations that have low prices i like not having to search for a mobil or shell station because those are the cards i used
8626729 americans are increasingly relying on credit cards for purchases at the pump
8626730 a nickel discount on gas thats nearly 4 per gallon is unlikely to outweigh the convenience security and speed of paying by credit
8626731 people often pay a 35 to 45 cent fee for using a debit card
8626732 if youre filling up your tank with 20 gallons thats one thing but if youre just buying five gallons thats a big surcharge

8626738 weve seen a shift from card present fraud to card not present to fraud abroad
8626739 its not difficult to take compromised cards from one country and exploit them in another its a simple and routine procedure for these guys these days
8626740 they do not normally cash out in the same country
8626741 just because it makes the law enforcement job that much harder

8626747 in recent months we have learned that driver variability makes more difference in fuel efficiency than biodiesel utilization does
8626748 this new information is exciting because we already know that biodiesel offers a fleet of many added benefits beyond fuel efficiency
8626749 biodiesel acts as an engine lubricant biodiesel offers significantly higher cetane numbers reduces harmful emissions and adds national fuel production and biodiesel offers a fleet the opportunity to market itself as a green transporter to todays environmentally conscience corporations
8626750 although both the petroleum and b20 groups experienced some fuel filter plugging in zero degree fahrenheit weather the b20 trucks did not experience any considerable challenges because test partners implemented proper handling and storage measures

8626801 the fbi shouldnt have the unreviewable power to impose gag orders on the recipients of national security letters
8626802 as the district court ruled the fbis power to silence the recipients of these letters has to be subject to judicial oversight without that check the fbi can use its power to hide abuses and silence its critics and thats exactly what its been doing
8626803 this amendment violates not only the first amendments strong presumption in favor of free speech but also impermissibly limits the capacity of courts to behave as courts and to adjudicate fairly the propriety of any gag order

8626828 large scale exports of fresh water would be a wealth creating idea for quebec and all of canada its urgent to look seriously at developing our blue gold
8626829 canadas precious fresh water resource belongs to the people and cannot be bundled and privatized at the whim of government and corporate interests
8626830 water is a fundamental human right and any attempt to divert or export it whether to the u s or saudi arabia must defer to whats in the broad canadian public interest
8626831 in a pre election cycle theres great pressure from corporations to allow the export of fresh water if quebec went ahead other provinces would have to follow
8626832 my bill was intended as a safety measure before a water crisis blows up ill bring it back if theres an election but 90 per cent of canadas fresh water is under provincial control and that complicates things
8626833 we began the study months ago and it is a follow up to the one we did last year on the privatization of hydro qu bec we dont really know how much fresh water we have or whether exporting it would make economic sense but weve got to think about it and be ready if the issue comes to the boil further down the road
8626834 they are politically charged of course and i dont see the government acting at present

8626843 is a very good turn of events for the city of pittsburgh
8626844 has been a sort of cavalier and ford centric individual and hasnt really been thinking about the good of the city
8626845 but that vision never materialized and as i have always said where there is no vision people perish i have no desire to perish along with luke ravenstahls pittsburgh
8626846 the way contracts are supposed to be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder and the way contributions have been made to the mayor i think its self evident
8626847 understanding the actual requirements mctish kunkel submitted a bid lower than the other responsive bidder
8626848 any time we see a situation where contracts are being awarded to anyone other than the lowest responsible bidder there ought to be a reason
8626849 goes much further than pat ford pittsburgh is no longer a city that is open for business pittsburgh is a city for sale
8626850 contributive efforts are better because you are not relying on one individual

8626855 our batting has let us down disappointed the way we played we had opportunities but we have not utilised but one day cricket cannot be predicted and is about opportunities overall performance with the bat has been inconsistent

8626858 were trying to reach out to a very specific audience the people who dont read us often enough now readers in the 30 49 age group time starved readers occasional readers these people tell us they dont have enough time to read the paper that they have trouble finding the content theyre interested in and dont want to work so hard to find it so we really focused on things like navigation readability and opening up the spacing for more of an easy to read feeling the thought is that if we can get these people to read us just once or twice a week more than they do now that would add up to a big impact every decision has been made with readers in mind in an effort to make the paper easier and more fun to read if weve done our job well enough and kept our focus on the reader experience id like to think the recoiling in horror should be kept to a minimum
8626859 look we understand that some people dont like change and there is a certain segment of any audience including ours made up of traditional readers they might have been fine with or even preferred for us to just keep doing things the same old way but by almost any measure you use circulation readership focus groups whatever what were doing now is not working for enough people to me the scariest thing of all is not changing because theres no doubt thats a road to failure
8626860 i also personally reject the idea that a newspaper has to be dense and boring in order to deliver the news the sunsentinel has lots of great content we dont apologize for making it easier for readers to enjoy it or for presenting it in a visually sophisticated way
8626861 but were really just trying to do a better job giving readers what they tell us they want
8626862 readers keep telling us they dont have time for the paper shouldnt we do something to make it feel a little faster and easier to use
8626863 time after time focus groups tell us they werent even aware of something in the paper that they would have been very interested in should we ignore that and keep building dense pages so that we can feel good about cramming in as much as possible
8626864 but i have a legitimate non judgmental question for the pulp and for the other vocal neigh sayers who have slammed everything about this redesign what should a daily newspaper look like in 2008
8626865 just playing devils advocate here but it seems as if no one has liked any of the changes that the s s with or without hyphens has attempted during the previous couple of years either
8626866 if the s s has been getting things so wrong then what is the right approach
8626867 im just curious about what people think a contemporary newspaper should look like in the early 21st century
8626868 you wanted to know what a newspaper should look like in the early 21st century
8626869 and yes let us bow our heads and remember the days when the miami herald was almost as good as the washington post was say around the time of the miami riots in may 1980

8627158 with climate change and globalisation the ageing of the population is one of the major challenges europe must face
8627159 from 2015 onwards deaths would outnumber births and population growth due to natural increase would cease

8627168 councils across the country were criticised last month as it emerged that they used the regulation of investigatory powers act up to 10 000 times a year to investigate such petty offences as dog fouling and under age smoking
8627169 it is not right that we charge our police with combating crime and disorder and then tie their hands behind their backs the police should be given both the resources and the freedom to use those resources to do their job
8627170 lucentis is an expensive drug costing more than 20 000 for each eye treated
8627171 but that cost needs to be balanced against the likely cost savings
8627172 studies have also demonstrated that patients with visual impairment tend to have longer hospitalisations make greater use of health and community care services and are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes
8627173 it has been estimated that the costs related to sight impairment for patients treated with lucentis are around 16 000 cheaper than for patients who receive best supportive care over a 10 year period our guidance means that patients who are suitable for this treatment will have the same access to it irrespective of where they live
8627174 nices guidance will finally bring an end to a cruel postcode lottery
8627175 those responsible for nice should be aware that during the cumbersome two year review process 152 pcts have individually had the power to decide whether to let patients go blind or to save their sight
8627176 many hundreds of vulnerable patients have been subjected to an appalling emotional rollercoaster ride for the past two years during which many of them have lost their remaining sight
8627177 an innovative approach which shows how pharmaceutical companies can work together with nice and the department of health to ensure patients do get access to treatments on the nhs
8627178 wet amd is a debilitating eye condition that can result in a rapid loss of sight if left untreated
8627179 rapid implementation of the guidance is now needed to ensure that patients receive the treatment they need as soon as possible

8627220 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
8627221 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8627222 non leafy surroundings or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animals eyes
8627223 animals outside of leafy environments do not have to deal with clutter no matter how big or small they are so there is never any x ray advantage to forward facing eyes for them
8627224 because binocular vision does not help them see any better than monocular vision they are able to survey a much greater region with sideways facing eyes
8627225 this x ray vision makes it possible for animals with forward facing eyes to visually survey a much greater region around themselves than sideways facing eyes would allow
8627226 additionally the larger the animal in a cluttered environment the more forward facing its eyes will be to allow for the greatest x ray vision possible in order to aid in hunting running from predators and maneuvering through dense forest or jungle
8627227 in todays world humans have more in common visually with tiny mice in a forest than with a large animal in the jungle we arent faced with a great deal of small clutter and the things that do clutter our visual field cars and skyscrapers are much wider than the separation between our eyes so we cant use our x ray power to see through them
8627228 if we froze ourselves today and woke up a million years from now its possible that it might be difficult for us to look the new human population in the eyes because by then they might be facing sideways

8627255 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care

8627257 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
8627258 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

8627262 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

8627274 we would like the membership at the next meeting to approve the plan as a working document
8627275 to identify the significant social natural and physical features that make the lake and surrounding area a desirable place for people to live and visit
8627276 the long term sustainability and healthy existence of the lake for future generations
8627277 building mass and coverage should be limited in relation to the size and frontage of the property and the character of the surrounding area
8627278 people didnt want to be told how to do something
8627279 and we are looking at the full document as a membership plan that will be subject to change as we learn more its a starting point and the board is saying wed like to move forward on the things we can control
8627280 with a plan we have a hope of having an influence we can take control over what happens on the lake
8627281 and the only way to do that is to have some dialogue with them the idea is to influence the official plan to the degree to which it reflects the special requirements of waterfront property owners
8627282 and with surveying the membership on the recommendations weve got some feedback
8627283 we can revise the plan based on the feedback that we had and then what we want to do is make that public
8627284 an advocacy for very specific things as compared to the things we can manage better and are in control of and thats our voluntary work

8627528 la misma que tienen los empresarios yo espero que la presidenta bachelet reciba a los trabajadores como recibe a los empresarios que ella se vuelque a los trabajadores porque son los trabajadores los que la eligen a ella o al gobierno y no a los empresarios entonces as como ella va a casapiedra o como va a icare tambi n venga a los encuentros de los trabajadores
8627529 la presidenta se ha reunido no una sino que varias veces con la central unitaria de trabajadores as que desde ese punto de vista tal vez la informaci n est equivocada y desde el punto de vista de las propuestas m s espec ficas entiendo que podamos tener cr ticas desde el punto de vista de la intensidad del apuro de los ritmos pero del contenido espec fico creo que en eso hemos cumplido rigurosamente

8627537 the principle of presumption of innocence a very important constitutional principle and right has been twisted and presented by political rhetoricians to mean that one is indeed innocent without going through the judicial process
8627538 as a result of this misinformation and social engineering ordinary people are now convinced that jacob zuma is innocent
8627539 not only is such a general amnesty a call for impunity for those who may have been involved in criminal activities it is also an indirect statement that the judiciary is not trusted to determine the truth of guilt or innocence of alleged criminal wrongdoers

8627547 st andrews is a leader in the study of those subjects housed within this impressive new building it is fitting that the staff and students involved should have an appropriate home but the building being opened today also helps to demonstrate the international role that is played by the university of st andrews we are pleased to be an institution that projects scotland onto the world stage

8627578 i left around 8 50pm to pick my daughter up from passmores she was with a group of friends as i came out of my turning i noticed three red lights in the sky and as i turned the corner there were about five more all in a line
8627579 the sky was clear and these were not aeroplanes they didnt move or flash when i got to where my daughter was the first thing she asked me was did you see them there were many others who were out pointing up at the sky

8627582 our policies are clear and we ve communicated to our associates that if anyone representing our company gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval we believe that if the fec looks into this they will find what we ve known all along that we did nothing wrong the real issue here is protecting the rights of individuals to cast a private ballot when voting and we re opposed to the card check bill because it removes that right when it comes to unionization

8627585 jamie and i have done the research and figured that the only way to end the debate about the myth of the apollo moon landing is to go there
8627586 we built a hybrid rocket that was fueled by poo and nitrous oxide thought we had enough teflon tape on the seals but the stink got through anyway too bad that the footage got lost in transit to the editors
8627587 we looked at the ones that for some reason or other seemed most prevalent
8627588 the key idea was that the footage that proved we were there was a special effect adam and i are experienced effects artists so it was natural for us to dig into it
8627589 we wanted to tackle the ones that actually take some experimentation to prove
8627590 i was actually first involved with the mythbusters early on when i was contacted by one of their producers asking if i had any astronomical myths for them to bust
8627591 i made some suggestions but sadly they didnt use any of them
8627592 i guess most of them dont make very good tv
8627593 i hadnt heard anything about this show so i fired off an e mail to adam savage and said what gives
8627594 over the course of a few days they were on the phone with me and a lot of other people who knew about for example the properties of the lunar surface to try to figure out not just the best way of debunking the moon hoax but the best aspects of it so they wanted to know which ones that they had found were the ones that i ran into and what were the best ways to tackle them it was actually a lot of fun

8627620 we previously know that amyloid production is a symptom of stress that leads to cell death in type 2 diabetes perhaps the same thing happens in a transplant when cells are exposed to great stress
8627621 seit den 70er jahren gab es eine lebhafte fachliche debatte ber die funktionsweise der plasmen die jedoch zu keinem abschlie endem ergebnis gef hrt hat insbesondere die exakte mechanismus der energieeinkopplung ist nicht vollst ndig verstanden

8627641 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8627642 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8627643 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8627644 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8627645 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8627670 this year ive basically done what i knew i could do and i know i can do a lot more you never stop learning and you should keep improving each year
8627671 its a gradual build up hopefully for the next four or five years of playing my best rugby
8627672 its been an accumulation of things that have come together maturing as a person and realising what ive got to do to achieve my goals
8627673 it was a change of club a change of coach and a change of position which is what i always wanted to do
8627674 ive not achieved all my goals yet in all the big games i played in for bradford i wasnt the dominant part of the team i wanted to be
8627675 this saturday i will go there as a key figure in the team somebody the guys rely on to play
8627676 thats always what i wanted to do to be that player your team mates rely on to pull you out of sticky situations by scoring a match winning try
8627677 i want to be playing the full game in a pivotal role and not coming off the bench for 15 or 20 minutes thats not me i dont want to look back on my career and be remembered as a guy who came on for 10 and 15 minutes
8627678 thats why i want to stay in rugby league and finish what ive started
8627679 ill be at saints for the next two to three years which im contracted for and in that time i want to dominate my position and dominate super league
8627680 i still feel i have got things to prove in rugby league and i see my future at saints
8627681 i would by lying if i said i wasnt worried about it because thats natural
8627682 but that will take care of itself i want to just try and concentrate on my rugby
8627683 its a big year for me rugby wise and i want to stay focused on that and finish the year in the right way for saints and hopefully for england
8627684 i want to win things its been a really good year so far but ive not won anything yet
8627685 i like to be the underdog when nobody gives you a chance it spurs you on and i think that will probably give hull the edge just like when sheffield beat wigan and when saints beat us in 1999 when we were favourites at bradford

8628155 this is something ive wanted so long and now all the emotions are crowding in on me for our race the fleet crowded the weather end of the line and i heard at least one boat called over early as we started i was right next to her and i wasnt going to take any chances so i went back too along with a couple of other boats
8628156 i had a tough first beat and knew i had to pull something out to get back on top most of the fleet had gone right but i got into this line of breeze and headed out to the left along with the two sailors ahead of me who ultimately won the silver and the bronze i kept going further out until we sailed into this massive left shift i was overstood and actually had to reach into the mark as i got closer to the mark i could see with certainty with every yard i was gaining and picking off my competition
8628157 the shift had turned the run into a reach after i rounded in third place i knew i had the gold in my grasp the finish line couldnt arrive soon enough as i got the gun i was so happy and so proud to win for my country it was overwhelming

8628169 this is the most comprehensive free trade agreement that asean has ever entered it is the largest free trade agreement that australia has ever negotiated
8628170 the ministers see the agreement as paving the way to enhancing the regions economic integration and acting as an impetus to deepen and broaden the trade and investment among the 12 participating countries
8628171 we hope to build on that at the same time our dialogue partners are negotiating ftas among themselves and so this is going to be a network of ftas and it will be ideal if we can put this all together in the next stage

8628177 we cannot come to a meaningful solution on climate change without coming to grips with the question of deforestation
8628178 there is a real risk of africa becoming the forgotten continent in the context of the fight against climate change unless we manage to design a regime going into the future that takes into account in a much more comprehensive way what africas specific needs are not only on adaptation but also on fuelling clean economic growth
8628179 acceding to the optional protocol demonstrates the rudd governments positive re engagement with the united nations after many years of inaction on a number of important international instruments
8628180 if australia is to be taken seriously when it comes to international human rights then its important that we impose on ourselves the same high standards we expect of our neighbours
8628181 the government received a high number of positive responses from womens groups and community organisations
8628182 by signing up to the optional protocol australia places itself as a global leader when it comes to womens rights

8628190 gerrard will have an operation tomorrow on a groin problem we knew this would happen he had a problem and now he will have an operation and he will be out for 10 or 15 days its not a big problem but he had pain and it was difficult
8628191 the injury wasnt affected by the period of extra time when he went away with
8628192 he was playing with pain before and he kept going today because he knew he was going to see the surgeon tomorrow its not serious its a minor operation but we needed to do it
8628193 we knew it would be difficult because they played well in the first game and we had to work really hard until the end for me the most positive thing is we played a little bit better against a good team who are sharp now we scored right at the end that showed the team was working really hard
8628194 when you play these kind of games the other team is playing and training just thinking about this game but we have been bringing in players from things like the

8628198 i think its fantastic i like the traditional kits i think we should wear kits that represent the history of the club and this one certainly does that
8628199 when you look at the final image you will associate it with the great team of 1968 with the likes of george best and bobby charlton
8628200 obviously they won the european cup in blue so we hope we can walk in their shoes again with this kit its such a big part of the history of the club
8628201 its a nice kit its been designed to celebrate 40 years since the european cup win so its great to have a kit that remembers that team
8628202 when you come to a club like united the history of the club is something that is important for new players to understand its different to go out in blue but its all part of the clubs history and i think thats important
8628203 this club has a great history we respect the legends and its great for us to put a shirt on that remembers a great team i think its beautiful

8628217 my research suggests theyre not the t rex of the sea they get more docile as they mature a strange phenomenon that has caught scientists off guard
8628218 we are looking at something verging on the incredibly bizarre as she got older she got shorter and broader and was reduced to a giant gelatinous blob carrying many thousands of eggs
8628219 her shape was likely to have affected her behaviour and ability to hunt i cant imagine her jetting herself around in the water at any great speed and she was too gelatinous to have been a fighting machine
8628220 its likely she was just blobbing around the seabed carrying her brood of eggs living on dead fish while her mate was off hunting
8628221 you only get one chance to make a first impression
8628222 the comparison of value in one period with value in a later period is no scholastic illusion but rather forms the fundamental principle of the circulation process of capital
8628223 if we conceive society as being not capitalistic but communistic there will be no moneycapital at all in the first place not the disguises cloaking the transactions arising on account of it
8628224 in capitalist society however where social reason always asserts itself only post festum great disturbances may and must constantly occur
8628225 the effective demand rises without itself furnishing any element of supply hence a rise in the prices of productive materials as well as means of subsistence a band of speculators contractors engineers lawyers etc enrich themselves they create a strong demand for articles of consumption on the market wages rising at the same time a portion of the reserve army of labourers which keep wages down is absorbed a general rise in wages ensues even in the hitherto well employed sections of the labour market this lasts until the inevitable crash again releases the reserve army of labour and wages are once more depressed to their minimum and lower
8628226 the cycle of interconnected turnovers embracing a number of years in which capital is held fast by its fixed constituent part furnishes a material basis for the periodic crises during this cycle business undergoes successive periods of depression medium activity precipitancy crisis true periods in which capital is invested differ greatly and far from coincide in time but a crisis always forms the starting point of large new investments therefore from the point of view of society as a whole more or less a new material basis for the next turnover cycle
8628227 the credit system appears as the main lever of over production and over speculation in commerce the reproduction process which is elastic by nature is here forced to its extreme limits the credit system accelerates the material development of the productive forces and the establishment of the world market at the same time credit accelerates the violent eruptions of this contradiction crises and thereby the elements of disintegration of the old mode of production
8628228 after the reproduction process has again reached that state of prosperity which precedes that of over exertion commercial credit becomes very much extended i
8628229 but those cavaliers who work without any reserve capital or without any capital at all and thus operate completely on a money credit basis begain to appear in considerable numbers to this is now added the great expansion of fixed capital in all forms and the opening of new enterprises on a vast and far reaching scale the interest now rises to its average level it reaches its maximum again as soon as the new crisis sets in
8628230 credit suddenly stops then the reproduction process is paralysed and a superabundance of idle industrial capital appears side by side with an almost absolute absence of loan capital
8628231 the industrial cycle is of such a nature that the same circuit must periodically reproduce itself once the first impulse has been given during a period of slack production sinks below the level which it had attained in the preceding cycle and for which the technical basis has now been laid during prosperity the middle period it continues to develop on this basis in the period of over production and exertion it strains the productive forces to the utmost until it exceeds the capitalistic limits of the production process
8628232 in a system of production where the entire continuity of the reproduction process rests upon credit a crisis must obviously occur a tremendous rush for means of payment when credit suddenly ceases and only cash payments have validity at first glance the whole crisis seems to be merely a credit and money crisis but the majority of these bills bills of exchange or invoices which cannot be converted into cash represent actual sales and purchases whose extension far beyond the needs of society is the basis of the whole crisis
8628233 the whole process becomes so complicated with a developed credit system that the semblance of a very solvent business with a smooth flow of returns can easily persist even long after returns actually come in only at the expense of swindled money lenders and partly of swindled producers thus business always appears almost excessively sound right on the eve of a crash business is always thoroughly sound and the campaign in full swing until suddenly the debacle takes place
8628234 it is a basic principle of capitalist production that money as an independent form of value stands in opposition to commodities or that exchange value must assume an independent form in money
8628235 secondly however credit money itself is only money to the extent that it absolutely takes the place of actual money to the amount of its nominal value
8628236 the replacement of the capital invested in production depends largely upon the consuming power of the non producing classes while the consuming power of the workers is limited partly by the laws of wages partly by the fact that they are used only as long as they can be profitably employed by the capitalist classes the ultimate reason for all real crises always remains the poverty and restricted consumption of the masses as opposed to the drive of capitalist production to develop the productive forces as though only the absolute consuming power of society constituted their limit
8628237 in proportion as the luxury part of the annual product grows as therefore an increasing share of the labour power is absorbed in the production of luxuries
8628238 that commodities are unsaleable means only that no effective purchasers have been found for them i
8628239 i want to give traditional crime novel readers a more immersive experience
8628240 offers publishing a chance to catch up with the youtube generation that has lost passion for reading
8628241 i personally dont have the attention economy to read a 250 page crime novel from start to finish
8628242 i realized that the way id like to consume a novel is to be rewarded every couple of chapters by seeing something visual that enhances the narrative
8628243 most of our people have never had it so good
8628244 the government must introduce legislation quickly to end the tremendous influx of people from the commonwealth overcrowding has fostered vice drugs prostitution and the use of knives for years the white people have been tolerant now their tempers are up
8628245 we dont want a colour bar of any sort we want an end to the thing which causes the colour bar the immigration of thousands of completely different people who take our homes and threaten our jobs
8628246 we organised a force to take home coloured people wherever they were living in the area we were not leaving our homes and going out to attack anyone but if you attacked our homes you would be met
8628247 i was standing on the second floor with the lights out as look out when i saw a massive lot of people out there i was observing the behaviour of the crowd outside from behind the curtains upstairs and they say lets burn the niggers lets lynch the niggers
8628248 but when they saw the molotov cocktails coming and they start to panic and run it was a very serious bit of fighting that night we were determined to use any means any weapon anything at our disposal for our freedom we were not prepared to go down like dying dogs
8628249 i saw a mob of over 700 men women and children stretching 200 yards along the road young children of ten were treating the whole affair as a great joke and shouting come on lets get the blacks and the coppers lets get on with it
8628250 in the middle of the screaming jeering youths and adults a speaker from the union movement was urging his excited audience to get rid of them
8628251 to people who had never before encountered racial conflicts claudia jones was able to console and prevent what some people thought would turn into a stampede of selling out and returning to the countries of their origin she had been through all this before
8628252 we are satisfied that it was the work of a group of about six anti law white teenagers who had only one motive in view robbery or attempted robbery
8628253 are to assist the payment of fines of coloured and white youths involved in the notting hill events
8628254 carnival was always seen by the state and the establishment as something that they wanted to stop because they saw it for what it was a form of cultural resistance
8628255 we will accept your diversity as long as you distance yourself from the radical and the anti social
8628256 i was surprised by the hostility we experienced as we arrived at tilbury docks
8628257 and for someone who was in the raf i was shocked because as colonials we had volunteered to fight for england
8628258 what the future population of the nation would look like
8628259 the black americans had a different experience from us they all served together the us army was racially segregated we were in mixed units
8628260 many english people saw a black face and thought we came from africa or were black americans we felt the british public were not very well informed about us
8628261 it was very hard for me as most of my family were opposed to our marriage
8628262 in the end we remained friends with those who accepted donald and just ignored those who had a problem
8628263 we were young at the time and felt it was two of us against the world
8628264 by then people got used to seeing black people and most english people began to realise that all the things the press accused us of that we would do bad things didnt happen
8628265 although i was often homesick i have no regrets about making the journey i tell young people today to stay committed to their dreams dont give up your goals
8628266 god and nature first made us what we are and then out of our own created genius we make ourselves what we want to be follow always that great law let the sky and god be our limit and eternity our measurement
8628267 its like when you get a seizure your muscles tighten up and they get a little bit sore
8628268 thats how i feel right now no pull nothing bad lets give it a little rest and see how it feels today
8628269 i wasnt going to do it again i knew that
8628270 whatever it took to make that last play i was going to do
8628271 the economic environment continued to negatively impact mobile phones sales in both mature and emerging markets
8628272 consumers in mature markets continued to favor mid tier devices over high end devices while new subscribers continued to join mobile networks in emerging markets during the quarter however replacement sales remained weak as consumers faced higher prices for fuel and food in addition to higher levels of inflation
8628273 today the european court of human rights ruled against mr mckinnons application for rule 39 interim relief
8628274 the temporary prohibition of our clients extradition as granted by the echr on 12 august is now effectively lifted and the authorities of the united kingdom are now free to extradite our client to the united states
8628275 in terms of legal challenges and court proceedings weve gone as far as we can
8628276 weve written to the secretary of state asking her to reconsider and keep mckinnon in the country
8628277 weve asked for two weeks to put the medical evidence before her
8628278 the optimal point is changing and going bigger is not the answer
8628279 turbines in the two or three megawatt zone are the most efficient and the best cost per kilowatt
8628280 i see a lot more technology going into each of the components especially the blades
8628281 the blades will look more funky and twisted to get better performance
8628282 were working on supply chain flexibility by providing different technology options
8628283 its all about having options at this point we will structure things to have all the raw materials at the right costs
8628284 obviously im delighted to come back to city and i just cant wait to get started again
8628285 to actually secure the deal and bring shaun back home is a fantastic coup for us and im sure the supporters will be just as excited as we are to have him back at manchester city
8628286 we have commissioned kpmg to do a report on the equestrian shooting and basketball venues looking at whether the olympic experience and the legacy they will provide represents value for money
8628287 when you take the costs for these venues it seems like a lot of money to a lot of people it is a sort of testing to destruction to see whether that spending can be justified
8628288 we can withstand any difficult conditions if we can topple samak
8628289 simply stated the court has given the government a sword but officials concerned will enforce the court order with caution
8628290 if we get arrested please dont follow us to the detention center
8628291 you must remain here and continue fighting if you leave the government house that means we have been defeated

8628305 cenas surgery wasnt as drastic or invasive as what some other wwe superstars have endured and one thing that helped was the quick response time of cena himself if john had ignored the symptoms this matter would have ended up an entire different story without the quick and positive results of tuesday

8628315 p hjus miks me need ettepanekud eile esitlesime on see et meile on p him tteliselt vastuv etamatu et valimislubaduste vastandamine eesti arengule reformierakond on oma valimislubadused v ga p hjalikult l bi kaalunud ja iga lubaduse realiseerimine teenib eesti arengut ja edu seet ttu ei saa me n ustuda nende inimestega kes tlevad et riigi arengu huvides tuleks valimislubadustest loobuda
8628316 oecd muutub ja ka statistikas ei ole meil staatilisi n udmisi uus suund on keskkonnastatistika ja biotehnoloogia
8628317 k ikide riikide statistikaametid peavad tegema pingutusi et ajaga kaasas k ia uus on keskkonnastatistika kuna poliitiline suund on keskkonnateadlikum vaja on ajakohasemat ja detailsemat infot teine suund on sotsiaalstatistika sissetulekud jne kuna hiskond muutub nii kiiresti ja elu kvaliteedi j rgimine on suur v ljakutse k igile statistikutele
8628318 k simus on alati aegridade j tkumises ja vajaduses v tta arvesse uus fenomene
8628319 kuna meie majandus ja hiskond muutub kiiresti peavad infotarbijad olema kannatlikud kuna statistika peab arenema et saaks n idata muutuvat majandust ideaalses maailmas arvutataks aegridade j tkuvuse p him ttel nii vana kui uute meetodite j rgi kuid kahjus on ressursid v ga piiratud see ei ole v imalik
8628320 see tendents on le maailmne sest tehnoloogia abil saab iga ks statistikat teha ja segaduse tekkimine on t sine oht olen t heldanud le maailma rimeeste kaubanduskodade jne marlaudade tekkimist et heskoos aru saada hiskonna arengust sellised hendused on austraalias usas itaalias ungaris prantsusmaal jne nad ritavad skpst kaugemale minna kuid siin on risk et tekib liiga palju numbreid ja inimesed ei p ra sellele enam t helepanu sest nad ei suuda infovoogu hallata peab leidma demokraatliku konsensuse
8628321 1200 osalejat 130 riigist tuli kokku et aidata hiskonnal aru saada kus see on ja kuhu liigub statistika fundamentaalne roll on anda usaldusv rset info kui poliitikud peavad otsustama mis on oluline
8628322 ei usu et probleem on liiga palju statistikat meil on statistikud ja meedia et aidata hallata info voogu ilma segadusse ajamata peame investeerima statistilisse kirjaoskusesse
8628323 statistika on teadus mis loodis selleks et riigi olukorrast levaadet saada t na peab saama levaate kogu hiskonnast seet ttu kutsuksin seda pigem sotsistikaks

8628352 the fast transport of these particles their low removal in the aquifer and the extensive nature of the highly porous zones of limestone suggest that chlorine resistant surface water pathogens pose potential threats to the drinking water withdrawn from the biscayne aquifer
8628353 the highly porous nature of the biscayne aquifer presents significant water management implications especially as it relates to the inadvertent release of contaminants within or immediately outside the well field protection area
8628354 this indicates that if a contamination event occurs in the biscayne aquifer that continues for days weeks or months it has the potential to degrade water quality and could persist from years to decades

8628363 the humanitarian concerns resulting from the south ossetia conflict needs to be addressed urgently by both parties
8628364 the nra is a formidable opponent and people are concerned about that
8628365 the reaction is positive but the idea is still new
8628366 the city was moving away from its traditional image of white heterosexual and male which puts off many gay and lesbian applicants
8628367 as a result the proportion of gay and lesbian workers began to increase
8628368 times changed and diversity became a watchword for human resources policy but it looks as though progress has stalled
8628369 two important things have happened city workers arent turning straight en masse
8628370 firstly people dont feel secure enough to identify themselves as gay at the moment even anonymously
8628371 this fits with our analysis of the impact age has on city workers willingness to identify themselves as gay
8628372 the second thing that has happened is age discrimination legislation we dont think the widening of the gay gap is just about candidates its also the result of a change of focus within city institutions
8628373 employers have turned their attention to age discrimination laws and the issue of sexuality has become less important
8628374 arguably the fact that sexuality is no longer seen as an issue in the city might not be such a bad thing
8628375 more of the older generation will identify themselves as gay once city workers reach a certain level in an organisation they feel confident enough to do so
8628376 but fewer young gay people are prepared to identify themselves as such its about feeling secure in your workplace
8628377 the credit crunch has made people feel less secure hence the falling numbers
8628378 they are acting like crazed control freaks the city council dont want us to raise awareness around several major concerns they would rather ignore collectively this years sponsors pretty much own all the gay media and local media
8628379 manchester pride is responsible for ensuring the content of the parade is in keeping with its position as a peaceful and celebratory march and this year was no different
8628380 no entrants were asked to withdraw any aspect of their promotional material and the parade was as always an understanding platform for all of us to raise awareness and promote equality for the lgbt community
8628381 pride is losing touch with what it was originally meant to be
8628382 the event is meant to be a celebration of our sexuality
8628383 a ticket charge means that young people and other underrepresented groups cant get into pride

8628448 the bloomberg financial newswire decided to update its 17 page steve jobs obituary on wednesday
8628449 bloomberg has retracted its obituary more interesting are the accompanying notes for bloomberg reporters which reveal that near the top of bloombergs list of people to call in event of his death is jobss ex girlfriend heidi roizen quite the valley switchboard apparently and california attorney general and like jobs cranky aging hippie jerry brown and jon rubinstein former head of apples ipod division now chairman at palm al gore bill gates and many more also bloomberg doesnt seem to have many peoples cell phone numbers
8628450 its not out of the ordinary at all that bloomberg would have this written all major news outlets have notable persons obituaries prepared in advance so that only minor changes need be made at the actual time of death that way the news can be reported almost immediately and can be updated with further detail but a jobs obituary however premature is more chilling than say a bill gates obituary
8628451 so given a ceo whose health has been discussed so speculatively in the echo chamber of the blogosphere and whose companys stock has been shown to be far from immune to the influence of the rumor mill the appearance however brief of a jobs obituary online must certainly have been disquieting for those who stumbled upon it
8628452 bloomberg released a retraction later on wednesday that made only the vaguest of reference to the content of the gaffe

8628477 the health inequities we see in the world are absolutely dramatic in their scale
8628478 between countries we have life expectancy differences of more than 40 years a woman in botswana can expect to live 43 years in japan 86 years
8628479 one of the recommendations in the commissions report is that there should be universal health care systems that are available to people regardless of ability to pay
8628480 virtually all advanced countries have universal health care systems but we dont think that should be limited to high income countries we think that could be much more broadly available
8628481 its not perhaps the best use of the money that is being spent and there are a lot people who feel that and would actually like to see coming out of the current campaign in the u s proposals for a universal health insurance
8628482 the importance of prevention continues to grow partly because of escalating health care costs we simply cannot afford the way we go about doing health care nowadays without tackling and doing more prevention

8628512 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8628513 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8628514 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that

8628525 theres still the end of year tour to come and we dont want to go on that trip thinking about whether we should change things or worry if things are working or not

8628557 quello di sapere ispirare la gente infondere la speranza guidarla verso un orizzonte pi alto ha lintelligenza e la curiosit che non possono mancare in un presidente ha mostrato di avere una chiara comprensione della politica estera delle sfide sul fronte della sicurezza nazionale e una ferma determinazione a rimettere in sesto le nostre forze armate

8628743 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8628744 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care and fighting for womens rights to see another republican in the white house squander our promise of a country that really fulfills the hopes of our people

8628770 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8628771 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

8628797 minority owned businesses have made significant contributions to the texas economy and have provided job opportunities to texans across the state
8628798 but like other small businesses across the country minority owned small businesses face a unique set of challenges
8628799 for these reasons i have pushed for reauthorization of the small business administration as sba deputy director carranza attested to today this bill has unfortunately been blocked for years by congressional leaders who have instead passed a series of temporary extensions among other important initiatives this bill would help minority business owners in san antonio gain access to more affordable loans congress must pass the sba reauthorization soon to help minority entrepreneurs weather economic challenges and succeed

8628816 if she loses her cell phone then well be able to find it and find her
8628817 it was more the rudeness of the people who owned the restaurant then anything else
8628818 we made a reservation for 25 they sat us and did a very inadequate job of serving us
8628819 theres a problem when a table of 25 hasnt even received an appetizer up to that point
8628820 it shouldnt have taken that long to cook our food no one had ordered anything complicated
8628821 when i came back in the owner of the restaurant and his wife were standing there and yelling at my brother
8628822 they were pointing their finger and telling him that if he didnt like it then we were welcome to leave the restaurant
8628823 my mom and my sister in law did place money on the table thinking that they did pay for the drinks
8628824 at the fiddlers green we were served by one waitress and one cook in 45 minutes it was absolutely amazing service and the waitress was sweet and courteous
8628825 i just thought that anyone who was going to serve us that day would know of the situation and have some sort of respect for my mom at that point
8628826 my mom got a bill from that restaurant on the following tuesday
8628827 it was for 38 and change to cover deep fried won tons and beverages that were brought to the table they took the 18 that was thrown on the table from us and my mom was charged 20 04

8628829 i was talking to amy to try to understand why she would do something like that
8628830 i understand they went through a hard time but it doesnt mean that you can displace your anger to my employees or ourselves
8628831 so that is why we went outside to talk to them
8628832 when they phoned in i already told them that it would be a long wait usually we dont make short reservations just because they had a father passed away and they wanted a family get together i done it
8628833 one of my girls then began to start taking their order even though the entire party was not there
8628834 then at 5 10 when everyone arrived the girls start taking orders for their drinks in five minutes the girls return to take their order of the food
8628835 the girls took eight minutes to take everyones order and to ensure it was right at 5 15 they were finished with orders and at 5 25 she put in the order to the kitchen
8628836 we are not a fast food restaurant we do the food order by order
8628837 everybody was having different meals as well but they were just waiting for their food less then half an hour
8628838 you have to assume there will be a long wait when we are busy
8628839 ive gone from a to z with all kinds of emotions but i feel great i feel thankful

8628843 there is a tremendous need in this district for roadwork for infrastructure for economic development to continue in this area because this district the past 40 or 50 years has been rich in the mining logging and fishing industry and has generated much wealth to this region and to the entire province i think its about time for our district to get more than our fair share
8628844 for me and my husband the donation was just a personal one
8628845 the donation came out of our own pocket because its such a good cause
8628846 my father has had throat cancer nine times i have had cervical cancer four times and my mom has lung cancer
8628847 we have gone through all this in the past 11 years with two parents and myself
8628848 ive heard that in daffodil place an overnight stay is a very low cost there are meals and transportation provided to patients so it is a very good cause
8628849 its hard enough to go through the disease let alone the financial burden as well
8628850 we are trying to challenge those who own fishing enterprises to meet or beat our amount and even if only two or three donate then it can help make a difference
8628851 we havent heard of anything here at our office or the other offices because we are usually kept up to date on donations and things
8628852 but we hope some people step up to the challenge because every little bit helps
8628853 construction has been underway since early this spring its really exciting and its moving along quickly
8628854 it was announced this week that they have reached the 5 million mark of 7 million
8628855 daffodil place will offer a place to stay that is affordable to most but there are also emotional and practical support programs on site
8628856 so if someone needs a wig while at daffodil place they can get one there free of charge if they need to talk to someone it is available at any time as well
8628857 we cant seem to find a cure but the daffodil place well help ease stress and is just heaven sent for some
8628858 this will be a model site capable of handling the breadth of products produced by cognis and the multiple sizes of packages they require

8628874 his achievements are proof of our continuing progress toward a more perfect union of our founders dreams
8628875 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8628876 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8628877 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8628878 to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare to candidate mccain
8628879 candidate mccain now supports the wartime tax cuts that senator mccain once denounced as immoral
8628880 candidate mccain says he would now vote against the immigration bill that senator mccain wrote
8628881 are you kidding talk about being for it before youre against it
8628882 when john mccain stood on the deck of an aircraft carrier just three months after 9 11 and proclaimed next up
8628883 how insulting to suggest that those who question the mission question the troops
8628884 how pathetic to suggest that those who question a failed policy doubt america itself
8628885 how desperate to tell the son of a single mother who chose community service over money and privilege that he doesnt put america first barack obamas patriotism
8628886 john kerry descended into a parody of himself tonight when he explained that he was actually for john mccain before he was against him
8628887 a few days ago i was speaking to a group and one young lady asked me what do you think dr king would say about
8628888 i think my most emotional moment came the night of south dakota and montana i was thinking about all those times i was telling people be what you want to be when you grow up and hell i didnt believe it its a big moment and with these sorts of things you usually dont expect to see the day
8628889 i dont think it will draw out latent racism because of the characteristics that define barack obama he is not a traditional he is a combo of african american and white i think america is at a place today where it is ready to move knowing that with its population balance shifting it is no longer about dominance by any particular one race
8628890 i think after iowa for the first time a lot of black people said wow this could happen
8628891 the reality is obamas not alone theres a wave of african american leaders who just excite i see in my own city people in their 20s who are just incredible just like the foray of blacks into baseball yeah there was a but after him there were dozens of players who changed the game there are glass ceilings that will be shattered in statehouses and party leadership positions obamas been a game changer
8628892 what this does for so many people of so many people of different colors and strides and stripe and genders is that if barack obama can do it anybody in this country can do it
8628893 i think that while it doesnt mean weve gotten to heaven we are on our way as the old song goes we are on the highway to a racial justice or at least towards eliminating race as a factor for putting people in political office in high places
8628894 its been a spiritual experience for me personally and i think its a spiritual movement that has taken the whole country
8628895 i was born in 1954 and in 1954 we would not be having this conversation so the fact that we have come to a place in our society where there are enough people willing to endorse through their votes financial support and a black male candidate is very significant in terms of how society has evolved
8628896 i dont think anyone looks at and thinks that this guy is speaking for black americans theres a danger that white people will say that the fact that barack obama is president means any black person can be president without any further reform of the system thats a big fear that his success will be used to reduced sympathies for those who did not succeed
8628897 as we mature in the political process we are developing a whole cadre of a new type of politician who wants to appeal more broadly to an entire society theyve got to appeal across the board thats just a sign to me of the maturing of the african american politician in this country
8628898 in spite of the fact that i might disagree ideological or politically i think its helpful for my daughter my 8 year old daughter asked me during my second term when we were getting sworn in she asked me daddy do you have women congressmen so i think there is a psychological benefit it is good to see an african american nominee for major political party now its not going to shock us as much no more than to see the female reporter or black quarterback or black republican or the hispanic head coach
8628899 barack obama is like the first african americans who ran for mayors of major american cities hes an extraordinary candidate
8628900 his candidacy is a reflection of its a fruit of the civil rights movement but the civil rights movement doesnt own him we may co own him we are maybe shareholders in his success
8628901 im 76 years old and i have participated in one aspect of the struggle or another since i was a teenager in high school after i grew up i understood that this wasnt an effort that you accomplished in one lifetime or one great magic movement as we held in the 1950s and 1960s it was long range project you know that you have to keep pushing and you know that you have to keep struggling and you dont know exactly how it will come out but you believe the struggle is worth it because you know there is more decency in the country then the status quo has it well i never back in the 60s i never pushed with the idea that sometime in my lifetime a black person would get to be it never occurred to me
8628902 barack obama has never been a black leader he is a leader that happens to be black he has never carried the black agenda the responsibility for african americans will be as if not more paramount to address these issues than before his campaign began
8628903 the country really has evolved and thats a wonderful thing who would have though four years ago that an african american man could be the nominee of the his nomination means it can happen and will happen likely in our lifetime
8628904 if there is someone who wore fate on his sleeve it is barack obama
8628905 you could see it happen you could feel it it was a matter of time
8628906 a leader that god has blesses us with at this time
8628907 barry was given a lesson that he would consume over and over his unique racial ancestry made him someone who certainly was not to be ostracized or shunned
8628908 in my case you had this person who was almost a myth in our family about how smart he was and how well he had done school and how well spoken he was
8628909 so that was something to live up to high expectations on the other hand heres somebody who wasnt there and that i would come to learn was an alcoholic someone who had not treated his family well and so that was something you felt you had to make up for
8628910 and even in times of self doubt obama has hearkened back to that wisdom
8628911 very much at the root of who barack has become
8628912 he realized people began to respond to him in a powerful way
8628913 he had this ability immediately you sit there and say this guy there is something special about him
8628914 no matter who met him or how you met him you walked away with that impression this guy is going places i think he will be president of the united states did i think he would become more than what he was at the time yeah he had this unique ability to make people feel comfortable around themselves and feel part of the process
8628915 if all goes well maybe he will be president of the united states
8628916 i also thought he likes people and people liked him i thought early on this was someone who could unify the country across political lines there was something about his lack of dogmatism and his problem solving ability and the ability to connect with him
8628917 so we were in the midst of one of our intensive discussions about civic engagement
8628918 and after one of these ranging discussions across the political sectors he did this tour de force summary
8628919 its true i give a good speech what can i do nothing wrong with that
8628920 who i am willing to sacrifice because we have this window of opportunity
8628921 be one of the most dynamic leaders we have seen in a long time
8628922 the thing i want to remind you is that everybody in this party knows that
8628923 you know why i say that because see before he was running right after that wonderful speech at the convention everybody wanted a piece of hope it wasnt naive then barack spent the entire fall traveling around campaigning and raising money for every single democratic race
8628924 ethanol is going to be costing you in the supermarket
8628925 because where people used to have wheat and rice growing in the field theyve all switched to corn now people are producing corn and turning it into ethanol the cost of cheese has gone up the cost of bread has gone up the cost of crackers has gone up everything has gone up
8628926 declared his intention to apply this formula on a world scale which means none other than the internationalisation of genocide
8628927 it is not often that this newspaper finds itself in agreement with fidel castro
8628928 the price of corn has a relatively low impact on the overall price of food because theres not that many products when you sit down and think about it that are impacted by the price of corn
8628929 however every product that you buy practically is impacted by the price of oil say you buy a twinkie that twinkie will have traveled 1 500 miles before you buy it you think about that at 4 25 per gallon for diesel fuel and thats a pretty significant number
8628930 when someone talks about the food supply or the diversion of crops they are not being 100 percent honest about factoring in the feed co product that comes from the process
8628931 thats one study there are probably 100 others that find the opposite
8628932 the department of agriculture has one for example what they say is when you factor in the entire process including the production of distillers grains thats that feed co product you get 67 percent more energy than it took to produce and the industry is getting more efficient
8628933 to produce ethanol with as much energy as we use in transportation would require 1 1 billion acres devoted to high yield corn production complete with all the things environmentalists hate fertilizer irrigation and pesticides thats about 1 8 million square miles some 51 percent of the land area of the 50 states
8628934 nobodys talking about that no one is saying ethanol is going to be the gallon for gallon replacement for oil
8628935 but its part of the solution and the land use issue they use some really wide generalities when they look at that issue
8628936 then they cried out to the lord in their trouble and he brought them out of their distress he stilled the storm to a whisper the waves of the sea were hushed they were glad when it grew calm and he guided them to their desired haven

8628945 i feel privileged to have worked for the fringe it is the greatest arts festival on the planet and plays an important role in developing and showcasing new performing talent on a world stage
8628946 however the role of fringe director has taken me away from my first love of producing and presenting exciting performances to audiences and my intention is to return to that more direct relationship with artists and audiences
8628947 i have been considering this for some time but felt it was important not to announce my departure before the festival so as not to impact on this years festival
8628948 following discussion with the board i have now decided to step down with immediate effect
8628949 i never thought id live this long to see this
8628950 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8628951 lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate

8628954 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8628955 and companies that started offshoring support functions it and bpo are now increasingly looking at offshoring core functions including product development and engineering activities

8628958 what we try to do is apply science to the art of searching cap members are at the forefront of searching for missing aircraft taking the time to add a few tools to the search toolbox can hopefully help the members find the missing aircraft quicker and hopefully save lives which is what this is all about
8628959 applying search theory correctly hopefully will allow us to employ our limited cap resources in a much smarter and more efficient manner
8628960 there is nothing greater a person can do then to give up their time and life for others cap is a great organization that continually meets the intent of the rescue motto these things we do that others may live

8628981 one of the recommendations in the commissions report is that there should be universal health care systems that are available to people regardless of ability to pay
8628982 virtually all advanced countries have universal health care systems but we dont think that should be limited to high income countries we think that could be much more broadly available
8628983 we are distressed by the reports we see of health care simply being unavailable to people because of inability to pay we see that throughout low and middle income countries
8628984 its not perhaps the best use of the money that is being spent and there are a lot people who feel that and would actually like to see coming out of the current campaign in the u s proposals for a universal health insurance
8628985 the importance of prevention continues to grow partly because of escalating health care costs we simply cannot afford the way we go about doing health care nowadays without tackling and doing more prevention

8629031 so we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8629032 on the one hand obama is expected to give one of the best speeches in american history so expectations are enormously high there will be 75 000 people an unprecedented number in attendance cheering him on but because of the attacks on obama as just another celebrity if it looks too much like a rock concert obama could actually be penalized for doing well he could also be penalized if the speech does not meet the skyrocketing expectations for another gettysburg address
8629033 well he probably cannot do what he really would like to do which is make people comfortable about him about his foreign policy experience about the direction of change that he wants to bring and i think that will take time
8629034 what he realistically can do is impress people remind them those who do not know him how articulate he is how sharp is what a great motivator he is and generally get good reviews

8629064 as the self proclaimed largest pro hunting organization in the world the national rifle association has long claimed to represent americas hunters and shooters in the fight to protect one of americas oldest traditions
8629065 the nras bylaws include an article setting a core goal to promote and defend hunting as a viable and necessary method of fostering the propagation growth and conservation of our renewable wildlife resources but it turns out that its by laws are just empty rhetoric
8629066 our goal is to pull back the curtain on the ugly truth

8629078 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
8629079 what is needed from the devolved administration at stormont is a set of policies to take account of the different population profiles in the catholic and protestant communities to answer their different needs and stop following the outdated nio mindset of trying to pretend that everything here would be ok if everyone started behaving as if they lived in england
8629080 in january five north belfast protestant clergy wrote to the unionist oriented news letter complaining of the failure of the executive to tackle sectarianism they wrote we have poor inter community relationships effective apartheid in housing across our villages towns and cities community division exemplified in but not confined to the physical structures of peace walls slow pace of reconciliation sectarianism and fractured educational provision our real angst is that a suggested programme for government almost totally fails to acknowledge these profoundly difficult issues exist the response from the dup junior minister in ofmdfm mr donaldson was that power sharing was the shared interpretation which seemed to confuse politics as means with the ends it aimed to realise the draft programme for government had significantly replaced the language of a shared future with a better future inline with its prioritisation of the economy a much more convivial focus for members of the political class than the challenge of tackling the communal divisions in which they were so deeply implicated the revised pfg32 published by messrs paisley and mcguinness introduced the clumsy circumlocution of a shared and better future
8629081 is a matter the government has to consider in due course but we are not at that point in our discussions at all yet the point of discussion we are at at the moment is examining the outcome of the referendum and obviously there will be a lot meetings with eu colleagues between now and the end of the year where it will be discussed further with them so its not just a matter for our own personal consideration or national consideration it is a matter we have to discuss with colleagues as well
8629082 in every society there is a substantial gap between the life expectancy of the children of the most affluent and privileged and those who are born into deprivation but some countries are better than others at closing the gap
8629083 a boy in the suburb of calton glasgow can expect to live 28 years less than one raised in lenzie a few miles away one born in hampstead london will live around 11 years longer than a boy from st pancras five stops away on the northern line of the underground
8629084 even in these times when all the talk is of putting history behind us the easiest way to tell the difference between the irish and the english is to utter the word
8629085 i was myself assaulted and received death threats the depth of hatred that still exists in ireland is matched only by unawareness in non catholic english circles of what cromwell did in ireland i am reminded of gk chestertons remark that the tragedy of the english conquest of ireland in the 17th century is that the irish can never forget it and the english can never remember it
8629086 it was in accordance with the laws of war but it went far beyond what any general had done in england
8629087 this was ethnic cleansing on a scale undreamt of by slobodan milosevic
8629088 reverence for cromwell was one of the few socialist traditions that survived the transition from old to new labour

8629091 it is increasingly a manifestation of republican frustration at the failure of sinn f in to deliver what it promised to its own movement
8629092 nationalists and republicans will once again be disappointed by the attitude being displayed by the sdlp
8629093 any commitments that were given by the government to sinn f in are a matter for the government but the dup made the situation perfectly clear before we left st andrews that we had not agreed to any dates for the transfer of powers
8629094 i say again that until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved it should not be taking on more especially a portfolio as contentious as justice
8629095 i was outside the family home when the raid began and i was inside immediately afterwards speaking with the family who are close friends of mine the reality of the ruc psni was here for all to see in broad daylight and the residents of this estate remain justifiably suspicious of the force
8629096 most accounts agree that it was south ossetian separatists who committed the first act of escalation when they blew up a georgian military vehicle on august 1 wounding five georgian peacekeeping troops georgia responded in kind killing six south ossetian militiamen
8629097 capt ivanov and eduard kokoity the pro moscow president of south ossetia say they held a meeting that day between marat kulakhmetov commander of the russian peacekeeping forces and temur yakobashvili the georgian minister for re integration whose job is to deal with the breakaway regions
8629098 i would like to address those who are now shooting at georgian policemen i want to say with full responsibility that several hours ago i reached a very difficult decision not to respond with fire this was no use however and the fighting escalated
8629099 georgian president sakashvilis biggest lie was his attempt to airbrush the fact that he created the crisis by launching an artillery barrage on the south ossetian capital which killed scores of civilians and 15 russian peacekeepers it was absurd to think russia would not retaliate so the next lie was to claim russias leaders had prepared a trap in fact they were taken by surprise as much as the ossetians nevertheless russia should pull back completely now it should also have restrained south ossetian militias from running amok against georgian villages

8629105 yet there were indications that no 10 had more room for manoeuvre than it realised in july 2005 the ira had finally agreed to decommission all its weapons at the last minute adams called no 10 to demand that some of the weapons not be destroyed so that the ira could arm itself against possible attacks from dissident members unless this was allowed he threatened decommissioning would not proceed the blair government conceded but wanted to check with dublin irish justice minister michael mcdowell refused to acquiesce in the backsliding despite enormous pressure powell told adams of the problem and adams gave way decommissioning took place as planned

8629108 trends differ for the four countries of the uk the population of england is projected to increase by 8 per cent by 2016 that of northern ireland by 7 per cent big year that and wales by 5 per cent the projected increase for scotland where fertility and life expectancy levels are assumed to remain lower than in the rest of the uk is 3 per cent across the united kingdom northern ireland recorded the highest rate of growth with a one per cent population rise last year to 1 8 million people the population of england rose by 0 6 per cent to 51 1 million scotland and wales rose by 0 5 per cent

8629114 discussions on the devolution of policing and justice have progressed well in the preparation for government committee the governments have requested the parties to continue these discussions so as to agree the necessary administrative arrangements to create a new policing and justice department it is our view i e the view of the two governments that the implementation of the agreement published today should be sufficient to build the community confidence necessary for the assembly to request the devolution of criminal justice and policing from the british government by may 2008
8629115 there is no definitive date for the devolution of policing and justice powers we remain of the unshakable view that those powers can only be transferred whenever there is the required community confidence

8629206 non angustiarti non preoccuparti se tutti ti abbandonano andiamo a fare una passeggiata e dimentichiamocene
8629207 certo certo e ci che vuoi che io pensi e quando mi sveglie sar molto peggio se mi sveglier il che non avverr perch sono gi morta
8629208 capisco che tu possa avermi scambiato per un incubo ma non riesco a immaginare cosa potresti aver fatto di tanto brutto per finire allinferno ne hai ammazzati molti in mia assenza
8629209 la gente pensa che la vita sia una strada dritta ma sbaglia la vita un circolo un maledetto cerchio che gira in tondo alla fine ti ritrovi in mano esattamente quello che avevi allinizio e finisci per tornare al luogo da cui sei venuto
8629210 mi rimasto cos poco a cui aggrapparmi e non voglio che mi venga tolto
8629211 ti sbagli la realt ce li strappa a uno a uno
8629212 miley cyrus is just a little too tarty forgive me i dont want her to look like shes going into a convent school but its just a little too much for a 15 year old if i didnt know better id swear she was 25
8629213 i have to say katie holmes has become so much more sophisticated in so many ways but i think shes in a dip right now i cant explain it
8629214 this was a prescheduled meeting aimed at discussing security matters at a strategic level the discussion was held in an open and cordial manner
8629215 there is a delightful parallel between these impressively simple experiments and the experiments of who investigated the laws of motion of the universe with metal balls on an inclined plane
8629216 i havent seen anything that comes close to the horrendous facts that were presented in this case
8629217 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8629218 the vehicle was going to pick up prisoners and as it reached a bridge an explosive laden car exploded and nine of our policemen and two passers by were killed
8629219 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8629220 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8629221 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8629222 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8629223 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8629224 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8629225 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8629226 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8629227 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8629228 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8629229 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8629230 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8629231 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8629232 home sick has been a film that seems like it has been years in the making
8629233 home sick may have had a long hard road to its dvd release but the journey is absolutely worth the wait
8629234 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8629235 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8629236 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8629237 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8629238 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8629239 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8629240 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8629241 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8629242 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8629243 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8629244 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8629245 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8629246 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8629247 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8629248 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8629249 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8629250 you cant put a price on this kind of support
8629251 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8629252 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8629253 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8629254 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8629255 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8629256 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8629257 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8629258 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8629259 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8629260 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8629261 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8629262 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8629263 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8629264 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8629265 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8629266 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8629267 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8629268 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8629269 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8629270 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8629271 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8629272 no one works for someone we all just work together
8629273 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8629274 we are more than happy that the guardian has shown this interest in the way that ordnance survey communicates about the important work that we do
8629275 it is because ordnance survey data is so vital that parliamentarians and other important stakeholders expect us to communicate with them about our work
8629276 were committed to the best possible communications with all our stakeholders now and in the future
8629277 on comments from the meeting that you should be aware of
8629278 as they are currently looking for proposals for their manifesto
8629279 it has some of its origins in the telecoms collapse and the fact that both the academic and the industrial guys were left with predictions being a little scattered to the four winds
8629280 it certainly relies on a lot of trust between the companies and the university
8629281 there is also the more general commercialisation activities that are going on
8629282 in the judge business school they have people interested in studying the commercialisation process in detail epsrc sees the cikc as an experiment to improve the commercial relevance of the research that it funds
8629283 under the cikc we are trying to turn these into something that can be manufactured
8629284 we have worked on n type p type cmos like transistors and new architectures for devices under the cikc we are trying to bridge the gap between basic science and what industry would consider exploitable
8629285 there is a special interest in low temperature deposition of conductors and semiconductors onto plastic
8629286 one of the bright hopes in that area is zinc oxide
8629287 its very encouraging to see that plastic electronics is finding its way into the marketplace
8629288 plastic logic is quite close to launching its first products weve not announced publicly when there will be a product and what that produce will be but the dresden facility was completed on time a few weeks ago at the moment the equipment is being moved in and the first production runs will start in a couple of months then the company will announce what were actually going to make
8629289 it was never contemplated that we would build a manufacturing facility in cambridge
8629290 if you want to manufacture you need skills in manufacturing not skills in research and development there was no existing manufacturing industry in the cambridge region whereas in dresden you have the big fabs amd infineon etc who have a lot of manufacturing expertise and a lot of skilled people
8629291 in dresden there is quite a good microelectronics cluster and it is understood that people change positions everybody benefits from a pool of skilled technical staff thats something you just wouldnt have in cambridge
8629292 the business model we are adopting seeks to minimise disruption to the existing chain of companies in the printing industry there is an element of risk to this as it is potentially more difficult to secure a position compared with for example vertical integration
8629293 we look at printing processes mainly conventional screen offset flexo and how the use of conductive inks and the addition of conventional electronics can be used in combination to add value to products
8629294 the challenge of organic electronics and particularly at a company like plastic logic is that it is based on a new product novalias model is to focus on what we are best at which is developing a capability that can be enabled through the use of conductive inks with conventional printing
8629295 i have discovered just how many processes there are in the printing industry how many parallels there are to those used in electronics and how resourceful printers can be
8629296 printing is all about communication but the dialogue is all one way in many ways printed electronics can enable this dialogue to be two way and we believe there is the potential for a revolution in communication through printed media
8629297 we share the optimism about whats going to happen and whats starting to happen in plastic displays
8629298 a lot of us here have spent our working lives in displays when the massive manufacturing investment was only being made in the far east to see a chink appearing in that situation is very exciting
8629299 in some sectors of the display market there may be a serious window of opportunity for displays that dont need active matrices at all there are some possibilities for passive multiplexing of large display structures and we are active across all these areas we have two large groups concerned with the materials and optics of liquid crystal devices and the way that technology is going to be modified as a result of plastic displays
8629300 a lot of the activity is now looking forward to the way we wish to go in the second period of cape starting in 2009
8629301 all the evidence from dozens of high level eu usa meetings on justice and home affairs since 11 september 2001 shows that it is a one way street with the eu trying to fend off usa demands when the eu does not cave in the usa simply negotiates bilateral deals with individual member states a permanent eu usa pact would be disastrous for privacy and civil liberties
8629302 the exchange of any of this information defined as important for security purposes was required
8629303 this concept heralds a new era by standardising european police surveillance techniques and creating

8629358 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8629359 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8629360 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8629361 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8629362 terserah aku aku di sini karna aku lebih suka berada ditempat ini daripada berkumpul dengan mahasiswa lainnya untuk membicarakan demondtran aku tidak suka keributan
8629363 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8629364 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8629365 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8629366 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8629367 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8629368 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8629369 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8629370 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8629371 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8629372 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8629373 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8629374 who are open to doing something on the production side
8629375 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8629376 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8629377 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8629378 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8629379 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8629380 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8629381 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8629382 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

8629391 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8629392 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8629393 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8629394 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8629395 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8629396 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8629397 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8629398 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8629399 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8629400 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department

8629412 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8629413 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8629414 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8629415 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8629416 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8629417 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8629418 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8629419 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8629420 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8629421 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8629422 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8629423 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8629424 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8629425 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8629426 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8629427 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8629428 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8629429 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8629430 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8629431 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8629432 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8629433 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8629434 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8629435 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8629436 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8629437 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8629438 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8629439 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8629440 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8629441 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8629442 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8629443 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8629444 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8629445 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8629446 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8629447 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8629448 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8629449 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8629450 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8629451 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8629452 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8629453 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8629454 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8629455 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8629456 not only my indian patients but those from outside india also send me photographs that way i monitor their condition regularly and this they have been doing for the last 2 3 years
8629457 i thought instead of asking them to mail pictures why not consult them also online more than an email if the patient can chat regularly with the specialist it will help him more
8629458 i thought instead of just giving information we can make it a one to one interaction with the specialist once a patient sends in his query the co ordinator passes the question to the concerned specialist and he gives the reply for example if a patient asks why do i have heel pain early in the morning it is the orthopaedic surgeon who can answer the question if the specialist feels the necessity to interact with the patient there will be a one to one chat with him at an appointed time
8629459 i have irritation in both my feet for three months i have pain also what should i do i am willing to come to the hospital and meet you
8629460 when i discussed with the specialists they have no problem giving free advice now later when it becomes a paid service we have to think of the payment modalities
8629461 the union government must authorise the army to move its troops into affected blocks of kandhamal district where the local police and rapid action force have miserably failed
8629462 we broke a pair of the plastic tongs and cant find any more so we need to order some
8629463 more recent statistics have already indicted a more or less abrupt change in the number of people afflicted
8629464 in the past two years anti retroviral drugs have become available for free meaning some hiv positive people previously unknown to the authorities are now being reported
8629465 in the philippines the low partner exchange the frequency or the number of male clients of prostitutes frequenting other partners the contributory factor of circumcision those are some of the conditions that have somehow kept the hiv prevalence low
8629466 but what were saying is it does mask the threat because it might not reveal the changes in the way hiv is spreading
8629467 we await this great entry into the literary world a book with spine from a politician without one
8629468 next week i am going back to school and you are going back to school we are going back to school at the same time
8629469 be kind for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle

8629473 we expect this processing technique to be a standard component of all cellulosic ethanol production in the future because of the increased yield and processing efficiencies we believe it will produce

8629480 children under the age of 5 in the united states are more likely to be killed by their parents than anyone else contrary to popular mythology they are rarely killed by a sex crazed stranger fbi crime statistics show that in 1999 parents were responsible for 57 percent of these murders with family friends and acquaintances accounting for another 30 percent and other family members accounting for 8 percent crime statistics further reveal that of the children under 5 killed from 1976 to 1999 30 percent were murdered by their mothers while 31 percent were killed by their fathers and while the strangers acquaintances and other family members who kill children skew heavily toward males as does the entire class of murderers children are as likely to be murdered by their fathers as by their mothers

8629581 his sculpture of moss said to be the largest gold statue to be made in the world since the time of ancient egypt
8629582 in our lab were seeing a complete disappearance of the cypher and taxus
8629583 with the taxus i think its because the results from spirit iii favored xience over taxus and with the cypher its a good stent but its first generation and less deliverable
8629584 everybody is trying the newer stents out and taking them out for a spin
8629585 they are the new darling and most interventionalists myself among them tend to be somewhat enamored of and curious about the new thing but the challenge for us with these types of devices is that the only thing you can really honestly evaluate is how they feel in your own hands how they deliver and how they look no single person or single center has enough real experience with any of these new stents to make good strong conclusions about long term performance and the things we really care about like mortality or even restenosis
8629586 people will say that in the cases when youre really worried about restenosis you would stick to the xience promus cypher or taxus but if youre worried more about stent thrombosis or patient compliance with dual antiplatelet therapy you would favor endeavor thats the tendency
8629587 the perception is that the endeavor still is the safer stent long term even though there are no definitive data
8629588 certainly when there is any issue about the antiplatelet use i will go with an endeavor stent those data seem very promising although its still not yet proven that its much safer it just seems to be looking that way
8629589 in the cypher taxus category as really a potent antirestenotic device
8629590 i use a little differently i do believe that the late safety story emerging with endeavor is pretty compelling and when the studies are done i do not think well need the long term dual antiplatelet therapy with this device
8629591 when you look at the available data i dont think they have a compelling story to make them sound like they are necessarily better than any of the other des
8629592 and thats the only reason to use that stent as far as im concerned
8629593 even with endeavor we dont have any data with less than six months of dual antiplatelet therapy and what were worried about is the people who are going to stop taking it in the first month or two so i havent tended to use endeavor with that idea in mind
8629594 if i am really worried about compliance with dual antiplatelet therapy ill use a bare metal stent
8629595 i dont think we can be sure and cross trial comparisons are fraught with hazard but there are at least some data to suggest endeavor might possibly have a lower late thrombosis rate than other des
8629596 it is also slightly easier to deliver than other des but to be honest they all deliver well enough to make ease of delivery a nonissue in the overwhelming majority of cases
8629597 at least in some peoples minds since the drugs are similar theyre substituting the xience promus for cypher directly
8629598 others are more concerned about the lack of a robust long term data set for safety and have not made that switch and i tend to be in that camp
8629599 the stents that weve been using for the past five years were really frozen in time
8629600 the bare metal technology moved way ahead in terms of deliverability so its nice to have the combination of both back
8629601 weve heard of both endeavor stents and xience promus stents occasionally coming off the balloon to a greater extent than one would expect based on our experience with the other stents weve also in our own lab had some issues with the xience sticking to the balloon very reminiscent of the taxus experience
8629602 it may be a matter of overconfidence or just that these stents are very deliverable and it may be a matter of trying to deliver them in situations in which you wouldnt even contemplate putting a cypher for example so its hard to know how much to blame the stent the operator or the expectations
8629603 if it were occurring i would probably chalk it up more to trying these stents in tougher lesions than we otherwise would than to any kind of manufacturing defects just like when cypher first came out people very zealously reported stent thromboses and those kinds of things
8629604 i dont think its a problem we havent seen anything like this in our lab i heard of one or two cases of dislodgement with endeavor elsewhere and i also heard of one or two cases where people couldnt retrieve the balloon with the xience but i wouldnt put much stock in these reports because i think people are oversensitive to anything when its new if something significant had come up we would have heard about it more vocally
8629605 not aware of anyone really pushing these devices beyond where we were at the high water mark with the previous versions
8629606 if you size these in a certain manner and then overdilate a very compliant balloon theres a chance for edge dissection
8629607 thats nothing intrinsic to the device its how theyre being used
8629608 the dislodgement rate with endeavor is very low less than one hundredth of 1
8629609 all stents are affected by dislodgement at low rates it is well understood by physicians and arises from the unavoidable need to force stents into difficult anatomies
8629610 the maude database is a valuable resource but as the fda has publicly commented on several occasions it should not be used to make device comparisons this is particularly the case when looking at a newly available product and examples of a technology that are nearing the end of their lifecycle for example maude takes no account of the possibility that one device is being used preferentially over another in challenging patients because of design and performance advantages such preferential usage could result in a disparity of adverse events associated with a particular device in maude precisely because of its superior performance

8629620 the sorting crew usually consists of two to seven ladies depending on their schedules and they work a few hours a week during the initial sort
8629621 our members are very obliging with their time when it comes to volunteering
8629622 its a fun time and allows for conversation and an unhurried chance to get reading materials at a reasonable cost while benefiting the society
8629623 as you can see we members actually have two homes the one we live in and the iams homestead property they each vie for our time and the iams homestead vies for donations of members income from events and gracious gifts of time and money from local business we all work together to make it happen
8629624 if i were to name names of everyone who has helped i know i would miss very important hardworking people so suffice to say everyone who volunteers is a special person

8629637 overall this was a fairly strong report and suggests that the fiscal stimulus driven consumption spending and weak dollar added significant momentum to u s economic activity in q2
8629638 however with the dollar strengthening in the past few months and the tax rebate cheques spent economic activity is expected to moderate significantly in the coming quarters
8629639 the domestic picture continues to look a bit soggy but the lift to growth from net exports is very welcome

8629645 i make my vows to god for one year temporary vows of obedience poverty and chastity according to the rules and life of the brothers and sisters of the third regular order of st francis of assisi and the constitution of this congregation

8629665 we are very convinced that our performance will improve dramatically and this is based on the discussions we had with people and the commitment they openly and privately made to prof mills
8629666 if we relate the attitude responses level of enthusiasm and open declaration of support and compare that to the 2000 and 2004 election prof mills is convinced about winning the region
8629667 it is wrong for any chief to declare publicly the political parties they are supporting in whatever you do you must make sure that even your most beloved wife does not know the party you support
8629668 we should find ways to unite in our quest to develop the region
8629669 the way forward is for both government and traditional leadership to take responsibility to make violent conflict unattractive
8629670 our chiefs in particular must make their leadership relevant to the aspirations of majority of our people rather than serving the interest of few ambitions persons

8629679 the executives who will speak at this years conference are not only leaders within their own organizations but theyre also shaping business and leading change in the business technology market
8629680 the informationweek team prides itself on having unrivaled access to the top business technology executives in the industry today
8629681 the informationweek 500 selection process is a rigorous one and were thrilled to have the opportunity to recognize excellence in this forum while also offering invaluable content and networking opportunities for our attendees
8629682 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subject to over a long period of time by the present commissioner sir ian blair

8629685 pone en duda la profesionalidad y la labor impecable del equipo m dico encargado de la identificaci n de las v ctimas
8629686 el gobierno lamenta que un asunto tan doloroso haya sido objeto de un tratamiento informativo tan poco riguroso y con muy poco respeto a la memoria e intimidad de los afectados
8629687 creo que es muy lamentable que se est utilizando ese tema en momento de campa a electoral es un tema muy doloroso para las familias de las v ctimas y para todo el ministerio de defensa para tratarse en este periodo electoral
8629688 algunas familias nunca van a encontrar satisfactoria la explicaci n
8629689 las elecciones pueden justificar muchas cosas pero hay una cosa que me parece injustificable y es que a los muertos no se les deje en paz dejen a los muertos en paz por favor

8629691 mal deben ir algunos cuando tienen que caer en estas cosas

8629693 the spectrum auction process would be end by october and i want the operators to roll out their 3g services within this year
8629694 we wish pakistan and india to solve their disputes in a peaceful way kazakhstan is neutral but we are keen on peace on kashmir dispute we kazakhs dont want to be seen as supporting pakistan or india we want both to continue their dialogue trade could be an instrument for easing disputes between the two cica has not been created for playing a global role
8629695 india plays a significant role in south asia we accept that india is feeling that it does not have the required resources of energy perhaps this could be an area of cooperation with kazakhstan we could also cooperate with indias policy in afghanistan indias balanced approach to the situation in iran is praiseworthy
8629696 from a trade point of view it is a very key issue to be addressed as the indian market is a very big one
8629697 yes we can discuss this countrys involvement in the project
8629698 we will tell the people that we are diversifying the economy maybe russia and china could get jealous about such an initiative an oil relationship with iran kazakhstan sees this as most beneficial we need to take the u s on board we have to take the opinions of big countries for trading with iran if the situation in afghanistan does not improve we can trade with south asia through iran and therefore a diplomatic solution is required for the iran nuclear issue
8629699 we should stop financing the economy of the war in the last 25 years this sort of financing has taken place in afghanistan two generations of afghanistan have been deprived of a civil education instead they have received a military education in afghanistan today one kilogram of heroin is worth more than one kilogram of grain people are realizing that the war in afghanistan cannot be solved militarily
8629700 the basis of our government being the opinion of the people the very first object should be to keep that right and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter
8629701 at its simplest and most benign fear is an internal warning cry that danger is nearby and we had better do something about it it is designed to be what researchers call self correcting mechanism to be unpleasant enough to motivate us to take action and remove ourselves from whatever is threatening us it readies our body to flee hide or fight there is a large physiological component to fear when a fear response is triggered our bodies go into action quick energy hormones like adrenaline get pumped into muscles and the bloodstream blood drains from the skins surface which is what produces the paleness of fear and gets diverted into large muscles like the legs for a quick gateway your heart pounds to enable your body to go into overdrive the eyes widen and pupils expand to take in the maximum amount of information many of the bodys other systems for reproduction digestion and so on shut down to mobilise us for action
8629702 if you want to walk on water youve got to get out of the boat
8629703 between three and six oclock in the morning jesus came to the disciples walking on the water
8629704 i prayed to the lord and he answered me he freed me from all my fears the oppressed look to him and are glad they will never be disappointed the helpless call to him and he answers he saves them from all their troubles
8629705 lord please free me from name the excessive need or fear
8629706 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by maki
8629707 i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing but it was just the best way to go
8629708 i was just so proud to show off my big old jim mcconaughey and his gift
8629709 mark what with your obsession with finding the perfect cherry cheese blintz how were you even able to find the time and focus to write a book like this

8629711 all the people involved in the work of a church who are not clergy
8629712 in imbuing society where they live and work with a christian spirit thus transforming their daily activity into prayer placing christ at the centre of all they do everyday
8629713 to take his place in the home that is the church be all things to all and support new initiatives in which he could sense the inspiration of the holy spirit
8629714 the lay faithful of christ has also received from jesus christ the mission to go into the vineyard which is the church and the world where he has to be witness that he believes in jesus christ as the saviour of all the lay faithful should be the light of the world and the salt of the earth
8629715 the best bible study is a group or community experience
8629716 the experience of life itself is a sufficient starting point for reading the bible
8629717 find meaning without having access to the sophisticated tools of biblical research
8629718 if we throw in all the christians since jesus day the percentage of literate christians is very small
8629719 non literate christians were not deprived of the word it came to them through their ears rather than through their eyes
8629720 even today the churchs preferred way of experiencing the word is in community and more specifically in the liturgy
8629721 the word in catholic tradition is thought of as itself a liturgy and it is meant to prepare the action of the celebration such as the eucharist
8629722 does not need a commentary to find meaning in this parable
8629723 in the zaccheus story i observe that whereas zaccheus wanted to see jesus the surprise is that jesus sees him

8629745 i dont understand myself at all for i really want to do what is right but i dont do it instead i do the very thing i hate when i want to do good i dont and when i try not to do wrong i do it anyway it seems to be a fact of life that when i want to do what is right i inevitably do what is wrong i love gods law with all my heart but there is another law at work within me that is at war with my mind this law wins the fight and makes me a slave to the sin that is still within me
8629746 which goes all the way back to 93s recipe for hate

8629750 jeg sagde ja til projektet da jeg s det som en stor mulighed for at komme til at arbejde med et helt unikt materiale det var en chance som jeg m ske aldrig f r igen jeg har haft fuld kreativ kontrol over videodagbogen og har haft et fantastisk samarbejde med b de nicolas og mads det har v ret en h rd omgang og man skal v re gjort af et s rligt stof for at arbejde p et set som dette men det har v ret en stor oplevelse
8629751 det har v ret helt vildt men n r man filmer med jang er der nu aldrig noget der er almindeligt denne gang har det bare v ret endnu vildere og endnu mere sindssygt one eye er en ekstremt kr vende rolle og optagelserne i skotland er noget af det h rdeste jeg har nogensinde har oplevet men da vi ankom til den sidste location br d solen frem og der var bare s smukt s overordnet set har det v ret dejligt at filme i skotland det har ogs v ret fedt at arbejde sammen med de skotske spillere som jeg kendte lidt til i forvejen men det har is r v ret sjovt at opleve dem p deres egen hjemmebane
8629752 nicolas winding refn er et unikt og enest ende talent og vi gl der os utrolig meget til at udsende valhalla rising p det engelske marked n ste sommer
8629753 wild side films er meget stolt af at medvirke til finansieringen af nicolas winding refns nye film vi mener helt bestemt at denne historie bidrager til nicolas store talent og at mads mikkelsens skuespiltalent vil s rge for at denne film bliver en gl delig overraskelse for det franske publikum de har ventet p denne siden pusher trilogien
8629754 jeg tror fuldt og fast p at nicolas karakteristiske benh rde stil og realistiske indgangsvinkel til historien vil bringe nyt liv til vikingegenren desuden er jeg overbevist om at vi med mads mikkelsen i hovedrollen ser begyndelsen til en ny type actionhelt der p n gang er b de multi facetteret iskold og ikonisk

8629759 upon which side shall the democratic party fight upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital or upon the side of the struggling masses
8629760 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome
8629761 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
8629762 why our opponents are getting jittery and they are trying to throw mud and all sorts of things at us but we would not be distracted
8629763 because there is no sea in the ashanti region president kufuor does not see the need to pay attention to the plight of fishermen
8629764 i do not see how this amounts to playing the ethnic card because it is not only fantes who live at the coast and are engaging in the fishing industry there are gas who live by the coast and are engaging in the fishing industry there are ewes who live near the sea and are engaging in the fishing industry and so how does his reference to the fishing industry amounts to playing the ethnic cards it is just an attempt by the npp to create an impression that doesnt exist prof mills has been campaigning and he never plays the ethnic cards
8629765 struggling very hard to find issues and to tie it to ethnicity and the playing of ethnic cards
8629766 it started as a lark but ive really gotten into it
8629767 like a lot of kids i rode a bike but when i went to san diego i saw it as a sport and started riding seriously when i moved back here i kept it up
8629768 after riding at metroparks i started talking to judge bill littlejohn who was also interested in cycling and we got talking about forming a club we told other people and word of mouth grew among african americans in the community who were cycling but couldnt find each other
8629769 this year we officially formed our club named for marshall w major taylor a big name in the black cycling community who was a champ in the late 1890s
8629770 someone will schedule a ride at least once a week and we have monthly rides
8629771 we post the rides and people show up im really proud of the people who have increased their level of cycling and we want to get more young people involved
8629772 there will be a youth ride of five miles for families and a moderately challenging ride of 22 7 miles for more experienced riders
8629773 the hardest part is getting on the bike most people still remember how to ride and new technology in bikes makes it so much more comfortable for all ages
8629774 truly i tell all of you with certainty unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies it remains alone but if it dies it produces a lot of grain
8629775 rather than tear down the old church or turn it into antique shop or buy land along the interstate and build we decide to add on
8629776 wir dachten wir geben den menschen f r ein paar wochen eine lustige aufgabe damit sie die schlechte wirtschaftslage vergessen

8629778 i immediately know when the design is solid and i can easily justify design decisions when they are questioned
8629779 we have been compelled to resort to this sort of action
8629780 our demand is simple we want to see the judges reinstated so that the rule of law returns to the country
8629781 they say democracy is back in this country but can democracy work without an independent judiciary
8629782 ces n gociations ne sont pas des plus faciles pour nous mais nous sommes d cid s les mener bien

8629796 f r die angeh rigen ist es sehr wichtig dass der t ter nicht mehr frei heruml uft
8629797 die eltern und die geschwister von michelle stehen noch immer unter schock

8629799 wir wollen mit dem braunen sumpf nichts zu tun haben
8629800 es ist aber noch nichts dabei was auf eine bestimmte person hindeutet
8629801 er muss jetzt mal explodieren auch miro wird an seinen leistungen gemessen
8629802 ich glaube an miro klose wenn er fit ist hat er eine unglaubliche ausgeglichenheit
8629803 so fr h m chte ich mich nicht festlegen das h ngt schon davon ab in welcher form er anreist und wie er trainiert
8629804 das macht man eigentlich nur bei spielern die k rperlich richtig angeschlagen sind aber miro ist ja k rperlich belastbar
8629805 das mag sein aber er hat gesagt dass er k rperlich wieder auf ein hohes niveau muss dann wird er mit sicherheit wieder der alte klose
8629806 wenn er wieder die weiten wege gehen kann wird er treffen und als vorbereiter gl nzen das muss er bald schaffen und nicht erst in weiter ferne
8629807 wir alle glauben an ihn wir sch tzen unseren spieler miro wei dass er sich auf uns verlassen kann
8629808 dass miro nat rlich besser spielen muss da sind wir uns alle einig
8629809 gek mpft und gearbeitet das w rde ich miro auch empfehlen
8629810 nach jedem anschlag muss genau untersucht werden ob die sicherheitslage noch verbessert werden kann
