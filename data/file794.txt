7940000 we take this issue extremely seriously and are working to resolve this regrettable loss with graphic data as a matter of urgency
7940001 its been a tough start and the only consolation is that weve played the two teams who im sure are going to slug it out for the title
7940002 i think weve seen in the last few seasons we can beat anybody so you have to be positive you have to believe that you can do it again at least make it to the final
7940003 ive played a few finals now and you can see that anything can happen you can play well you can play not well you can win and lose certainly you have to make it there i think we have the quality and experience to do it and we are looking forward to it
7940004 its been a disappointing start but now we have to pick ourselves up because the next game is chelsea so we cant feel sorry for ourselves we have to continue to work hard
7940005 everyone knows chelsea is a tough game and weve had many tough games against them especially over the last couple of years
7940006 from what ive seen so far this season it will be the same two at the top of the league again
7940007 arsenal and liverpool have the players to push united and chelsea hard but those two are just too strong at the moment they have too many options
7940008 im sure united will end up with berbatov and that will make a big difference for them it will give them another goal threat and another way of playing
7940009 senderos has gone to milan today he will complete his medical today
7940010 the thinking is that at the moment he is not getting the games here and goes to a top level club to play
7940011 we have djourou kolo toure senderos song gallas silvestre so there is congestion at centre back with losing him we want him to play
7940012 the first lesson is you dont necessarily do everything the fans want you to do
7940013 i am a fan too and i would love to have a squad that is much better than everyone elses
7940014 i keep saying money is available but i am not going to say how much but it is enough to buy an experienced international player
7940015 we didnt play well at fulham on saturday but i think all this stuff about us having to buy a complete lot of new players is rubbish we have won one match and lost one in the league and hopefully we will be in the draw for the champions league
7940016 and to the idiot that said riera will be sat on the bench well thats why your a blue hes left sided which is what rafa wanted so dont think your comments are right somehow
7940017 thirty six hours after the job larry was at my door in vegas he was carrying an attach case i said things must have gone well he said there had been a change in how the robbery went down i asked him what he meant he said i had to kill him
7940018 he told me that it started with wayne going in the store as planned
7940019 i couldnt believe he turned a simple robbery into a murder
7940020 larry went back to chicago right afterward within thirty days he moved to las vegas
7940021 one day larry leo and i were sitting in the upper crust when larry got a phone call
7940022 he went to the phone and when he came back he was violent
7940023 i told larry he couldnt do that it wasnt right for the next hour and a half i talked to him about it trying to convince him not to do anything when we finished i felt in my heart that id succeeded
7940024 about ten days later larry said he had to go to chicago
7940025 i got a call the next day telling me about a big killing in mchenry county
7940026 i told larry that the girl was innocent and supposedly had a couple of kids all he said to that was that the kids were probably better off now
7940027 jesus dont ever unleash that bastard on me whatever you do
7940028 as they were taking me to the courtroom we had to walk by two holding cells

7940037 when the numbers were high i would get stopped in the street maybe once a week
7940038 now that the viewing figures are lower on the tv everywhere i go someone will come up to me and say what a huge fan they are that just tells me that people watch the show in a more modern way and that it has reached its sort of critical mass
7940039 tivo had just sort of taken off this was four or five seasons ago and because we were on friday nights most people most fans dont watch it on first run they tivo it and watch it a zillion times
7940040 in fact i dont think we ever go into space
7940041 its really about big business the machinations and the subterfuge that go on inside of it when you have something that is groundbreaking and could change the nature of life and the future
7940042 we just didnt think to register the bacardi trademark so we lost it
7940043 we had the factory that produced the real bacardi rum but we couldnt keep the name
7940044 when could cuban rum be sold in the united states by what company and under what label

7940052 scheduling is very difficult two of them happened to be in venice at the same time because of the burn after reading premiere so there was a brainstorming session
7940053 we sent out a press release one day saying we were on the verge of closing it down and the next day we had 500 000
7940054 they shine the light on the real emergencies and step up where we really need help
7940055 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7940056 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here

7940085 west ham united have absolutely no intention of selling craig bellamy
7940086 he is under contract and is committed to the club craig remains a very important part of our plans for the future
7940087 the club is being run on sound football and business principles in order to develop a squad which can deliver success this season
7940088 no player would be bought or sold unless that helped to achieve that aim
7940089 we are not interested in selling players who are committed to the club and essential to our first team squad
7940090 if a player refuses to sign a new contract or is not crucial to the managers plans then we will look at offers on a case by case basis it is the only sensible way to build for the future
7940091 we have invested in players this summer identified by the manager who add to the quality of the squad and we will continue to do as and when appropriate
7940092 the numbers started out pretty good just over 1 5 million tuned in for the premiere episode but the audience has dropped off
7940093 the one where you worked so hard to get into a private college studied your heart out in search of a life in the social work field only to come home every night and cry because you realized that you werent really helping people that you really couldnt help people the life where you realized that to be a good counselor you had to care but to continue to be a counselor you had to not care that life
7940094 but i fixed that we moved away i got into another line of work using the other part of my major life was so free and uncomplicated then
7940095 you mean the job where you had the fancy title and were in charge of so many things but had to get up at 4 30 in the morning to drive all the way up there to be there early because of your work load the job where they promised raise after raise but instead laid off those around you giving you their duties yes you could leave that job at the door but at what cost a horribly long commute and the stress of not knowing if your paycheck would really clear all the work you did for a man who literally told you thank you once the entire time you were there
7940096 true but i got a free flat of hydroponic tomatoes every week
7940097 and even with the tomatoes you werent happy were you all of the wonderful tomatoes in the world couldnt erase the stress of that job
7940098 oh lets not forget the job you went to from there
7940099 you went to a major corporation you had all kinds of benefits and perks and promises they groomed you for a role that was perfect project management it was awesome for a person like you a perfectionist you did your job perfectly and it was your downfall your boss couldnt find someone like you to replace you so he was afraid to let you go then just to add insult to injury the market crashed the dots bombed the promises made of nothing more than fairy dust floated away i told you it was ending but you didnt want to believe me
7940100 oh but you forget what happened when i took your advice and left
7940101 you told me to get out you pointed me in the direction of the perfect job the perfect answer to all my corporate problems you pushed me toward that sales position you gave me a taste of freedom and all the pieces fell into place and look what happened
7940102 eh ya win some ya lose some how was i supposed to know that going into the travel industry right before september 11th would end the way it did
7940103 plus that job gave you the confidence to start your own business remember
7940104 i miss the freedom of working from home and being able to leave whenever i wanted or schedule appointments without hassle
7940105 you miss working all the time you miss the stress you miss being tied to your job you miss having it infiltrate your entire being you miss not being able to easily walk away because you built it you miss trying to manage people who have different priorities than you
7940106 you thought it was perfect for you and you gave it your all you did a great job of balancing the work load and a baby
7940107 that wasnt really a nervous breakdown no medication was prescribed and no one with an official title diagnosed me with a nervous breakdown
7940108 details details and dont interrupt im trying to get you to realize that your old life wasnt always as rosy as you try to remember it being yes you met wonderful people yes you experienced wonderful things yes you gained some new skills but it wasnt all that parts of it were dark parts of it were messy parts of it were scary but none of that can be compared to what you do now im trying to get you to realize that you are so fortunate to be home with claire this is the lowest paying most unappreciated most incredible and most important job youll ever have
7940109 i know this i was just trying to schedule a hair appointment
7940110 im not too happy about it because i needed to get paid today
7940111 most indications are that gustav will be an extremely dangerous hurricane in the northwestern caribbean sea in a few days

7940113 i knew it was coming but i was hoping to be out before it came
7940114 routine base operations will continue through the day as normal assuming conditions warrant this while emergency preparations continue
7940115 the government orders the population to take precautions because this storm will bring a lot of rain
7940116 theres no rain and wind the sky is clear cars are traveling everywhere i dont think theres a hurricane
7940117 it would be safe to say that im leaning toward that

7940197 the it equipment that appeared on ebay was neither planned nor instructed by the company to be disposed
7940198 investigations are ongoing to find out how this equipment was removed from one of our secure locations
7940199 was a meaningless gesture by the dnc at this point
7940200 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the in denver or the people of colorado
7940201 i think he is trouncing him i want more of a spread of course i want it all
7940202 we will get much more in the house and the senate and we have to have a democratic president nothing less is at stake than our economy our constitution our budget our reputation in the world ending this war the list goes on
7940203 we cannot be diverted to the silliness that the mccain campaign of course they want to talk about paris hilton
7940204 would they want to talk about why they have the worst record of job creation in america
7940205 have attracted millions of more voters first voters voters and many more voters who havent voted in a long time
7940206 many of them are not even reachable by these pollsters
7940207 these are polls of likely voters likely voters are people who have voted in the last two elections and they are likely to vote again they are not the universe of people who will vote on nov 4
7940208 deliver clarity of message about what the choice is and deliver force on the ground
7940209 i wasnt taking any hits at john mccain i was just speaking truth about his record
7940210 when they talk about john mccain having experience he has the experience of being wrong on the on tax cuts you name it
7940211 but let me tell you this this election is about the economy it always is and its a question of who has the leverage and for eight years the wealthiest 1 percent has had the leverage
7940212 think of me as a lioness you threaten my cubs you have a problem
7940213 the president was very isolated he doesnt want to work in a bipartisan way
7940214 will be one of the first bills we would put on the presidents desk
7940215 thats not a full 100 days agenda its more like 100 hours
7940216 just when you had seen it all the beautiful beautiful presentation by
7940217 vets for freedom will not stand by and let the incredible progress of our troops go unnoticed by the american public and lawmakers from either side of the aisle
7940218 it is essential that our top legislators regardless of party understand the importance of victory in iraq the consequences of defeat and the success of the surge
7940219 sen obama has said that he would still oppose the surge if given another opportunity and has pointed to every outside factor but the surge to explain improvements in iraq we hope he will listen to the veterans who have served there and support this important resolution for the sake of the troops

7940236 the vast majority of players do the right thing but when theres an incident like this it certainly has the ability to tar everyone with a brush that they dont necessarily deserve
7940237 of course these types of incidents are alarming but it is important that they are dealt with appropriately and i believe that the clubs in recent years have acted very responsibility in these types of situations

7940239 by and large clubs have done that over the past few years
7940240 everybody from me to you to the pope has to be given a chance of showing that theyre innocent and thats the position that hes in now

7940265 i thought we were in a good moment but we didnt play well in our last three games that was clear
7940266 if you are asking me if i am considering defeat then the answer is no
7940267 they were good in the first game but we were really poor if we improve and play at our level it will be difficult for them
7940268 if we are winning games and not playing well it means we should find it easier to win games when we do play well

7940273 this latest evidence needs to be considered in light of two separate tests conducted by the transport accident investigation commission which each reached different conclusions and which the commission itself accepted could therefore not be relied upon
7940274 the inconsistency of the results reflects the difficulty experienced by both authorities in assessing the seaworthiness of the vessel after the accident this was due to the kotuku being badly damaged after sinking and saturated after spending a week on the sea floor prior to it being transported via road and subjected to further tests while drying out in the open air

7940311 aan de andere kant is het ook belangrijk dat we blijven opletten we moeten blijven zoeken naar mogelijkheden om de komende jaren andere windparken te bouwen zowel op land als op zee dat is de enige manier om ons doel te bereiken en tegelijkertijd te laten zien aan de internationale gemeenschap dat denemarken serieus aan het proberen is de doelstellingen voor de reductie van broeikasgassen te halen

7940325 the inc 5000 gives an unrivalled portrait of young underreported companies across all industries doing fascinating things with cutting edge business models as well as older companies that are still showing impressive growth
7940326 while we are extremely pleased with the results obtained from the work undertaken to date on our three marketed and seven pipeline drugs four of which are moving towards commercial release we feel this success is not yet represented in shareholder value
7940327 we have invested heavily in the respective successful development of our products now we need assistance in developing our companys share valuation
7940328 collectively these developments have substantially increased the value of sinobiomed which has seen a dramatic corresponding increase in market capitalization of nearly 200 the company believes however that its valuation remains well below the market capitalization and corresponding share price of above 3 00 per share we further believe that our share price has been impacted by the overall decline in the chinese capital markets
7940329 we have therefore retained cb capital partners as our financial advisor to assist in reviewing our strategic alternatives with the objective of maximizing shareholder value and we look forward to working with them to ensure that all alternatives available to the company are considered and evaluated to achieve that objective
7940330 you may have a fresh start any moment you choose for this thing that we call
7940331 we believe the merger will result in a leadership position in the less lethal market and greatly improve the efficiencies of distribution and production of less lethal products marketed to law enforcement private security corrections and the military
7940332 several years ago i was asked by the board to take over the management of pepperball to grow and expand its established non lethal product base and name brand the greatest opportunity we saw for the company was a need in the marketplace for new products and that need became the focus of management and the board with the product development financed by that group today the new product development efforts have resulted in two totally new finished products called the flashlauncher and the sa 4 which we are introducing through our existing distribution channels as well as new channels for the consumer market we are ramping up production and have commenced initial sales of these products additionally pepperball is completing market testing and beginning production of a new lightweight hand held product that is designed for personal protection for use in the consumer and institutional market we believe this new product to have a very broad potential market we believe that our new products including those pictured below will rapidly achieve significant sales and we expect that the merging of our companies will result in an excellent growth opportunity in a market we believe has significant worldwide potential
7940333 we are very pleased and excited with the progress that has been made to date and the relationship that has been developed between swat and pti in advancing to this point and looking to close the merger following the upcoming shareholder meetings the joining of swat and pepperball will create a supplier with a full line of less lethal launchers and projectiles led by a very experienced and dedicated management team and at the same time eliminate the litigation existing between the two organizations that has been expensive and distracting for both companies
7940334 as part of the excitement around the launch of the iphone some of our team have been joining customers outside our shops their aim is to welcome people to the orange shop share in their excitement and give information about orange tariffs
7940335 rio only seemed to come out with their tailings dam info when watchdog got wind of it months ago back in february
7940336 next minute we got double page ads in the paper a few meetings and a few posters on the notice board what we didnt get was prior consultation ie before planning i wonder if anyone in rio ever thought for a minute about the poor pricks living right across the road from the dam did anyone cite potential dramas with night time noise for those residents and their kids let alone the dust

7940346 southern coalfields eastern panhandle northern panhandle where im from and a central location in west virginia

7940348 i think if he comes to west virginia hits the northern panhandle goes to wheeling morgantown thatll be picked up in the media markets in pittsburgh in columbus and those are both two big states in play with pennsylvania and ohio
7940349 its been hard for me as a lot of west virginians because i was a hillary supporter and the state went for hillary three to one
7940350 im hoping he comes to west virginia all the things im hearing about him here at this convention makes me more excited
7940351 since weve been so dry even though were going to get some heavy rain were not expecting any significant water problems at this time

7940362 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the pro social option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7940363 we believe pro social behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more pro social choices they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
7940364 some of these investments include the introduction of new courses and curricula the purchase of thousands of new computers and teaching technologies major upgrades to the school bus fleet and significant additions to school library collections
7940365 these resources along with the 41 new teachers we are adding this year will enhance the teaching and learning environment for years to come
7940366 anything that has to do with security we immediately think about national security 9 11 oh my goodness thats something we have to do

7940368 climate hysteria is the biggest threat to freedom and prosperity in the united states right now
7940369 legislators around the country are passing laws based on global warming and it is getting worse
7940370 they are increasing taxes based on data that may not be true
7940371 the bottom line remains before you embark on something as aggressive as cap and trade you need to make sure the facts are accurate you need to know the goals you intend to achieve actually will do something positive and then youve got to do one other little thing
7940372 youve got to make sure the whole world plays by the same rules right now thats not the case thats absolutely not the case
7940373 pretend for a moment that the global warming advocates are completely right pretend for a moment that the concept of cap and trade is right it should frighten you that the bureaucratic federal government would set down and allocate among the various industries various sections of the country who got to use energy and who did not and that the federal government would decide who would pay for the privilege of using more energy and how the money would be transferred between various parts of the country

7940395 as you know attorney general guidelines were first implemented in the wake of the fbi abuses of the 1960s and 1970s and serve as one of the most important bulwarks against future abuses
7940396 given the importance of these guidelines providing a period of time for public comment would be a reasonable and responsible way to move forward and achieve the best possible end result
7940397 the guidelines will require all activities to have a valid purpose
7940398 we are particularly concerned that the draft guidelines might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities

7940402 we tapped right into that allowing customers to create a space where potential customers could physically meet like at a coffee shop or a restaurant and show each other kindles

7940415 peace initiatives and tibetan cultural preservation projects important to the dalai lama
7940416 apple management needs to choose between developing china as a market or the freedom to engage in random acts of passive aggressive panda punching
7940417 anyone who promotes censorship and tyranny of thought for the sake of making for a big company is pure evil simple as that
7940418 the gc games convention will be back in leipzig again in 2009
7940419 it was to be expected that the leipzig trade fair would try to keep the topic in its 2009 program as well by announcing its date
7940420 but they will have to do it without the industry for the most part the lead trade fair will take place in cologne in 2009 and beyond
7940421 from leipzig we are bringing the clear message that the games industry will be exhibiting in 2009 in cologne at gamescom
7940422 we have met with broad approval and the industry is looking forward to gathering in cologne whatever happens in germany in 2009 outside of cologne cannot claim to represent this sector
7940423 ik heb de eer gehad om al meer nummers te horen van deze hemelse groep zoals devil from hell echt op mijn lijf geschreven familierock is ook zon graaf nummer en als ze de finale halen dan mag nikki mij leren screamen dat kan mij in de hel nog goed van pas komen
7940424 a not cia da a o movida contra a secretaria municipal de educa o causou surpresa

7940426 this is what we think is in our best interest for the long term
7940427 tyrod would benefit from another year of learning and this is our plan for now
7940428 youd probably do it in a couple of catchments to see if the model will work
7940429 in most of canterbury the issue is mainly about allocation but not quality so you may not be able to use the whole of the model there might be places where nutrient concerns as well as quantity could be used
7940430 obviously with the number of takes you have got in canterbury you probably are a reasonable place to start and see if this model could work if the government could help provide metering set up the registry
7940431 indications are that for example a national registry might be 30m to put in place thats a one off cost
7940432 for an era when our supply of water was vastly greater than our needs
7940433 insya allah seandainya diizinkan dan jika tiada aral saya akan melangkah masuk ke parlimen seawal hari esok dengan menggalas harapan rakyat keseluruhannya
7940434 saya ucap terima kasih atas kesudian dan kepercayaan rakyat di permatang pauh yang memberikan undi kepada saya
7940435 di sebalik pelbagai bentuk intimidasi yang dilaksanakan oleh umno bn keberanian rakyat untuk menerobos halangan ini sangat dihargai
7940436 tiada keperluan untuk beliau mengangkat sumpah dengan segera bukannya ada perebutan kuasa
7940437 mengapa perlu tergesa gesa kita tidak boleh membuat andaian bahawa orang yang menang pilihanraya itu akan terburu buru datang dan berbahas dengan speaker dan angkat sumpah
7940438 ada sebulan lebih untuk sesiapa yang menang untuk kita tetapkan bila angkat sumpah supaya ahli parlimen berkenaan boleh mengambil bahagian dalam perbahasan bajet tetapi saya sudah bersiap sedia untuk segala galanya
7940439 en pleno mes de agosto y en ambas m rgenes
7940440 es positivo que el ayuntamiento quiera repoblar las zonas de la ciudad como tablada siempre cuando esto no implique dejarnos sin rboles
7940441 contact doesnt see any significant upside in the 2009 financial year
7940442 so with a lack of growth the shares look fully priced around current levels
7940443 that would be a valuable contribution to the south island in the next month to six weeks as the coldest part of the winter rolls out
7940444 frankly it is time for the establishment of a palestinian state
7940445 this denial of the historical spiritual and archeological connections of the jews to the temple mount is something new
7940446 there was always talk about the temple of solomon in jerusalem called the praise of jerusalem in arabic literature in islamic literature
7940447 in the washington dc think tanks surrounding president bill clinton it was understood that the temple mount was the crux of the problem of the middle east conflict
7940448 its a brilliant idea an excellent idea but totally idiotic from a practical point of view you cannot have a building standing with its foundations in another country you cannot have a building with the infrastructure and the plumbing in another country and you cannot have sovereignty on the subground without having accessibility to the subground because the accessibility is from above ground the whole thing was stupid
7940449 i thought there would be more glass on the floor
7940450 it was pretty cosmetic damage but it was enough to make it unsaleable i hate to see good food go to waste so i called the food bank
7940451 americas pharmaceutical research companies have taken positive steps to help ensure they provide nothing but accurate and balanced information to health care providers
7940452 i want to make sure were not marketing for industry or being influenced by their marketing
7940453 its a good plan and its a big deal that a place like stanford has adopted it
7940454 when this is all over medical education will not be the same as what its been
7940455 reforms based on transparency can foster accountability and build confidence in medical education and in turn the practice of medicine
7940456 lessentiel est invisible aux yeux on ne voit bien quavec le coeur
7940457 most indications are that gustav will be an extremely dangerous hurricane in the northwestern caribbean sea in a few days
7940458 i knew it was coming but i was hoping to be out before it came
7940459 routine base operations will continue through the day as normal assuming conditions warrant this while emergency preparations continue
7940460 the government orders the population to take precautions because this storm will bring a lot of rain
7940461 theres no rain and wind the sky is clear cars are traveling everywhere i dont think theres a hurricane
7940462 licenciado ra l padilla l pez por este conducto y en virtud de los art culos 32 y 35 de la ley org nica de la universidad y con fundamento en la cl usula 8 del reglamento del propio fideicomiso le notifico que le revoco a partir del d a de hoy como presidente del fideicomiso cargo honor fico que ostentaba por lo que deber abstenerse de realizar cualquier acto inherente al puesto
7940463 this will definitely put a dent in drought conditions but it wont end it
7940464 its like concrete youve got less vegetation and more areas exposed to runoff
7940465 we had a weather spotter who reported more than 27 inches
7940466 everyones just drying out and trying to get back to normal
7940467 it could have been worse and we were preparing for that
7940468 we did not take action at the august 13 meeting because we had insufficient information
7940469 what was supposed to be a cordial meeting turned into what i feel was a deliberate partisan attack on the director of elections who has no vote in the decision you made as a board to not have additional sites at your last meeting
7940470 i was embarrassed for myself as well as both of my employees who heard parts of this loud one sided discussion through the closed wooden door of my office
7940471 i am outraged that our director was cornered in her own office to sit through a loud abusive attack by a political office holder for doing the job we directed her to carry out
7940472 i am embarrassed that we have permitted our director to be abused and berated by office holders
7940473 rep wainwright and i were simply trying to be advocates for the people we represent
7940474 we went in all good faith to have a meeting i certainly did not intend to be rude to her in any way i was just being passionate for my constituents
7940475 i must have been in a different meeting none of the accusations in the letter took place when i was in the meeting it is unfortunate that this has been blown out of proportion
7940476 i didnt intend to offend her in any way but she has taken personal offense and notified quite a lot of people it has turned what had been a cordial professional meeting into a highly charged confrontation
7940477 this has been blown into a highly partisan debate but it was really not at all partisan we just happen to both be of the same party
7940478 you wouldnt believe some of the conversations ive had and with who ive had them
7940479 several city managers and i met with him on the lack of communication
7940480 it couldnt have come as that big of a shock to the assessors office somebody must know these numbers are coming down the pike
7940481 im hoping the assessors office when the real estate market turns again is as aggressive moving assessments back as they were in lowering them
7940482 i just want to make sure theres no overreaction to a bubble in the marketplace
7940483 in all frankness the cities should have a better idea of whats going on in their own city
7940484 please dont refer to me or look at me as a revenue stream or revenue agent
7940485 it looks as if they were overly aggressive in their reductions compared to jan 1
7940486 once we saw that professional ethics demand you to look back at all properties back to 1998
7940487 the bigger pool you use the more accurate you are
7940488 we give most of the weight to the lowest good comp because we recognize two things the market is still going down and we always give the benefit of the doubt to the property owner
7940489 today with 50 percent of properties on the market being foreclosures they are the market its like trying to ignore the 800 pound gorilla in the room
7940490 if youre a public agency and searching for money you say gus kramer is overly aggressive in assessments
7940491 if youre a homeowner and trying to make ends meet then gus kramers doing the right thing
7940492 look everybody wants to blame somebody but thats ok ive got broad shoulders they can blame me until the cows come home they know the truth and more importantly the homeowners know the truth
7940493 if you dont try to be proactive in trying to deal with the residential decline what happens is homeowners start appealing assessments and that creates more work and will cost the taxpayers in the end
7940494 if i could change places with him i would do it in a heartbeat
7940495 i think its pretty obvious that democrats need to come together and thats what were doing here at the democratic convention and hopefully that will apply to other places
7940496 you have big disappointment obviously by the clinton campaign people many years in the making and it didnt happen
7940497 so you have campaign people theyre mad theyre upset theyre hurt theyre all those things their candidate who did unbelievably well wasnt able to get over the line
7940498 i dont think its as big of a deal as everybodys making it after thursday night when baracks the nominee and running mate delaware sen joe biden its a whole new game its a whole new day
7940499 it is almost an experience of ecstasy that arises for example with the prolonged listening to russian liturgical singing
7940500 these moments were like a foretaste of the beatific vision and the communion of saints
7940501 might contribute to enhance mutual knowledge and the desire for unity
7940502 to be pilgrims means to try to enter into the spirit of the christian east and to begin to breathe as john paul ii so dreamed also with that lung of christianity
7940503 with emotion i say that i hope the day will soon come when the patriarch of moscow will be able to embrace the successor of peter
7940504 during the visit in 2006 and in a subsequent letter
7940505 patriarch alexy ii expressed his interest and support in promoting a meeting in milan in the year 2013 between christian leaders
7940506 est bamos hablando una tarde v ctor de sones sergio de analogic t y una servidora de sones tambi n de c mo nos gustaban los planetas como hab an influenciado en nuestra particular vida musical y comentando la trayectoria pensamos que realmente se merec an un d a de homenaje por lo importantes que han sido y lo que han aportado a la m sica independiente de este pa s junto con auditori decidimos hacer un coproducci n
7940507 los grupos nos han ido diciendo qu temas quieren tocar y la verdad es que la trayectoria de los planetas es tan amplia que de momento ninguno ha coincidido
7940508 bien por colaboraciones o producciones y alg n grupo nuevo como manos de topo y pumuky por eso de que ser interesante escucharles versionando
7940509 normal yo si tuviera un grupo acosar a a la organizaci n para que me dejara tocar de viaje
7940510 invitados est n se habl con j primero por tel fono y luego en el primavera sound su respuesta fue humilde se le hac a raro que alguien pensara en hacerle un homenaje a nosotros se nos hace raro que nadie se lo hubiera hecho antes
7940511 el evento no se cre con la idea de hacer m s ciudades es un homenaje a un grupo musical y como tal cre mos desde el comienzo que s lo ten a sentido hacerlo en una sola fecha y en una sola ciudad
7940512 its 95 one day a norther blows through and its 25 the next night on the third day all the leaves fall off the trees and blow to mexico
7940513 vamos a seguir trabajando para dedicar nuestros logros a sergio
7940514 about 15 guys stormed the truck shrieking and calling her name
7940515 just think less than a century ago we didnt even have the right to vote
7940516 i did it because barack obama understands that a united democratic party is a victorious democratic party in 2008
7940517 we will one day put a woman in the white house oh yes we can
7940518 lets celebrate hillary clinton and in november lets elect barack obama
7940519 i was such a proud supporter of hillary clinton but ive got to tell you right now im fired up to elect barack obama president
7940520 thank you hillary for all that you have done for us for children for women for our party and yes our country
7940521 thank you for blazing trials for others to follow and thank you for making us proud
7940522 a splurge of awe horror and delighted disgust exuding from my memory tarnished with the stain of blood lust and tragic revenge
7940523 it would be safe to say that im leaning toward that
7940524 i love britney i think she looks so beautiful right now
7940525 im really happy for her she looks amazing and she better win the vmas shes the best
7940526 i have my studio at home so when were at home we work a lot together on music
7940527 we now have between two and three new gaming sites joining up with us per week this is an unprecedented growth we really feel as though we have found a fantastic niche for our services online gaming sites are making us their first choice as we pay out faster offer them more tariffs with better unconditioned support than any of the competition we also can cater for all sized clients from a single person to well known large corporations we are constantly receiving fantastic reviews from all of our gaming clients who use our innovative payment options
7940528 our aim is simple to become the one stop shop for online gaming companies to make us of our micro and
7940529 i went from helly hansens to many mansions girls in aruba doing bellydances
7940530 while the british public is having to tighten its belts the government is spending taxpayers money on a completely frivolous project this shows how detached the labour party has become from the concerns of the british people
7940531 these blogs were voted for by the readers of more than 60 uk political blogs and the readers of total politics magazine
7940532 i never had a chance to do one scene the way it was written or the way i wanted it to be the script wasnt respected bad producers bad partners it was a terrible experience
7940533 the movie is supposed to teach us that the education of our children will mean the future of our planet all the action scenes had a goal they were supposed to be driven by either a metaphysical point of view or experience for the characters instead parts of the movie are like a bad episode of 24
7940534 fox was sending lawyers who were only looking at all the commas and the dots
7940535 fox was just trying to get a pg 13 movie im ready to go to war against them but i cant because they dont give a s t
7940536 i went into the service from the 10th grade in high school at age 17
7940537 i had a cousin when i was little who was in vietnam
7940538 i remember seeing a picture of him in battle uniform hanging on the wall in my aunts house i used to take my friends to see the picture with eyes that seemed to follow you
7940539 i had a rough life and now im trying to live a better life
7940540 since ive been in a lot of substance abuse programs i know that i could teach one of those classes
7940541 people can relate to me because ive been through it
7940542 by telling my story hopefully they will start doing the right thing drugs and alcohol only keep you down
7940543 i began looking for other drugs to calm me down like pain pills and heroin
7940544 ive tried to stop before but my heart wasnt in it til now
7940545 as an african american and a lesbian i havent been through one day without facing some sort of discrimination but this is just shocking
7940546 devo aiutare il milan a conquistare i trofei in palio questanno la societ ha fatto grandi acquisti e sheva si inserir senza senza problemi io al chelsea resto rossonero
7940547 sto meglio assicura il fuoriclasse rossonero sono nel processo finale della cura e della terapia mancano solo pochi giorni per finire la parte della fisioterapia poi potr cominciare a fare la preparazione e a mettermi a posto per cominciare la stagione penso che dopo la sosta sar pronto per cominciare a giocare
7940548 non ero pronto per andare i giochi per il resto il brasile deve sempre giocare per vincere quindi il bronzo pur essendo una medaglia non quello che tutti si aspettavano in ogni caso io credo che sia una bella impresa perch era da tanto che il brasile non riusciva a prendere una medaglia olimpica nel calcio maschile per ci manca sempre loro
7940549 diciamo che non mi spiacerebbe nemmeno vincere la coppa uefa questo gruppo ha vinto tutto quello che poteva vincere lobiettivo principale comunque sar vincere lo scudetto penso che linter sia la squadra da battere per quel che ha fatto in questi anni poi certo c la juve che si rinforzata questanno giocher anche la champions e pu fare un grande campionato e poi c sempre la roma che una squadra che gioca molto bene queste saranno le avversarie del milan durante la stagione poi c sempre qualche sorpresa la fiorentina che una squadra che gioca ormai insieme da tanto tempo e lanno scorso ha fatto un grandissimo campionato e pu sicuramente ripetersi poi vedremo se ci saranno altre sorprese
7940550 diciamo che sheva un caso un po particolare perch faceva parte del gruppo andato via e ora tornato ma in ogni caso tutti si inseriscono molto bene e credo che non ci sar nemmeno problema per sheva di ritrovarsi e riadattarsi lo spogliatoio del milan sempre stato molto bello i giocatori sono di esperienza sono vincenti non ci sono problemi di gelosie nessuno che fa casino credo che alla fine sia questo il punto di forza di questo milan avere un gruppo cos forte
7940551 non sarebbe male giocare con i miei connazionali per io sogno un milan vincente quindi ci sono i brasiliani ci sono gli italiani ci sono quelli che ci sono limportante che ci sia il sacrificio della squadra che sia per il milan
7940552 questo non lo posso dire sorride perch se qualcuno mi ha promesso ad abramovich non sono stato io ovviamente scherzo io ho sempre detto che sono contento al milan e finch il mio obiettivo lo stesso del milan io rimango qui finora sempre stato cos il mio traguardo quello di vincere quello del milan pure e si vede anche dagli sforzi che sta facendo la societ in questo senso rinforzando la squadra e facendo in modo che questa sia sempre una squadra vincente finch siamo cos io rester al milan
7940553 c da dire che il vero ritrovo del milan non c stato non abbiamo mai giocato e non ci siamo mai allenati con tutti i giocatori che fanno ora parte della rosa alcuni sono arrivati e poi sono andati alle olimpiadi altri sono arrivati dopo basti pensare che deve unirsi al gruppo ancora senderos sheva appena arrivato solo ora la squadra comincia a creare unidentit a prendere forma in ogni caso speriamo di continuare a restare imbattuti in italia durante tutto questanno
7940554 a me piace lho incontrato alcune volte abbiamo parlato e tutti quelli che hanno lavorato con lui dicono che un grandissimo allenatore ha questo carattere cos ma anche una cosa divertente a lui piace stuzzicare tanto ma a me piace
7940555 how do you trump the donald meet sir alan sugar
7940556 if you thought the donald was tough wait until you get a taste of sugar
7940557 youll save a tremendous amount if you buy the bigger ones
7940558 last year u s district judge richard story ruled the prayers could continue and said that because the county invites clergy from all denominations the practice doesnt constitute endorsement of one religion over another
7940559 the american civil liberties union is asking the 11th u
7940560 i think this is really where you pull the cover off and see what youre really looking at with the aclu
7940561 this is religious bigotry its anti free speech its everything that theyre supposed to be against
7940562 the government really has no business telling anybody how they should or should not pray
7940563 and the fact that the aclu is trying to use the power of government to tell people how to pray is just an incredible invasion of freedom and it shows that they are not about freedom and liberty at all theyre about oppression and trying to stamp out religious speech
7940564 all weve done is move new york city to denver
7940565 it would be safe to say that im leaning toward that
7940566 kevin will be remembered by fans as one of the most popular and recognizable players to ever wear the blazers uniform but to people who knew him hell be remembered as one of the warmest and biggest hearted
7940567 if youre talking about a bottom in sales it could happen late this year or early next year
7940568 if youre talking about a bottom in pricing that may take a little bit longer to hit
7940569 were not there yet but were getting some encouraging signs
7940570 but they are dealing with the headwinds of a weakening overseas situation and a stronger dollar
7940571 while the aim was not necessarily to do business i think the casualness and the lack of pretense made us all really close
7940572 ah eu n o entendo muito bem como isso funciona e se for caro como eu vou pagar
7940573 as more moderate growth in display advertising was partially offset by continued weakness in online recruitment advertising
7940574 the online growth was much worse than i thought it would be
7940575 new york times had been doing better in that area than a lot of newspaper companies but now theyre just caught up in the industry wide trend
7940576 the good news if you can call it that is that it looks like theyre trending up in august

7940585 a minha filha acordando se ela acordar far o que entender
7940586 a seu tempo daremos conhecimento do resultado em primeira m o aos familiares
7940587 i certify that to my knowledge the condensed first half financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and offer a fair and accurate picture of the net worth financial situation and earnings of the company and of the group and that the first half report on pages 3 to 5 provides a true picture of major events that occurred during the first six months of the year their impact on the financial statements the main related party transactions and a description of the main risks and areas of uncertainty for the remaining six months of the year
7940588 if i didnt have a candidate in the race which i do which is our comptroller i would really say term limits suck
7940589 ive been with him for two and a half years and this is the first ive heard of that
7940590 taken into account the expression of free will by the ossetian and abkhaz peoples
7940591 that was no easy choice to make but it is the sole chance of saving peoples lives
7940592 the most important thing was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe to save the lives of people for whom we are responsible because most of them they are russian citizens
7940593 so we had to take a decision recognising the two states as independent
7940594 this is an unconcealed annexation of these territories which are a part of georgia
7940595 since the united states is a permanent member of the security council this simply will be dead on arrival in the security council
7940596 we all have tears in our eyes we feel pride for our people
7940597 they are clearly trying to empty southern ossetia from georgians which i dont think goes by any of the books that we deal with in international relations
7940598 im not finalizing that but yeah if i could tilt one way or another id tilt that way
7940599 insistir en la moderaci n salarial puede generar m s conflictividad
7940600 users should be in control of their information thats at the core of privacy
7940601 disclosure means informing users in plain language about the data collected about them and how its used choice means putting users in control of their data and giving them tools to protect it
7940602 computer programs for disabling the history of web browser when others are tracking web use and for controlling the information others can access about such use
7940603 computer programs for accessing and using the internet and the world wide web and computer programs for deleting search history after accessing web sites
7940604 it surprises us that mattel chose to direct facebook to take down scrabulous
7940605 mattels action speaks volumes about their business practices and respect for the judiciary it is even more astonishing that facebook which claims to be a fair and neutral party took this step
7940606 you might as well expect rolex to endorse those people selling on street markets worldwide
7940607 this is a way to help georgia make their web pages visible to the world
7940608 pensamos en un 38 de las nueve mil hect reas de expansi n urbana que estamos trabajando
7940609 de qu se tratan esas cu as de reas verdes si entramos en la escala de detalles finos significan unos megaparques que ser n muy dif ciles de manejar muy dif ciles de administrar que incluso en t rminos de seguridad ser complicado
7940610 el estado tendr que financiar la construcci n y mantenci n de parte de esas reas verdes
7940611 la radiaci n solar en chile hace que la instalaci n de estos sistemas sea conveniente casi en la totalidad de nuestro territorio esta es una inversi n rentable para las familias y para el pa s ya que se paga con el ahorro que se generar por la disminuci n en el consumo de combustibles f siles
7940612 claramente estamos convirtiendo la crisis que enfrentamos en una oportunidad
7940613 there is something wrong with the car i think we lost the clutch or the rear end
7940614 ive visited north korea in 1999 2004 2005 and then the last time in october 2007 so i can see the dynamic of this change
7940615 in 1999 even in pyongyang people were exhausted malnourished feeble in 2004 the situation was very different the whole city looked like one big market
7940616 there was activity everywhere on streets under the bridges from the windows of apartments
7940617 there have been a lot of changes but they are very patchy its still not a transitional economy
7940618 certain segments or layers are allowed to adopt some market driven mechanisms but the majority of the economy is being artificially preserved
7940619 its the level of specificity in the ideology thats the problem for reform
7940620 if your guiding principles were vague and adaptable it would be easier but in north korea they have official guidelines on how to do proper ostrich farming how can you now say in fact thats not the right way to do ostrich farming
7940621 north koreans were taught their whole lives that the state would provide now they have to take care of themselves
7940622 a mistake of just one word can lead a north korean to be publicly executed in this society
7940623 it is impossible to resist publicly the regime the control and suppression are beyond our imagination slaughter is still being carried out in north korea
7940624 every moment of this video is a wtf moment thats why its so good
7940625 the police rang me up and said what is going on do you want to make a complaint by friday they said people were going to make statements going to bathurst to hand out leaflets was my last recourse
7940626 i couldnt relax this completely ruined my life i jumped on a plane and came home i was climbing the walls
7940627 i started writing a document for a solicitor i went up to the solicitor and he just wasnt interested then i put it on the internet and took the leaflet to bathurst
7940628 it felt like a huge black cloud just came over me
7940629 as soon as i thought about the school i got really depressed for weeks

7940680 this is the story of our grandmothers and great grandmothers as they lived only 90 years ago remember it was not until 1920 that women were granted the right to go to the polls and vote the women were innocent and defenseless but they were jailed nonetheless for picketing the white house carrying signs asking for the vote and by the end of the night they were barely alive forty prison guards wielding clubs and their wardens blessing went on a rampage against the 33 women wrongly convicted of obstructing sidewalk traffic they beat lucy burn chained her hands to the cell bars above her head and left her hanging for the night bleeding and gasping for air they hurled dora lewis into a dark cell smashed her head against an iron bed and knocked her out cold her cellmate alice cosu thought lewis was dead and suffered a heart attack additional affidavits describe the guards grabbing dragging beating choking slamming pinching twisting and kicking the women thus unfolded the night of terror on nov 15 1917 when the warden at the occoquan workhouse in virginia ordered his guards to teach a lesson to the suffragists imprisoned there because they dared to picket woodrow wilsons white house for the right to vote for weeks the womens only water came from an open pail their food all of it colorless slop was infested with worms when one of the leaders alice paul embarked on a hunger strike they tied her to a chair forced a tube down her throat and poured liquid into her until she vomited she was tortured like this for weeks until word was smuggled out to the press so refresh my memory some women wont vote this year because why exactly we have carpool duties we have to get to work our vote doesnt matter its raining

7940833 it turns some people off but thats how mostly everybody i know speaks
7940834 its kind of strange whenever somebody goes that offends me im like wow what kind of weird opposite bizarro frame of mind do you live in cursing is just so second nature you dont even think of it as cursing any more its just your lexicon
7940835 basically its a dressed up version of making your first film it just happens to be a porn film
7940836 if youre turned on by this then we didnt do our job very well

7940856 silver star is our long term solution to the gang problems on the central coast we must have firm enforcement to keep our communities safe now but unless we pair that with serious prevention efforts we will never be tackling the root of the problem
7940857 like any education or health initiative we have to set children on the right path at an early age silver star aims to do just that through all of its programs and dedicated staff they do a great job and are worthy of praise
7940858 due to the difficult fiscal times we are facing this funding is vital to continue the services for our youth and families

7940862 keeping the central coasts military presence on the cutting edge has been a top priority of mine
7940863 from fort hunter liggett in the south to dli and nps in the north our active duty presence is vital to military readiness and im pleased to have funds included in this bill for important programs
7940864 this is another example of states being two steps ahead of the federal government with the white house and gop leadership continuing to block environmental bills states are being forced to come up with their own plans
7940865 instead of wasting time debating offshore drilling plans that are opposed by the public and which will do nothing to solve our energy problems the ocean action plan wisely promotes renewable offshore energy and ecosystem based management to ensure our ocean are being administered responsibly and protected for future generations
7940866 my father was a man of wisdom self discipline and personal integrity

7940874 earlier this week we released a beta of the android sdk
7940875 in the accompanying post i mentioned that we had to remove some apis from the platform for android 1 0 and as a result they dont appear in the 0 9 beta sdk and wont appear in 1 0 compatible sdks
7940876 at first remote applications could send arbitrary intents meaning that your google talk friends had almost the same control of your device as you did
7940877 even once that issue was resolved we recognized that we could not trust the identity of the application who sent the request
7940878 an android application using gtalkservice would be reachable from all of the users google talk friends and a flaw in that application could pose an inviting target to a malicious friend or automated malware
7940879 the reason is that we plain ran out of time
7940880 the android bluetooth api was pretty far along but needs some clean up before we can commit to it for the sdk keep in mind that putting it in the 1 0 sdk would have locked us into that api for years to come
7940881 and im just so grateful that the house didnt catch fire causing much more major damage and heartbreak
7940882 i went to a tattoo studio and asked for chinese characters that say courage strength and unity the tattoo artist assured me he was a native speaker and would translate the sentence accurately

7941058 while i appreciate the money immensely especially as a father with two kids in college the affirmation that the nyfa grant has given me is absolutely priceless all artists need to eat but perhaps almost as much we need to know that our art is touching people resonating with them this grant has told me that my work is indeed reaching people and it gives me the strength to persevere as a both composer and performer

7941061 we are pleased with our growth in revenue earned largely on the back of increased vehicle export sales margins are under pressure from lower local vehicle sales and a delayed recovery of cost inflation from the weakening rand and appreciating commodity prices
7941062 we remain volume sensitive and expect volumes to decline in the second half compared to the first half as the stock in the vehicle supply chain in the local market has increased because of the decline in sales
7941063 we have a reasonable expectation that if customers meet their planned vehicle production volumes during the second half of the year and the rand doesnt devaluate any further we will recover most of the under recovery during the second half of the year
7941064 the group is highly liquid and well positioned to support the funding of potential acquisitions without impairing its working capital requirements

7941081 this is an industry wide trend with enterprises trying to rationalize the endpoint security products and management consoles they use and endpoint security providers offering more than av capabilities to remain competitive
7941082 sophos will own a suite of technologies that addresses broad end user data protection needs
7941083 sophos will have to work hard to ensure that this premium priced deal pays off in the long term the mobile data protection market is growing fast compared with traditional end point security and with higher price points but mobile data protections higher price points will likely decrease substantially as encryption functions are bundled into endpoint suite licenses
7941084 moreover av providers including symantec and trend micro will likely accelerate their encryption end point strategies partly due to pressure from this acquisition
7941085 the sophos acquisition will likely eventually terminate ultimacos relationship with trend micro under which the two companies have used each others data loss prevention and encryption technologies
7941086 despite the ongoing convergence in these markets enterprise it buyers should not expect a rapid integration of newly acquired products into mature product releases
7941087 providers have generally been slow to integrate new technologies so that they can be actively managed by av endpoint security consoles

7941116 were making out hard core while waiting in line for margaritas
7941117 they were holding hands and were all over each other
7941118 that kind of gave him a spark for the films
7941119 hes one of those filmmakers who wants to be a musician and i think that the way his films are trying to capture little fresh moments is a cool approach
7941120 its very important to me to not let the musician try to make the song perfect
7941121 its so much more human when a musician is doing this beautiful version of a song but messes up and then continues yeah thats beautiful to me
7941122 as far as the modern world is concerned these are natural environments
7941123 its filmed in its own elements from where it came from the streets and the bars and peoples apartments
7941124 lets put the final nail in the coffin on the term music video and allow it to be something of the past because thats exactly what it is
7941125 it served its purpose very well in the 1980s and 1990s music videos time came and went
7941126 i dont think music or film has been in a more exciting place in 20 years
7941127 i was just blown away by their beauty and how raw they were
7941128 we were just getting a little bit bored of watching the music promos
7941129 we didnt have much clout or really any money so the idea was to try to find a way to get our vision out there and get people to buy into it
7941130 a significant shift in the way people are watching music film
7941131 its just one person with a guitar and a couple people banging on parking signs or whatever to try to make a song
7941132 now that the technology is here we hope to finally do it the way that people who really care about music have always wanted to see it done
7941133 the woman in my picture is returning home from the paddy field after a long day at work
7941134 she never thought a village woman could be the subject of a photograph so when i told her id like to take a picture of her she just laughed
7941135 the u s led economic downturn shows no sign of causing a recession in it spending
7941136 in subsequent years we will see reduced growth but the fundamentals remain strong emerging regions replacement of obsolete systems and some technology shifts are driving growth
7941137 organizations are switching from company owned hardware and software assets to per use service based models this will impact the industry in various ways
7941138 the projected shift to cloud computing for example will result in dramatic growth in it products in some areas and in significant reductions in other areas in general assets will be utilized with greater efficiency and we are assuming that the overall effect on market growth will be neutral we also recognize that there is considerable upside potential for higher growth
7941139 most companies updated their software systems during the period 1997 through 2001 so we are in the middle of an upgrade cycle that should extend past the end of this decade
7941140 however the replacement of systems does not automatically equate to new software market growth
7941141 many of these factors are impacting market growth as enterprises replace assets with per use services
7941142 spending in it services is being supported by two main factors
7941143 businesses are investing in improvements to internal processes aimed at reducing costs while often maintaining some of the prior interest in innovation the second factor is that globalization allows it services providers to mitigate the risk of weakening demand by operating in more markets
7941144 the market growth outside of the u s and the effects of the weak dollar are major factors in growth in u s dollar terms in addition to regional shifts a strong shift to mobile pcs is occurring

7941150 the right of citizens of the united states to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the untied states or any state on account of sex congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation

7941152 we invite your attention to the dangers which at present seem to threaten the female character with wide spread and permanent injury
7941153 the only question left to be settled now is are women persons and i hardly believe any of our opponents will have the hardihood to say they are not being persons then women are citizens and no state has a right to make any law or to enforce any old law that shall abridge their privileges or immunities hence every discrimination against women in the constitutions and laws of the several states is today null and void precisely as is every one against negroes

7941158 only with a better understanding of the transatlantic slave trade will we be able to tackle its legacies
7941159 today 12 3 million people are still forced to work against their will trafficked into slavery forced into bonded labour or born as slaves
7941160 learning about the transatlantic slave trade will help students better understand modern slavery and will hopefully inspire a new generation of abolitionists to take up the fight to stamp out slavery in all its forms
7941161 i wasnt expecting this to come back with two gold medals is just amazing i think the races have sunk in but i dont think the world record will sink in for a long long time

7941284 one bummer thing that happened was that one of the big mucky mucks in management was reviewing the game design and said they didnt like it
7941285 my opinion is that there existed some major difference of opinion between the team and a particularly influential person who didnt like the direction we were going and in the end those differences could not be resolved

7941308 i did the record back when i was on tvt records and unfortunately tvt didnt clear the song
7941309 we went to the west coast and demoed the record with the skeleton hook on the track going a little further back than that when we first made the beat in new york the studio lost the beat skillz is a big melody guy so the next morning he came back and remade the melody we remade the beat in five to 10 minutes
7941310 he jumped on top of the couch and was going crazy
7941311 he was like man imma get t pain or akon on the record
7941312 we played it for slim thug slim didnt record it

7941317 if he does ive yet to glimpse it beneath all those layers of arrogant schoolboy
7941318 there are men who would call you arrogant more readily than they would call sir michael so
7941319 perhaps it is that sir michael is more subtly arrogant
7941320 subtlety counts for nothing in my eyes if i am indeed arrogant at least i have entitlement to the condition i who have accomplished so much during my tenure in the kings service that child has never seen a world torn asunder by war and famine
7941321 and what is popularity amongst peasants balm upon the ego nothing more
7941322 not only with peasants sir princess ella fancies him and she has her fathers ear perhaps moreso than half the kings court it would not be advantageous to humiliate a man who could directly induce the king to have you put to death
7941323 you think his highness so simple minded and easily swayed that he would send me to the executioners block on the word of a sixteen year old girl i think it is you that is in danger of inciting the kings wrath with such statements not i
7941324 i didnt mean it that way sir i have only your best interests at heart
7941325 yes and i am quite sure you know what bishop trent has to say about good intentions and where they lead
7941326 i sought only to play devils advocate i just wish you would not be so careless with your life sir
7941327 the devil needs no more advocates im sure he has plenty i am a knight albert i would not be much of one if i took no risks would i carelessness as you call it is necessary when placing ones life on the line if it were not for carelessness then for lack of a more fitting definition those in my profession would be called mad
7941328 and still the stands are packed to overflowing on tournament day

7941330 yes sir there will be no error in the tournament caused by your horse
7941331 and no fault to be found with the armor either
7941332 so if i fail this day there will be no one to heap blame upon but myself
7941333 i am certain you would find someone to blame sir
7941334 did i not just say that i would bear no more veiled insults from you
7941335 it would not do to incapacitate you before you assisted me in mounting my horse
7941336 perhaps then you should strike me after you have mounted sir

7941345 you shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female it is an abomination
7941346 if there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman both of them have committed a detestable act they shall surely be put to death
7941347 or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god do not be deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals
7941348 realizing the fact that civil law is not made for a righteous man but for those who are lawless and rebellious for the ungodly and sinners for the unholy and profane for those who kill their fathers or mothers for murderers and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers
7941349 for this reason god gave them over to degrading passions for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error
7941350 mom i know the word shut up is a really bad word but saying it just feels like a massage to my mouth i dont say it to be mean at all but i say the words shut up and my mouth just feels sooooooo good i wish i could say i dont want to listen to you and the things you are saying make me want to take a nap but then it wouldnt feel like a massage so there isnt enough reason make myself say it i dont know why but i just want to be able to say shut up and enjoy it

7941361 drug release from polymeric materials often follows a burst first order kinetic profile which may not be clinically desired
7941362 traditionally the burst effect has been reduced by confining the api to a reservoir within the device but this adds complexity and cost to production
7941363 microencapsulating the drug enabled the use of simple molding processes to fabricate devices containing tens of thousands of microreservoirs and the devices exhibit constant drug release profiles equivalent to traditional reservoir devices this approach greatly simplifies production and adds tremendous flexibility to both single and multi drug devices
7941364 scivee is a very creative example of the potential for cyberinfrastructure or digital information and communication technologies to add a powerful new communication and sharing dimension to science
7941365 posters are the lingua franca for conveying new science but only appear at a conference for a day or two
7941366 postercasts now make that information easily accessible and persistent for a worldwide audience

7941368 a new age in dementia care turning evidence into practice
7941369 we expect the summit to challenge working professionals to take a new look at what they are doing in dementia care while sharing with them ways to turn research into practice
7941370 the fulfillment of jeffersons new vision of practice the living laboratory will take what carahs researchers have learned and continue to learn and train others both healthcare professionals and lay caregivers as to best practices in the field so this newfound knowledge can do the most good
7941371 our aim is to translate research into real world service
7941372 the ultimate goal is to provide older adults with functional difficulties and those with dementia and their caregivers access to the best care possible
7941373 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in the eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
7941374 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
7941375 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
7941376 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
7941377 our findings may change the way some plastic surgeons treat baggy eyes
7941378 our study showed that a component of a patients blepharoplasty procedure should almost routinely involve fat excision rather than these procedures
7941379 although baggy lower eyelids are a significant result of aging and fat expansion there are other factors that can contribute too
7941380 we recommend that surgeons evaluate each component and address them accordingly in an individualized approach to blepharoplasty

7941392 what nbc chooses to broadcast is not the olympic games they offer selected clips of selected american athletes largely in major sports sometimes hours after the event whereas if the bruised olympic ideal still means anything it means loosing yourself for a couple of weeks from the bonds of your immediate loyalties and tastes it means watching live sports you didnt know you were interested in played by countries youve never been to at three oclock in the morning
7941393 anyone with the proper nbc authorization even local stations or station groups can make changes on the fly they have the discretion and it can be done simply
7941394 i have yet to come across an unpleasant situation they try and accommodate you and make you feel welcome and make you feel comfortable its easy to question politics but its much tougher to question the people here theyve been wonderful
7941395 theres just some crazy sports my sister called me up a couple a days ago she was watching team handball she had never before seen it the steeplechase its the nuttiest sport youve ever seen the nice thing about being at the broadcast center 15 hours a day is that you actually get to follow these stories and keep up with them

7941399 this is one of the fundamental things of the olympic games in the vast vast majority of sports there is no attention there is no glamour in the four years leading up to the olympics theres only solitary dedication and then theres a moment like this
7941400 enough volleyball already there are other sports and other players worthy of coverage were showing our 6 13 yr old kids old vacation movies at this point since the only alternative is beach volleyball again whats wrong with nbc

7941413 this indicates that there may be some long term cardiovascular adjustment to digesting caffeine on a daily basis

7941504 in universe we plan to keep those elements that have made the franchise a success such as adventure and humor while breaking new ground in the relationships between mostly young and desperate explorers thrust together and far from home above all we believe the stargate itself remains an enduring icon with infinite potential as a jumping off point for telling stories

7941509 the u s led economic downturn shows no sign of causing a recession in it spending
7941510 in subsequent years we will see reduced growth but the fundamentals remain strong emerging regions replacement of obsolete systems and some technology shifts are driving growth
7941511 organizations are switching from company owned hardware and software assets to per use service based models this will impact the industry in various ways
7941512 the projected shift to cloud computing for example will result in dramatic growth in it products in some areas and in significant reductions in other areas in general assets will be utilized with greater efficiency and we are assuming that the overall effect on market growth will be neutral we also recognize that there is considerable upside potential for higher growth
7941513 most companies updated their software systems during the period 1997 through 2001 so we are in the middle of an upgrade cycle that should extend past the end of this decade
7941514 however the replacement of systems does not automatically equate to new software market growth
7941515 many of these factors are impacting market growth as enterprises replace assets with per use services
7941516 spending in it services is being supported by two main factors
7941517 businesses are investing in improvements to internal processes aimed at reducing costs while often maintaining some of the prior interest in innovation the second factor is that globalization allows it services providers to mitigate the risk of weakening demand by operating in more markets
7941518 the market growth outside of the u s and the effects of the weak dollar are major factors in growth in u s dollar terms in addition to regional shifts a strong shift to mobile pcs is occurring
7941519 this is an industry wide trend with enterprises trying to rationalize the endpoint security products and management consoles they use and endpoint security providers offering more than av capabilities to remain competitive
7941520 sophos will own a suite of technologies that addresses broad end user data protection needs
7941521 sophos will have to work hard to ensure that this premium priced deal pays off in the long term the mobile data protection market is growing fast compared with traditional end point security and with higher price points but mobile data protections higher price points will likely decrease substantially as encryption functions are bundled into endpoint suite licenses
7941522 moreover av providers including symantec and trend micro will likely accelerate their encryption end point strategies partly due to pressure from this acquisition
7941523 the sophos acquisition will likely eventually terminate ultimacos relationship with trend micro under which the two companies have used each others data loss prevention and encryption technologies
7941524 despite the ongoing convergence in these markets enterprise it buyers should not expect a rapid integration of newly acquired products into mature product releases
7941525 providers have generally been slow to integrate new technologies so that they can be actively managed by av endpoint security consoles

7941564 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7941565 clearly we feel that there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified those agencies

7941598 the australian funding was provided to the hellenic red cross special emergency fund for victims of fire for the general purpose of helping with the relief effort
7941599 immediately after the fires the municipality asked us to use this money for construction of a town hall because it was the request of all the local representatives
7941600 i remember when i went to zaharo i was received warmly and made an honorary citizen
7941601 i was asked to do this and it is something i agreed to do
7941602 when we found out from the australian government something was not ok with the permits it was too late and the project had started
7941603 however i requested on 20 june 2008 from the municipality of zaharo that all work should be stopped on this project until the situation was cleared up
7941604 i declare categorically that the intent of the greek red cross was and is relief for the fire victims and if someone has acted illegally in this particular instance we reserve every legal right

7941608 it would be a big mistake if the us believes that it can carry out a search of our home as it pleases just as it did in iraq
7941609 north korean leader kim jong il seems to have make a strategic decision that he will no longer continue negotiations with the bush administration
7941610 when the six party talks has sic degenerated into a circus where the strong bullies the weak as it pleases whats the use of the six party structure
7941611 landmark agreements have been concluded with every expectation that everybody will sign up
7941612 happily all political parties in the country have acknowledged culpability in this violence
7941613 i acknowledge the inordinate delay in opening this session of parliament hoping you will appreciate the delay owed to a praiseworthy search for peace and greater amity for our nation
7941614 as i have said before ive always supported this idea because it is the kmts tradition having the president double as party chairman helps the party develop and helps the administration push its policy
7941615 but you the president should not allow the party headquarters to decide on all the policies instead you should establish a democratic platform where the party headquarters the legislature and the administration can negotiate with each other
7941616 the president should serve as the person who makes the final decision since he also doubles as party chairman he should take full responsibility for decisions of both the kmt and the government
7941617 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7941618 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7941619 that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7941620 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause
7941621 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7941622 let there be no mistake about it we are united

7941640 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again
7941641 my feeling is its a group of people five or six people they dont like the former prime minister they dont like me and up to now they want to overthrow the government which is illegal
7941642 i have so many ways and means to get rid of this thing but i think the country has enough problems
7941643 soft and gentle we will ask them to come out no weapons
7941644 i wont leave until there is a political change if you want me to leave you will have to kill me and take my body out of here
7941645 as in normal practice merrill lynch is cooperating with authorities
7941646 we may consider detaining him if he cannot clearly explain the transactions
7941647 an expert instructed huang to open her account at a small merrill lynch branch in a community in miami she opened a trust account with a passport issued by a third country to avoid triggering alerts of possible money laundering activity
7941648 the fsc and the ministry of justice should demand that merrill lynch provide details and information on huang and chen accounts the fsc should revoke merrill lynchs operating license if the bank refuses to cooperate
7941649 the ministry has no right to seek to determine if an individual has foreign nationality unless the individual is proved to have engaged in illegal activities
7941650 last april the changpin power plant was found to be unfit for development however taipower found a loophole in the law and withdrew the project before the committee could make its recommendation to the eia panel
7941651 this is like a defendant trying his luck with different judges until he gets a favorable verdict the epa and state owned taipower are wasting taxpayers money
7941652 this year taipower refiled the power plant proposal as a new case with few changes to the construction plan in an attempt to go through the eia process again as a first phase project
7941653 hung du alishan international development corp the potential developer of a hotel on top of alishan which also received a negative recommendation from its eia committee recently withdrew its proposal from the epa yesterday too
7941654 this is like a defendant trying his luck with different judges until he gets a favorable verdict if the epa allows this to happen other developers are bound to follow suit
7941655 in the meantime the epa and state owned taipower are wasting taxpayers money
7941656 building more coal burning power plants should not be part of taiwans future the government should practice what it preaches by reducing carbon emissions and electricity consumption
7941657 cutting back on carbon emissions has been a goal of the taichung city government since last year and the municipal authorities will from now on take concrete action by asking citizens not to have barbecues in parks or other public open spaces during the festival
7941658 barbecuing is not good for the health and goes against global eco friendly efforts
7941659 the city government will do its best to stop people from having barbecues in parks streets or grassy areas during the mid autumn festival
7941660 relations between taiwan and japan have grown stably over the past eight years my predecessors lo fu chen and ko made very impressive achievements and i will spare no effort to promote relations between taipei and tokyo based on those achievements
7941661 the take home message for women is that whether you are hooked on caffeine or not if you need a boost coffee improves your mental alertness and can have a calming affect on your heart rate
7941662 in addition a large coffee has more than enough caffeine to see these changes
7941663 this indicates that there may be some long term cardiovascular adjustment to digesting caffeine on a daily basis
7941664 for people at risk for high blood pressure if youre a habituated coffee drinker reducing your caffeine intake would be an effective way of potentially reducing your blood pressure

7941701 i have fought the good fight i have finished the race i have kept the faith
7941702 i have signed decrees on the recognition of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia
7941703 taking into account the freely expressed will of the ossetian and abkhaz people
7941704 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
7941705 but our insistent proposals to the georgian side to reach an agreement with abkhazia and south ossetia on the renunciation of force remained unanswered
7941706 unfortunately they were ignored also by nato and the un
7941707 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7941708 we will take any decision including up to a complete break in relations
7941709 this is a clear indication that people of all races have rejected the communal politics of barisan nasional it is a clear endorsement of our reform agenda we are on track to take over the government
7941710 we are concerned by indiscriminate weapons fire by sudanese government forces on the kalma internally displaced persons camp in south darfur sudan
7941711 attacks on vulnerable populations in sudan are deplorable and violate international law
7941712 we call on the government of sudan to thoroughly investigate this incident and ensure that such actions are not repeated
7941713 the united states deplores all violence in darfur and reminds the government of sudan and all parties of their commitment to peace under the darfur peace agreement
7941714 they were surprised by heavy gunfire from within the camp there was an exchange of fire and a number of victims
7941715 sudanese forces faced huge resistance with a large number of citizens blocking the entry of the forces with barricades civilians were brought into the streets as human shields

7941718 the government is committed to ensuring all possible measures for the security of the diplomatic community
7941719 they should take a low profile their movements should be restricted during this period
7941720 vad r det f r fel p den socialdemokratiska kulturpolitiken som f rts under perioden 1994 2006

7941722 a strict curfew remains in force all over the kashmir valley
7941723 we appeal to the people of kashmir to continue peaceful protests
7941724 we strongly condemned the excessive use of force against the unarmed protesters
7941725 during three months of violent protests in jammu police have killed three hindus just three hindus
7941726 and in just two weeks these people have killed more than 30 people muslims this simple mathematics tells you india treats us like slaves
7941727 people had a stiff upper lip about it and they were resigned to their fate they were properly terrified
7941728 i think its fair to say there was muffled consternation in the first few seconds
7941729 people were clearly suffering with the shock of it but on the whole people had a stiff upper lip about it and they were resigned to their fate they were properly terrified
7941730 they thought they were going to meet their maker and thats not an exaggeration
7941731 construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1 8 by comparison to the same period last year
7941732 the housing ministry initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7941733 there is a deliberate policy aimed at making a separation with the palestinians impossible and this will risk forcing us to live in a single bi national state
7941734 there were already individual cases where sherpas were invited to work in mountain huts but illegally and they were caught and the cabin manager was penalized because they were here without a permit
7941735 so they came to me because ive spent a lot of time in nepal and know a lot of people there and asked if i could do something
7941736 the prerequisite is that they work in the trekking business as a guide in a lodge or as the owner of a lodge
7941737 when you travel around nepal you can tell now which lodges are managed by people who were in austria from a hygiene point of view from the way theyre managed the cleanliness theyre just better
7941738 now its okay but at the beginning it was very hard
7941739 i think its really about the money to be able to feed their family
7941740 what i get here is big money in nepal its small money
7941741 for them its like winning the lottery after three or four months theyre going home with 5 000 euros us 7 360 thats 450 000 to 500 000 nepalese rupees
7941742 i just want to help these people ive been to nepal so often and had so many lovely experiences so i want to give back a little of what i received
7941743 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
7941744 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7941745 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
7941746 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
7941747 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
7941748 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
7941749 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
7941750 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7941751 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces
7941752 go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side
7941753 until we have a deal we dont have a deal
7941754 what i understand is that the iraqi parliament will not pass this agreement
7941755 at this moment the iraqi government and parliament are not ready for such a deal which will face a lot of hurdles
7941756 we will not accept to put the lives of our sons on the line by guaranteeing absolute immunity for anybody whether iraqis or foreigners
7941757 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
7941758 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position
7941759 whenever you win wars your troops come home and our troops will be coming home but it will be dictated by the conditions on the ground and the success or the lack of success
7941760 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them

7941762 by the time we radioed in that the culprit was wearing black clothes he was wearing white or red
7941763 he cannot be 100 percent cured but his life quality has improved
7941764 he fought for this country and helped open some doors
7941765 he helped show people the idea of black people as second class citizens was wrong
7941766 the health and educational situation is critical for many indigenous peoples
7941767 need to examine the fundamental rights of the 23 million people of the republic of china taiwan to participate meaningfully in the activities of the united nations specialized agencies

7941769 people here are very angry and it would not surprise me if soon they started seizing state institutions if the president keeps pushing his reforms violence will get harsh very harsh
7941770 this division is not new but it is more radical than before as well as the east west division we have an increasing city countryside division
7941771 this constant violence will not cease we are hearing confrontational language from the president and the opposition it seems they are all pushing for more violence
7941772 the bolivia of the traditional conservative right wing governments and the peasant one the poor one the indigenous one that has been in a state of submission for years the latter is the one that is now running the political scene and this is provoking a harsh reaction from the bosses that cannot stand their servants the indians to be ruling for them this is simply humiliating
7941773 if there is inflation it is because the elderly poor are now having money to eat chicken
7941774 people here are very angry and it would not surprise me if soon they started seizing state institutions if the president keeps pushing his reforms violence will get harsh very harsh

7941780 we want to have another look at it because its a positive constructive idea lets see if it works
7941781 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a champions league qualifier i know people expect us to get through but its not as if were playing a mickey mouse team
7941782 the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages we had a tough match against anderlecht a few years ago so im not surprised liege caused us problems
7941783 they caught us a bit cold in the first leg but you have to remember that they had gone something like 30 games unbeaten in their own league and they are a club with european pedigree
7941784 we didnt play well and we know well have to improve at anfield everyone knows how important it is for our season to get into the group stage its always a funny time for us to have such a massive game before weve got going in the season some of our results have reflected that
7941785 we lost at home to ak graz in the year we won the competition and had a narrow win in the last minute against maccabi haifa two years ago so anyone thinking well win comfortably knows thats very dangerous
7941786 i believe im at the top of my game right now and like any player i want to win things
7941787 i dont want to look back on my career and think i only won the carling league cup i want to push on and win more and thats one of the reasons why i came to liverpool another reason is the fact that ive always been a fan and if i could win something with this team it would be a dream come true
7941788 the questions posed to mr bonds by two different prosecutors at his grand jury appearance were imprecise redundant overlapping and frequently compound
7941789 even though this banned substance has no way of enhancing performance it is still listed as an international olympic committee ioc banned substance causing chang a lifetime of regret

7941799 when you win in three sets it is a good result
7941800 i had some difficult moments in the match so that is going to help me be prepared for the pressure moments later on
7941801 i tried to keep my level up i tried to hurry him
7941802 he was hitting his forehand really hard and making me do a bit of running it was a decent test and i came through it pretty well
7941803 in the first set i felt like i was playing against a wall
7941804 in the second set i told myself to just play your game and dont give up

7941811 the ratio between job seekers and employment opportunities was 1 1 three years ago when taiwans economy awoke but now with the economic downturn the ratio has risen to 2 1 meaning that two job seekers are competing for one job vacancy
7941812 the figures indicated potential buyers believed real estate properties are overpriced and they would rather adopt a wait and see attitude before entering any deals
7941813 i know what the people of andhra want youth power is my power and will help me win it is my duty to pay respects to the people of the state and i am hungry to serve the people
7941814 the state does not lack intellectuals but there is no proper channel to guide them todays political parties are involved in blame game activities the aim of our party is that there should be equal ooportunites to all upliftment of youth and women development of industries
7941815 when the time was right for me i attached myself with blood bank activities and other charitable works now it is the time for me to plunge into politics and take the responsibility this inspiration has come for me after seeing you and also your strength

7941819 donald bradman gave australia pride and hope at a time when through the depression and wwii we really needed it
7941820 he would have been the stand out player whatever generation he played in
7941821 the worlds spiritual home of cricket don being by far the best cricketer of all time
7941822 it will not only be the bradman museum but it will be the international cricket hall of fame whose captain will be don bradman and the team will be obviously the best
7941823 the initial team of 12 people will be from all over the world i dont know exactly who they will be but they will include people like sachin tendulkar from india
7941824 he gave australia pride and hope at a time when through the depression and wwii we really needed it
7941825 we had a tiny population then and the fact that he could go out and be the worlds best gave a lot of hope to australia
7941826 i think its one of the reasons why australia does so well in sport now we can approach any sport and challenge the worlds best

7941831 economic growth is almost entirely dependent on the export sector
7941832 the uniformity of us dollar strength across the region also suggests only limited scope for individual central banks to cap their currencies
7941833 after all the rumours we have finally and quite literally unwrapped australias first surface table now we just have to figure out what to do with it
7941834 we actually had our first app with our own content up and running within 20 minutes staff cant stop walking up to the table and playing with the demos that were included
7941835 we are very excited that australia is one of the first countries outside the us to receive a microsoft surface for internal evaluation and exploration
7941836 its about engagement with young people and with the wider community
7941837 its also about what engineering is the importance of it and to simply excite some interest in it
7941838 we have to make it fun for them but not talk down to them we want it to be serious fun
7941839 but the central bank as it did in the past would not let the local currency drop too much too fast
7941840 while the us dollar might gain further its room is becoming increasingly limited given domestic economic and financial woes
7941841 asian currencies as a group should continue to strengthen over time not only against a basket of currencies but also against the us dollar
7941842 what is required is a new human order of true men and women who will live reality and never turn away

7941851 we cant go back and put women in big old heavy sweatshirts
7941852 where were going to win is with those items that are truly versatile that a person can dress up or dress down and still be able to express their own personal style
7941853 speaking honestly when i was younger i really wanted the fame thing
7941854 it was part of the game of being a fashion designer but that doesnt turn me on anymore what turns me on my soul is making cool clothes and being part of a company where i can actually see the difference im making im not just spinning my wheels and getting the clothes into five stores in america
7941855 pebble beach and those kinds of trophy assets its clear those were crazy deals but now theyre buying things that are earnings enhancing and using cash thats been generating no income to do it
7941856 its a very opportune time for japanese companies looking to make acquisitions overseas
7941857 in general m amp a doesnt benefit the acquirer because it tends to occur during boom times when management is overconfident and they pay too much
7941858 japan is unique because they remember their massive bubble era failures and have such low confidence that they are being extremely careful to do deals that make sense
7941859 at the beginning i wasnt sure if i had an interest in designing or not but im not a highly educated person and if you dont have an education you have to be self reliant and have a skill so my skill was making clothes
7941860 to have gotten to where i am now has been i believe a matter of persistence
7941861 if someone looks at a piece of clothing and is able to tell at once that it is a shiatzy chen piece then i know i have succeeded
7941862 im probably more of a language artist than a video artist that gives you an idea of the a gap between what i do and what whoever makes terms up thinks that i do
7941863 if its challenging to the viewer its challenging to myself
7941864 i have to think does this make sense is this insane is this nonsense is there something here that makes me think even though i dont know what it is im going through the same questions that perhaps the viewer goes through
7941865 it may be difficult it may be what does this mean but for the most part i try to have everything available
7941866 it was somewhat by happenstance that it occurred but i was ready for it
7941867 i really move back and forth sometimes delving in technology but typically not super high end technology
7941868 i generally look for some sort of fallibility some kind of crack in technology
7941869 may have to do with opening up time which is significantly different than most music videos which are sort of trying to make things happen as quickly as possible this isnt talking about apples and oranges its like talking about fruit and meat
7941870 the art market has destroyed artists as far as im concerned
7941871 i think that the prices are completely and totally inflated all misrepresentational and bad for long term creativity and reality people
7941872 when things sell for millions and millions of dollars and its just because people have the wool pulled over their eyes it creates a false idea of value
7941873 and i can speak backwards i learned it for some of my works
7941874 we will make further announcements on the reform and try to find ways to make management more efficient
7941875 there have been some issues raised about overlapping of the functions of some state run firms since an average 10 new public firms have been established every year from 2003
7941876 usually in a contest the guys who spin the most win but i have been spinning some big threes and sevens and i was winning yesterday so i think its a great comp you dont have to do a 1260 or something to win
7941877 the fallout of the credit crisis will continue to dampen the global economy over the next 24 months with sharply escalated oil and food prices beginning to test inflation expectations
7941878 this presents huge socio political as well as economic risks in the next three to five years opportunities may be limited in such a scenario

7942028 this is the first time ive ever had security senators dont matter
7942029 the only reason i accepted the nomination so the delaware delegation could be moved up front
7942030 theres still 44 senators older than me i want you to know that i dont give a damn if you remember anything else
7942031 im confident that with an obama presidency we will have comprehensive immigration reform in the first term but its not going to be easy
7942032 an important part of the answer is not to have so many people who do not have legal status
7942033 whole detention system that is wrong and causing lots of suffering
7942034 although desirable i think it would be difficult to include fixing the detention and immigration judicial system in comprehensive immigration reform because it really wasnt a critical part of what came about last time
7942035 it doesnt mean that it shouldnt get done im just not sure if thats the best vehicle for it if the goal is to include these issues in comprehensive immigration reform then we have lots of work to do to make them front and center in this debate
7942036 we knew the senate bill was deeply flawed but we believed the legalization component for the 12 million immigrants was decent and the family reunification provisions could be fixed before the final passage
7942037 weve got to start drawing a very clear line were for the people and theyre against the people
7942038 if its going to be hillary tonight or biden tomorrow night i dont know but somebodys got to take the gloves off and ask the question are you better off today than you were four or eight years ago

7942042 she did it yesterday at the new york delegation breakfast
7942043 shes got to hit it even harder tonight that this is not about me this is about the country
7942044 you can see the impact in training they have a really good mentality and they are really happy especially mascherano and lucas because of their medals i think it will be positive for the team
7942045 if everything is okay maybe they could play this weekend they will be around and we will decide but they cannot play in the champions league
7942046 theyre not playing this game so they have time in training and theyll be okay
7942047 everyone knows what a good professional he is he is a nice boy and a good player so everyone is pleased for him its amazing
7942048 they could be the best team weve faced if you look at some of the other games we were much better than the opposition
7942049 but if we do the right things we can be on top of them at anfield we will try to play at a high tempo and im sure theyll try to play on the counter attack i think it will be more or less similar to the first game but the difference will be anfield
7942050 we have to improve at everything set pieces and open play we had a bad game the best thing was the result but this time we have to play better and we have to score goals
7942051 you can know a team but sometimes you dont know exactly how they will play until you get on the pitch you can watch videos and things like that but you do not always know now we know a lot about them so it will be easier to not make any mistakes
7942052 but i wasnt surprised by them i was surprised at how badly we played
7942053 we have a lot of confidence that we will go through we are at anfield and we have to improve and we will improve
7942054 we have training tomorrow and then well decide on the one or two players who have had problems
7942055 if you ask me if i am considering this option the answer is no i am just thinking about winning

7942060 with the advent of mp3s illegal downloading and piracy and the proliferation of do it yourself record labels many musicians and labels have decided the best way to reach fans in the digital age is to release some or all of their music for free

7942062 we do have banners and are accepting advertising but thats just to cover our hosting domain costs we both work on the site in our own time because we enjoy working on the site and finding new music
7942063 there are no plans to ever charge for any part of newmusicalorder org
7942064 that would be at odds with our free and legal music philosophy and i cant see that changing

7942720 it certainly is in violation of its commitments to the six party framework certainly in violation of the principle of action for action
7942721 what we require the other five parties require is a verification package in order for us to go forward in delisting north korea
7942722 the north is well aware of this we have been very clear and consistent on this point so there should be no surprise for north korea what is required of it
7942723 to see how things play out in the coming weeks
7942724 the us is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the dprk north korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq

7942732 sophos will own a suite of technologies that addresses broad end user data protection needs
7942733 sophos will have to work hard to ensure that this premium priced deal pays off in the long term the mobile data protection market is growing fast compared with traditional end point security and with higher price points but mobile data protections higher price points will likely decrease substantially as encryption functions are bundled into endpoint suite licenses
7942734 moreover av providers including symantec and trend micro will likely accelerate their encryption end point strategies partly due to pressure from this acquisition
7942735 the sophos acquisition will likely eventually terminate ultimacos relationship with trend micro under which the two companies have used each others data loss prevention and encryption technologies
7942736 despite the ongoing convergence in these markets enterprise it buyers should not expect a rapid integration of newly acquired products into mature product releases
7942737 providers have generally been slow to integrate new technologies so that they can be actively managed by av endpoint security consoles

7942763 the u s led economic downturn shows no sign of causing a recession in it spending
7942764 in subsequent years we will see reduced growth but the fundamentals remain strong emerging regions replacement of obsolete systems and some technology shifts are driving growth
7942765 organizations are switching from company owned hardware and software assets to per use service based models this will impact the industry in various ways
7942766 the projected shift to cloud computing for example will result in dramatic growth in it products in some areas and in significant reductions in other areas in general assets will be utilized with greater efficiency and we are assuming that the overall effect on market growth will be neutral we also recognize that there is considerable upside potential for higher growth
7942767 most companies updated their software systems during the period 1997 through 2001 so we are in the middle of an upgrade cycle that should extend past the end of this decade
7942768 however the replacement of systems does not automatically equate to new software market growth
7942769 many of these factors are impacting market growth as enterprises replace assets with per use services
7942770 spending in it services is being supported by two main factors
7942771 businesses are investing in improvements to internal processes aimed at reducing costs while often maintaining some of the prior interest in innovation the second factor is that globalization allows it services providers to mitigate the risk of weakening demand by operating in more markets
7942772 the market growth outside of the u s and the effects of the weak dollar are major factors in growth in u s dollar terms in addition to regional shifts a strong shift to mobile pcs is occurring

7942787 its a construct by the media and white people to feel more comfortable politically

7942799 ive been taking batting practice taking ground balls and throwing i was doing sprints and then my foot swelled up
7942800 i dont know i think ill be resting and undergoing rehabilitation ill be staying off it the right foot
7942801 its only a few hours trip to brooklyn so after i come home i might be going to brooklyn to see a few games
7942802 both incidents have left the victims completely traumatised but this mornings robbery was particularly violent and has left one of the men with injuries to his arm and hand
7942803 the suspects quite clearly have no regard for their victims whatsoever and will do whatever it takes to execute this crime
7942804 we are well aware of the public concerns here and the danger faced by all who are involved in this business
7942805 we would like to re assure communities that we have a significant number of force resources now deployed including firearms officers and we are working round the clock to trace those responsible
7942806 its a big store and it attracts a lot of people
7942807 on the weekends its packed and in crowded atmospheres people sometimes prey upon the innocent
7942808 we dont discuss safety and security issues in the store
7942809 just about the time that slipknot should have been playing this is what we got
7942810 i swear to you on my love for slipknot this is not a joke its the 100 truth
7942811 they shouldt change they should make another iowa im sure the next album will sound like the old ones
7942812 every album we have made is a statement about that space in time i think this era is the most mature most beautiful and the most powerful we have made an album that will show the road behind the road ahead and where we are as men i think its the best thing ive ever made and i challenge anyone to prove me wrong
7942813 when we were starting out we had all these strikes against us
7942814 we were from iowa there were nine of us we wore masks we wore coveralls we played metal hard metal
7942815 it was tough getting people to come out to des moines
7942816 i dont know why its a pretty cool place but a amp r dudes jaded folks from los angeles or new york its hard to get them to come to iowa
7942817 we also took a lot of shit from other bands
7942818 when we hit the road with ozzfest in 1999 i heard a lot of condescending remarks from other musicians they were saying
7942819 our music stood up were much more popular now and it wasnt because of our image it was the music
7942820 its our fourth album and we wanted to do something different
7942821 you cant put out the same record over and over again at the same time you can definitely still tell that this is slipknot
7942822 im looking forward to the expressions on peoples faces when they hear the new record
7942823 theres very very heavy stuff on this album and its gonna blow peoples minds but im also excited for them to see the stuff thats different on this album the more experimental music no ones going to expect it
7942824 i think everyone just went in with an open mind we would always listen to everyones ideas and if they worked they worked if they didnt they didnt
7942825 this time we really tried to build off the ideas really tried to work on them i think it helped that so many of us were able to spend time doing our own thing too just writing with different people really makes a difference in how you think about music when we finally came together we were able to bring that to the mix
7942826 it gave us more time and energy to experiment in the studio i was able to come up with more guitar sounds than ever
7942827 our shows were like sporting events wed put everything into them and then afterwards wed be fucking exhausted we werent going to pile into a van all nine of us and then drive all night to the next show wed have fallen asleep at the wheel and died
7942828 those early shows were rough but i loved the small stage
7942829 there was something intimate about it it was like an old school punk show which is what i grew up with
7942830 it was 8 000 degrees youre bumping into people youre tripping over equipment those small stages have low ceilings so the heats trapped real low right at your head those shows are about survival not about playing
7942831 shawn used to bring chop saws on stage to grind pipes for sparks
7942832 once a chunk broke off and sent a kid to the hospital but people who got hurt at our shows were cool about it wed follow them to the hospital and sign some shirts and shit it was like you know no harm no foul
7942833 wed be on tour and fire marshals would show up with camcorders and accuse us of all kinds of crazy bullshit theyd say we heard you set yourselves on fire
7942834 sid and clown would spray each other with lighter fluid and then theyd pull out lighters that got us in trouble one promoter would call the next theyd warn each other and theyd hit us with do not lists we were castrated
7942835 sometimes we hate each other sometimes we hate the world sometimes we just hate our own lives but when we get together something monstrous happens and we pull this amazing sound out of all that energy
7942836 we believe in world domination and this is the band thats gonna get us there
7942837 you know we went from being some local band in a basement to selling millions of records
7942838 its going to be a decade since the first album came out im so happy and amazed and proud and thankful for where this band has gone ive gotten to see the world and i get paid for it id have done it for free
7942839 i think the best part about being in this band has been getting exposure to the rest of the world you realize that everything in the world is the same people feel the same they have the same desires hopes fears being worldly is a gift that i dont ever want to give back it changes your life especially when youre from a small town in iowa
7942840 i always knew wed go far i just knew it
7942841 there was no way this band was going to fail but i never knew wed reach the heights weve come to weve traveled the world so many times all the different countries are like our second homes to this day it still blows me away that we took this crazy idea and made it a global sensation
7942842 every album we have made is a statement about that space in time i think this era is the most mature most beautiful and the most powerful we have made an album that will show the road behind the road ahead and where we are as men i think its the best thing ive ever made and i challenge anyone to prove me wrong

7942956 if we cover up pain all the time we may miss an important signal
7942957 when people take ibuprofen aspirin ketoprofen or naproxen sodium they figure since those drugs are otc they must be safe as a result they overdo them or do not pay attention to interactions with other medications while the benefits of these drugs are enormous and real so too are the risks of gastrointestinal upset and bleeding

7942991 he just went through it where it had started everything in his life as a young kid the patterns he was crying sobbing actually absolutely sobbing he just said i dont have cancer
7942992 he was terrified i still remember the look on his face it was a very hard moment for him as it was for me hearing it
7942993 i could just see a really broken unwell man at that point i found it really quite hard to get angry

7942996 perhaps i feel a little bit foolish in this hindsights a fabulous thing but im trying not to beat myself up
7942997 in the middle of the night he was in so much pain i would put towels in the microwave to try and give him some relief in his back
7942998 before i stopped working to care for him i was busy hed have doctors appointments when i couldnt be there and he would say its fine you dont need to be there
7942999 or i would just drop him off at the hospital
7943000 were only talking two weeks since admitting his lies theres a lot of stuff to deal with

7943007 biologists of all stripes acknowledge an amazing ability of various plants and animals to adapt to specialized niches for example scientists have recently discovered a new species wholly unrelated to any previously known species which survives on the lips of one particular type of lobster morris 1995 although this form of evolution is remarkable it also leaves the creatures vulnerable to even a slight change in the environment the same specialization that made these creatures so dependent on the success of a relatively small group of lobsters makes them less adaptable to relatively small changes in the global environment for example this particular group of lobsters may decline or migrate to a less desirable location threatening the existence of their tiny lip dwellers
7943008 the price of sawdust has soared since 2006 up from about 25 a ton to more than 100 in some markets blame the housing slump fewer new homes mean fewer trees cut for use in construction which leads to less sawdust and other wood waste driving up the price

7943019 you can well imagine a parent flying with a child seated next to somebody in the extreme case seated next to somebody watching pornography
7943020 theres always going to be someone who probably steps over the line whats interesting is the question is how do we deal with this person
7943021 im not too happy about it because i needed to get paid today
7943022 most indications are that gustav will be an extremely dangerous hurricane in the northwestern caribbean sea in a few days
7943023 still a long way from oil and gas infrastructure but gas traders will be keenly focused on direction magnitude of this summers first storm to potentially impact energy markets

7943031 executive complacency could be attributed to the improvement in dr testing successes
7943032 its more likely that dr is still just not seen as a basic requirement for companies there also havent been as many current events lately that spur people into thinking about disaster recovery
7943033 its obvious if you just take a look at cell z123 thats exactly what i was asking for
7943034 once the team management and the swimmers and nzoc get back in the country well meet with them and review everything and decide at that stage whether any further action is necessary
7943035 im just really keen to make sure something silly like this doesnt overshadow the incredible performances that they had
7943036 whether its a cycling team or a swimming team its made pretty clear to them what the code of conduct is and clearly something like this probably breaches that
7943037 for something like this to put a dampener on it is a real shame
7943038 inappropriate and foolhardy behaviour at the end of a long campaign
7943039 its something that both swimming new zealand and the nzoc will have to address its not something that can be ignored
7943040 any time protocol isnt followed it has to be addressed
7943041 contact doesnt see any significant upside in the 2009 financial year
7943042 so with a lack of growth the shares look fully priced around current levels
7943043 that would be a valuable contribution to the south island in the next month to six weeks as the coldest part of the winter rolls out
7943044 shutting up about his allegations of wrong doing against simunovich fisheries
7943045 i demand that either the member gives me the evidence now or he apologises what he is saying is baseless and more important it is the subject of a serious defamation case for which at the time all the way through december last year tvnz and radio new zealand argued that they had never at any point sought to impugn my integrity the member is now seeking to litigate a sub judice matter in the house
7943046 its an absolute disgrace madam speaker that you shut down an mp asking questions an absolute outrage
7943047 fairfax claims these cuts are about adapting to new technologies and platforms but the way to deal with these changes is to increase the size of newsrooms and compete on the quality of news
7943048 but we are also non compromising on the quality of our editorial content
7943049 the truth is that if the whole world did what new zealand is doing in this emissions trading scheme then the world would fail because the action needed is a lot stronger than that
7943050 however on balance and given the very significant changes we have achieved we have decided that it is better to make a start than to do nothing
7943051 i thought there would be more glass on the floor
7943052 it was pretty cosmetic damage but it was enough to make it unsaleable i hate to see good food go to waste so i called the food bank
7943053 its a huge day for us as a club in so many ways
7943054 this is a match we have to win to remain in contention for the playoffs were all disappointed with the performance against the dragons but all we can worry about now is preparing properly to take on penrith
7943055 at the same time its important for the club as a whole and for the fans to honour ruben logan and wairangi who have all made such a big contribution to the warriors
7943056 we have a strong balance sheet and the business is in great shape to tackle the challenges of the current operating environment
7943057 we are acutely aware of the need to stimulate demand and will continue to sharpen domestic and short haul prices

7943071 the courses are in the worst condition ive ever seen
7943072 if you people cant put our courses in better condition i think theres something wrong with your plans what put our courses in this condition tell us what happened to our courses the courses are atrocious
7943073 its going to take a couple years to see a significant improvement its going to require a long term commitment on staff on the board and on the residents and golfers were asking for 120 000 to top dress the fairways in the next month and requesting future budgeting as we move forward
7943074 its a shame that we have to go somewhere else to play when our courses are going the in direction theyre going
7943075 you really have to get on the ball or we need to get another groundskeeper another head pro to do the job
7943076 were putting a lot of rounds on these golf courses and damage is going to happen theres been a lot of talk over the years and the decision at this point was to stay the course now were asking to change the course
7943077 weve talked to other golf course superintendents and weve heard between two and three years for a significant improvement
7943078 i think playing conditions will definitely greatly improve definitely in five years well have close to pristine conditions
7943079 i am a clinton supporter but i will proudly support obama

7943101 the highest swimming speeds are about 6 3 feet per second so two swimmers finishing one hundredth of a second apart will hit the wall a little less than one inch apart to a person standing poolside this difference is not observable but is absolutely measurable both by the timing pads and by high speed cameras taking thousands of frames per second if the timing interval were cut to a tenth of a second as you suggest swimmers could be separated by a much as eight inches a large margin at the most competitive levels of swimming and still finish with the same time
7943102 i miss the competition and i miss rolling to my left and throwing the ball into the gap

7943113 do we need a myriad of open source alternatives to the proprietary software stacks or would we be better served with one or two rock solid open source alternatives
7943114 you wouldnt know if it was his first or his 30th in a low scoring ballgame he set the tone thats what he does he does it from a spot in the order that can give us a lot of energy
7943115 ive been having some good games in the late innings
7943116 i dont necessarily feel like we need to sweep them but i feel like we need to win the series
7943117 because of the media and the fans theres more energy or electricity in the ballpark but you cant bring in a pitcher an inning earlier
7943118 they dont give you two wins when you beat the yankees
7943119 any series we have with new york is going to be a big series but when we come off of a win like this i feel like everyone will show up and just have a little more energy and be able to feed off this game
7943120 its nice to win this one it hard after the first game it gets you down
7943121 weve talked about it anytime you can tie or move ahead of the greats that played the game its very humbling its something you look back and feel very honored you cherish that for sure
7943122 we were real happy with greg smith because his strike percentage was something that we just recently talked to him about improving being aggressive in the zone early be more efficient in the strike zone and he really did a nice job
7943123 the last time he came up thats what he did in kansas city
7943124 he was very aggressive and swung the bat very well i like the aggressiveness and how he attacked the balls that were in the zone
7943125 i think i pitched better tonight than i did any time this year
7943126 it show me the work im doing is paying off
7943127 its nice to know that you have one of the best pitchers in the american league or all of baseball going
7943128 of course you look at the standings and where we are at
7943129 but we try to just not think about that too much
7943130 ive thrown everything at them so i just want to execute my pitches ive got four quality pitches i can use at any time in any count im just going to pitch my game
7943131 we miss a play and it ended up costing us a ball game go to the ninth its normally a done deal for us
7943132 he had a couple outings where he struggled but to come back against these guys is pretty good
7943133 its tough to walk away with a loss but overall i was happy with the outing
7943134 i just try to take care of things i can control
7943135 thats what we shoot for two out of three and move on to the next one
7943136 theres always something you can do as a player to motivate yourself
7943137 you draw it up and the law of averages says youre going to score some runs but you cant depend on that
7943138 the toughest thing for me is to keep the ball down more consistently
7943139 its not a maybe thing youve got to do it ive got to work on that because its killing me
7943140 obviously everyone knows they are two big games theyre right behind us in this wild card push
7943141 theyve played pretty good baseball too two good teams playing good baseball
7943142 how much more fun is it october is the only thing more meaningful
7943143 i aint pitching great but i dont think im pitching as bad as its made out to be
7943144 ive pitched plenty of winnable games and ive pitched plenty of losable games in that stretch
7943145 he held them at bay even though he gave up three runs a lot of walks missed the zone a lot again he did not have his curveball he continued to hold the game close and he had some tough innings but i thought he battled pretty good
7943146 i think he was at 45 50 pitches in the third inning then he shortened the innings down and they did some first ball hitting which helped us he threw a lot of first pitch strikes
7943147 i think im trying to do too much and im trying to be too perfect
7943148 any time im on the mound i just want to take my time and make a good pitch and whatever happens happens
7943149 carlos is one of those guys who swings the bat like a five or six guy in the lineup not like a nine hole guy
7943150 hes looking like the hitter he was early in the season
7943151 hes been building toward this and hopefully he can maintain some of it
7943152 specifically the georgian military should be given the antiaircraft and antiarmor systems necessary to deter any renewed russian aggression these defensive capabilities will help to prevent this conflict from erupting again and make clear we will not allow the russians to forcibly redraw the boundaries of sovereign nations
7943153 we just did not execute well at home early and we didnt execute well on the road early weve been on a nice little roll now
7943154 she doesnt have anything wrong with her feet she just wants new shoes

7943157 ive got a lot of confidence especially with the guys hitting out there and playing defense behind me the way they are
7943158 ive been able to get down in the zone low and get a lot of ground balls and strikeouts
7943159 he gets more people to chase pitches down in the zone so you just have to be really patient and really selective at what you swing at
7943160 he hung in there pretty well against a guy that looks like he might be on his way to the cy young
7943161 boasting a glossy black surface emblazoned with a colorful motif inspired by extreme sports and graffiti art this model emanates power daring and energy with its playfulness and musky scent
7943162 in glorious pink this design evokes the imagery of a summer party leaving the somber feel of conventional laptop designs far behind with its cheerful floral motif and a floral scent the most attractive laptop for ladies
7943163 realized in a pastel green hue this graphic motif is inspired by the love and respect for nature return to the embrace of mother nature for a crisp and refreshing awakening of the senses whenever you work on your notebook
7943164 the freedom afforded by a boundless expanse of sky and the energy of breaking waves are captured perfectly on the cover of this notebook the matching invigorating aquatic scent will keep your days energized

7943168 its not easy leaving my other family the mgs team but with everybody taking time off and not having any other big projects to shift focus to it feels like this is how its supposed to be its fate
7943169 barack obama picks a loose lipped running mate who voted for the iraq war and questioned his readiness
7943170 obama says he wants a veep wholl challenge him instead he got one wholl need to tutor him
7943171 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7943172 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a tragic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
7943173 obama received his best press when it mattered the most
7943174 how could someone with his utter lack of national expertise and name identification seem to become an overnight heavyweight
7943175 no one has charged obama with wrongdoing something he has been quick to point out
7943176 we can only apologise for what was a poor performance
7943177 a defeat like this can be demoralising but weve come back from this before credit to england but we didnt apply ourselves as we should have done
7943178 it was very special but we are a long way from finishing this series
7943179 people have paid good money to come to the ground and are rightly angry not to get a proper game
7943180 its just not good enough on the field at the moment were not playing to the standard we know we are capable of
7943181 it is difficult to put a finger on weve had some injuries but there are no excuses and we know we have to perform a lot better
7943182 england are playing a dominant brand of cricket so credit to kevin and his team stuart broad bowled a fantastic spell with the new ball
7943183 there are three games left so we hope we play better as we have been way off the mark
7943184 im not going to stand here and say this is the best team weve had and its the start of great things but if we keep training hard im sure we wont be too far wide of the mark
7943185 but we need to get ourselves right and enjoy this evening because wins like this are very very special
7943186 it was one of those days for south africa but we bowled exceptionally well there was hardly a ball below 86mph which created real pressure
7943187 the list of artists and contributors who have graced the pages of arkitip now reads like a whos who of popular culture many of which received exposure in arkitip long before the mainstream took notice
7943188 yes wearing a brace can reduce your ankles ability to strengthen itself naturally
7943189 the largest surprise came from the significantly higher than anticipated level of provisions related largely to impairments in the banks corporate u s real estate portfolio
7943190 with concerns that we cannot see the end to real estate woes in the united states this material increase in credit related headwinds will weigh on bmos valuation over the coming months
7943191 obviously bmos earnings came in much lower than we expected
7943192 the impact of the deterioration in the u s housing market has affected our results and while uncertainty exists we are confident in the earnings capacity of the core franchise
7943193 i would not probably buy any of that product for at least six months
7943194 because of the type of product it is it wont be for good
7943195 but people are going to be more cautious and want to look at the labels and see where its made
7943196 people will start buying again from safeway or lucerne and then certainly theyll start buying from the chains like macs and that and then maple leaf will be the last one where well see people starting to buy them but limited
7943197 consumers really have to feel that the problem has been discovered and the solutions have been found
7943198 theyre asking more questions which is really great because were able to educate them and it sustains itself its not like a one week or a one shot deal they are coming back and becoming interested in the topic
7943199 the brush aka lill china man known in the underground for the flesh numbing properties of the pepper tree you can thank the chinaman whenever you brush up into him
7943200 charlie sheen revealed on monday that he and his wife brooke mueller are expecting their first child together
7943201 as scientists were excited about this discovery because its a fundamentally new approach to regulating what enzymes do in cells
7943202 the fact that it also offers a potentially novel use of a drug already widely in use for other applications is an unexpected bonus
7943203 understanding how the cell works should allow us to affect the activity of enzymes in one neighborhood and leave alone their identical twins in a different neighborhood in that cell
7943204 the idea is to use a pde5 inhibitor such as viagra selectively to inhibit platelet function
7943205 thanks to a fantastic team both the clock wise and counter clockwise tests went without a hitch we look forward to a resounding success when we make our first attempt to send a beam all the way around the lhc

7943211 ive just been so busy covering the ins and outs of the olympics that i really havent had a chance to consume myself with such mundane trivialities as getting presents for my children
7943212 i had designs on going to the great wall or to one of the many cool markets in beijing to purchase some gifts for the kids but i just didnt have a chance
7943213 obviously when i got to the airport i was like fuck i totally bricked on it i mean im not the kind of self important schmuck that would come home without presents for my kids you know so i went to the souvenir shop
7943214 beijing 2008 t shirts at the airport and a couple of decks of playing cards that feature pictures of the ancient city
7943215 especially the t shirts i mean theyll never know that i didnt get these at the olympic village
7943216 i figure theyre kids so theyre probably not concerned with the wrapping of the gifts
7943217 after all with gift giving its really the thought that counts right
7943218 but i dont really know them that well so if my wife says wrapping paper is important ill just have to go buy some

7943224 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
7943225 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
7943226 the opening is to talk at any opportunity not to wait three weeks to have a meeting obviously that indicates a fundamental difference between the government and the opposition parties
7943227 well have to judge whether its appropriate to ask people to vote twice in the space of a few weeks

7943369 theyre supposed to put the chickens in cones to bleed out
7943370 these youngsters were just taking them after shechting and putting them in garbage bags

7943372 some of them are still alive theres blood everywhere its the most unhygienic thing ive ever seen

7943386 to see how things play out in the coming weeks
7943387 the us is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the dprk north korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq

7943472 while these bears are swimming around in an ice free coastal arctic ocean the only thing the state of alaska is doing is suing the federal government trying to overturn the listing of polar bears

7943499 i didnt love america unitl i was deprived of her
7943500 the other challenge obama faces is wildly unpopular michigan democrats according to time michigans democratic gov jennifer granholm has an approval rating of only 20 percent meanwhile superdelegate and detroits embattled democratic mayor kwame kilpatrick faces 10 felonies in two separate cases kilpatricks bond conditions and an electronic tether make it unlikely hell be able to attend this weeks democratic national convention
7943501 are we once again being programmed and conditioned to accept another corrupted voting tabulation in november computers are easy to tamper with this has already been a problem in several states has anyone else wondered about the polls does anyone smell a rat
7943502 gee in these tough times do you think it is wise for obama to raise taxes
7943503 mc cain and his pow history is like a guy who played foothall in highschool a is stilling trying to fit into his small jersey that doesnt fit anymore
7943504 we may be making more of the puma stuff than we should be
7943505 the good news for clinton the expectations are very low in this sense no one expects her to be able to pull this off convincingly
7943506 as for the attempts to contrast with mccain the gop campaign and other strategists weve communicated with believe mccain went a lot more unscathed than say obama will be after night one of the republican convention
7943507 of course only c span viewers may have received the full impact of those diatribes
7943508 wait we have aproblem here were supposed to keep the clinton obama narrative going and you say there is no narrative how can we do our jobs

7943510 viewers were treated to a taste of some anti mccain speeches of course only c span viewers may have received the full impact of those diatribes
7943511 senator edward m kennedy struggling with brain cancer arrived on monday night at the democratic national convention in a triumphant appearance that evoked 50 years of party history as democrats gathered to nominate senator barack obama for president mr kennedys appearance wiped away at least for the evening some of the tension that continued to plague the party in the wake of the primary fight between mr obama and senator hillary rodham clinton it also represented an effort by the obama campaign to claim the kennedy mantle and it set the stage for the second part of what was designed to be an emotionally powerful two act evening an appearance later by michelle obama who began a weeklong effort to present her husband and his entire family as embodiments of the american dream
7943512 michelle obama whose husband calls her the star of their family introduced herself monday to the democratic convention in a heartfelt speech invoking the dreams of her father and the hopes of her husband for the nation barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do obama said you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7943513 for all of the upbeat talk tensions continued to stir between supporters of the illinois senator and hillary rodham clinton threatening the unity that democrats desperately seek as they face a rugged fight against republican john mccain none of that friction was visible however during the official program beamed worldwide from the star spangled inside of denvers pepsi center sports arena the agenda was clear and two pronged build an image of obama as an everyman and start ripping mccain apart
7943514 but kennedys speech was much more than a moving acknowledgment of the tribute being paid to him it was much more than anyone could have expected it was in fact the partys real keynote address a call to arms that brought together past and present and set the agenda for all the speeches to follow he also and perhaps most importantly bequeathed the dream of charismatic liberalism that was embodied by president kennedy to barack obama with the martyred presidents daughter at his side he made it clear that obama more than any member of the kennedy family would be the future custodian of the camelot legacy
7943515 but what about puma can you really achieve unity arent half your constituency bitter

7943520 police in riot gear clashed last night with about 300 protesters about a mile from the site of the democratic national convention and some of the demonstrators were hit with pepper spray
7943521 federal authorities are looking into reports that a man arrested with rifles ammunition and drugs in his truck may have made threats against barack obama officials said yesterday
7943522 more details emerging from denver as we write this in the predawn hours on the now suspected plot to assassinate democratic presidential nominee barack obama with a high powered rifle on national television during his outdoor acceptance speech at invesco field thursday night

7943524 police in riot gear clashed last night with about 300 protesters about a mile from the site of the democratic national convention and some of the demonstrators were hit with pepper spray
7943525 i wont vote for obama because i am bitter that the media treated her bad and they were sexist
7943526 this is an appropriate time to use these rainy day funds given the unprecedented financial storm pounding metro today
7943527 you know could i just mention to you jay and a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell without i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair and i spent those five and a half years because not because i wanted to get a house when i got out and you know im very proud of cindys father he was a guy that barely got out of high school fought in world war ii in the army air corps came home and made a business and made the american dream
7943528 mccain built up the suspense by withholding the guests name at first but then gave it away saying one of his most famous songs i know youre very familiar with gasolina drawing gasps of surprise from the crowd and then finally said well here he is daddy yankee though mccain has sometimes shown surprising familiarity with rap stars and pop culture references because of the musical tastes of his daughters it is unlikely that the conservative republican would have made a point of mentioning the song had he known that the gasolina lyrics are loaded with sexual references although theres some debate about what the word gasolina means in this context one thing is certain its not a petroleum product
7943529 the best asset for the campaign i knew the least about
7943530 we tried every diplomatic aproach and now we are force to go to war
7943531 wait a second john mccain was in the saddlebrook church answering questions that were supposed to be pretty tough without hesitations but hes stumped by something so basic as how many houses do you own what gives
7943532 when i was younger i didnt have a house or a chair or a table and i had to walk to school uphill both ways in the snow and the rain pulling a cart five miles to the old one room schoolhouse
7943533 i grew up a pampered princess who became an adulteress then served as arm candy for a man 19 years older than i am and ive never done an honest days work in my life
7943534 well you know i was in a pow camp for 5 1 2 years and i couldnt think about the economy that is why i am so ill equipped to handle it
7943535 i spent 5 1 2 years in a hole in nam and all i have to show for it is this lousy nomination
7943536 the big question of the presidential election says l douglas wilder the nations first elected black governor is not whether america is ready for a black president rather he asks are the clintons ready
7943537 instead in interviews with delegates and aides to the rival camps it was clear monday that tensions have only swelled since the heat of a primary competition fraught with racial gender and generational differences obama backers are frustrated that the clintons do not seem willing to let go of their 16 year dominance of the democratic party while clinton aides complained privately that the young presumed nominee is not paying them proper respect a tension heightened by the revelation that obama never seriously considered his rival as a running mate
7943538 in a private meeting with sen barack obama after she conceded the race for the democratic presidential nomination sen hillary rodham clinton made a request that he consider her for his vice presidential running mate but not put her through the charade of being vetted if he was not serious obama told clinton then it was unlikely he would choose her people familiar with the conversation said obama did not want to lead her on and after campaigning against her for more than a year already had a sense that their pairing would not be the right fit
7943539 as one political dynasty was celebrating its legacy and ceding the political stage on monday night the other dominant family of the democratic party was struggling to protect its legacy and accept its own exit from the spotlight senator hillary rodham clinton and bill clinton had once hoped this convention would be theirs an exultation of past and future clinton white houses instead they were coming face to face with shrunken supporting roles
7943540 hillary clinton will be damned if she looks too methodically perfect too much the purveyor of practiced routine and not enough the cheery personification of enthusiasm shell also be damned if shes too exuberant too obviously raising her voice in unbridled exhortation for the team she will either be deemed too cool or all too cagily warm
7943541 i think senator clinton can be competitive across the country but i think one of the things we as a party are going to have to do is look at the ideas on how we get the country back on the right track we need to not simply look at the personality but look at the ideas but i find all across the country there is a real sense that what we as democrats have to do is not simply be competitive in 16 or 17 states but actually have candidates that can win all across the country
7943542 we prefer to use steel bars set in reinforced concrete
7943543 i wont vote for obama because i am bitter that the media treated her bad and they were sexist
7943544 the clintons do not seem willing to let go of their 16 year dominance of the democratic party while clinton aides complained privately that the young presumed nominee is not paying them proper respect a tension heightened by the revelation that obama never seriously considered his rival as a running mate
7943545 she hit all the right notes dems have catharsis amp unity clinton so gracious
7943546 i think hillary did alot to help obama already and i think she can get most of her supporters to support obama

7943558 having something like this in the house especially when there are kids all over the place is a bad idea i found one gun in the house when he was living with me but this gun i didnt know about because he lives separately now otherwise i would have cut this gun to pieces as well

7943561 the message is clear we in permatang pauh and in malaysia we demand change for freedom and justice
7943562 we want an independent judiciary we want the economy to benefit the vast majority not the corrupt few
7943563 i think he feels he has to ride the momentum and given what he has experienced over the past few weeks he will be more convinced than ever that he has to do that
7943564 i would at least say that he has a vision of what the future economy should look like he has a roadmap
7943565 given the paucity of ideas in bn anwar comes across as an appealing leader with the experience to boot

7943580 she learned the role very quickly she does it well and i think shes effective there i would not like to see her leave that
7943581 i dont want to see him become mayor i worked with him in the assembly for a couple years and its not a comfortable experience
7943582 hes not a team player its his way or the highway and he talks sometimes more than he listens nice guy good friend but im not supporting him for mayor
7943583 as far as the yuppies go i think theyre going to cancel each other out
7943584 hes got one or two issues he focuses on but what matters to the real people who are paying the rent and mortgages hes not tuned into

7943586 we are prepared to make the necessary changes to regain public confidence in the bn
7943587 its still too early to state the factors for our loss

7943592 i dont want to discuss the evidence at this point outside of the courtroom
7943593 one of the chief reasons for the great variation in case fatality in different groups is undoubtedly the nature and relative abundance of secondary invaders the excessively high mortality in certain army camps on certain transports and in particular hospitals or barracks seems most readily explicable in this way
7943594 1 the influenza virus weakens the resistant power of the pulmonary tissues so that various bacteria are able to play the role of secondary invaders 2 the precise nature of the secondary and tertiary invaders is largely a matter of accident dependent on the occurrence of particular bacteria in the respiratory tract of persons at the time of infection and in the case of group outbreaks on their occurrence in contacts 3 the character of the resulting pneumonia clinical and pathologic is largely determined by the nature of the secondary invaders whether pfeiffer bacillus streptococcus pneumococcus or other organisms 4 there seems little doubt that the influenza virus besides depressing the general pulmonary resistance also acts directly on the pulmonary tissues causing capillary necrosis edema and hemorrhage 5 it seems to be true therefore that the fatal outcome of influenza pneumonia is determined partly by the degree to which the influenza virus depresses local and general pulmonary resistance and partly by the virulence and nature of the bacteria which invade the tissues in the wake of the specific virus
7943595 john mccain says he loves this country and i take him at his word but even if he didnt have bushs boys running his campaign its his bad and reckless judgments that have cost our country dearly cost us all really youve had your chance and look what you and bush have done record foreclosures an economy in shambles wages falling bad judgments that had placed america alone in the world weaker thousands dead in iraq bin laden free and an afghan war mccain ignored on the brink were on the wrong track and mccain helped put us there it is his bad judgment supporting bush 100 along the way that has hurt us all but we can change that thanks john but well take it from here

7943610 the psychology of sales call reluctance earning what youre worth in sales
7943611 being able to draw attention to your contributions and competencies at work has become an important part of modern career management and it is something most women are still unwilling or unable to do as consistently as their male counterparts
7943612 actually prefer male managers to female managers claiming men are more consistent and fair minded than women

7943615 recently a hiring manager wrote to me with a very interesting observation the manager said i am screening candidates right now for two regional positions and there is a strong distinction between men who come across so much more confident and eager they often have a planned strategy for their career where women dont youll notice she did not say the men were brighter or more qualified the difference was that they came to the table with confidence energy and a solid plan this is a good example of how women can undersell themselves or fail to market themselves effectively

7943672 son miserables que actuaron de esta manera por el solo hecho de que pensaban distinto a ellos
7943673 se golpeaban el pecho en la iglesia y luego picaneaban en las c rceles

7943682 if gustav is able to thread the needle passing through the yucatan channel into the gulf of mexico it could intensify to category 4 or 5 strength over the warm water in the gulf
7943683 the hurricane is very dangerous we ask people to take it very seriously
7943684 we are asking people living near the sea or near rivers to immediately leave those places and look for safer places

7943687 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
7943688 it is a violation of their commitments to the six party framework it certainly is in violation of the principle of action for action
7943689 video persecusi n a miley cyrus y emily osment shopping
7943690 so far weve seen a series of unfortunate decisions by the russians that only serve to further isolate them and we hope that they hear the loud voices from the international community and understand that its not in their long term interests to take these kinds of actions
7943691 i can assure you that these are purely humanitarian aid shipments that are going into georgia and nothing else
7943692 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7943693 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no

7943700 todo depende de la posici n de nuestros aliados de la comunidad mundial y de nuestros aliados en occidente
7943701 ridiculous just on reading them and we cant be asked to believe that they respond to a work scheme
7943702 it was clear that his priority was electoral favouritism rather than to reduce the enormous deficit
7943703 town planning and treasury the departments that could occasion most work have not been delegated i e responsibility given to another councillor and the mayor himself takes on those tasks we know how he is doing
7943704 jimenas nasa if it needs two councillors plus the mayors supervision
7943705 it is also curious that while jes s rodr guez is assigned popular festivities new councillor juan jos rond n is in charge of musical shows when both of these require signing contracts that neither of them can sign this on top of the demise of the generic department of culture which thus falls into the mayors hands once again he was the councillor for culture in the previous government thus we have another department with three councillors assigned to such an important area while town planning and treasury are left empty
7943706 other ghost departments are those of libraries of which jimena is singularly lacking after years of false promises the municipal tourist office new technologies local media and another series of such
7943707 a poster child for everything that is wrong with the building monitoring system concerning low level violations the lack of solid fencing at construction sites in communities like williamsburg which have them on every block represents a nasty breakdown of the system
7943708 georgia has asked world leaders for the countrys speedy integration into nato and the european union
7943709 we will continue our struggle to develop and unite georgia
7943710 our country will not be alone in this drive and we will have the support of all progressive international community
7943711 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
7943712 this is not an easy decision but it is the only way to protect peoples lives
7943713 we are not going to talk to the puppets we want to talk to the puppeteer that is moscow
7943714 we need the territories not the leaders or their population
7943715 we will continue to stand behind georgias democracy we will continue to insist that georgias sovereignty and independence and territorial integrity be respected
7943716 there are no doubts that the mikheil saakashvili regime is absolutely out of step with the high standards established by the international community
7943717 russia which has genuine friendly sentiments and affection for the georgian people is convinced that sooner or later it will find deserved leaders capable of really caring about their country and who develop mutually respectful equal good relations with all caucasus nations russia will contribute to that in every possible way
7943718 in both cases the center started a war in kosovo and south ossetia as well as abkhazia but the conflicts were halted in different ways through the ruthless inhuman bombardment of belgrade in the case of kosovo and without punishing tbilisi for its attacks on sukhumi abkhazias capital
7943719 a ceasefire was agreed peacekeepers were deployed and mechanisms for talks established belgrade has never tried to use military force or cast doubt on negotiations since 1999 but they were destroyed by kosovo albanians supported by the west and it was tbilisi that undermined the settlement mechanisms in south ossetia and abkhazia
7943720 therefore drawing parallels is irrelevant here and the difference is evident between belgrades policy towards kosovo and how saakashvilis regime behaved towards south ossetia and abkhazia
7943721 so i never heather you know that was the first thing i thought of
7943722 wir haben absolute geduld wir sind berzeugt dass wir mit j rgen klinsmann den richtigen mann haben und dass wir auch den richtigen weg gehen
7943723 ich hoffe dass wir herbstmeister werden das ist nach wir vor unser ziel
7943724 ich bin optimistisch dass wir jetzt auch die stabilit t reinkriegen die wir brauchen mit der r ckkehr eines martin demichelis
7943725 wir haben auch im letzten jahr zehn mal unentschieden gespielt und am ende des jahres wurde mit zehn punkten vorsprung die deutsche meisterschaft gewonnen
7943726 dass was wir letztes jahr gemacht haben ist nicht jedes jahr m glich
7943727 van bommel ist ein unbeherrschter charakter der sich nicht im griff hat und damit sich und der mannschaft keinen gefallen tut
7943728 das gibt es nicht dass ein mann wie er der torj ger war der kopfballstark ist und links wie rechts schie t keinen mehr rein bringt
7943729 imagination was given to man to compensate him for what he is not a sense of humor to console him for what he is
7943730 if the world were merely seductive that would be easy if it were merely challenging that would be no problem but i arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world this makes it hard to plan the day

7943737 i have had family and friends who have had cancer and some have not survived its a way of doing something to help
7943738 decided to compromise by giving hyatt a chance to fulfill their commitments by managing this serving of alcohol in a secluded restaurant on the 40th floor so he would keep his hotel with the family atmosphere he would like to present to his guests
7943739 wouldnt give you the impact on the alcohol ban that much as if you were in the winter season which features businesspeople and international tourists
7943740 hopefully we can get the park in good condition provided we dont get too much rain
7943741 i suppose the second round has definitely been more difficult
7943742 its an excellent result for us but were going to have to continue to improve if were going to win the fox memorial
7943743 it was really an adventure and a good opportunity to do a bit of work over there
7943744 there is still an area which is a no go area for police because it is too dangerous
7943745 the government doesnt have the ability or integrity to handle millions of dollars
7943746 new zealand had formed a programme called community auxiliary police which we were overseeing
7943747 their life revolves around existence and when they are not trying to exist they are relaxing
7943748 contact doesnt see any significant upside in the 2009 financial year
7943749 so with a lack of growth the shares look fully priced around current levels
7943750 that would be a valuable contribution to the south island in the next month to six weeks as the coldest part of the winter rolls out
7943751 the democrats energy record is one of empty rhetoric and broken promises
7943752 the democrats energy record is one of empty rhetoric and broken promises and thats why they have no credibility with the american people
7943753 house republicans are offering an all of the above strategy to lower gasoline prices by increasing production of american energy promoting more conservation and efficiency and encouraging the use of more alternative and renewable fuels the american people support our plan and they have every right to demand that speaker pelosi allow a vote on our energy reforms they deserve more than yet another democratic scheme that will do nothing to lower gasoline prices or reduce home heating costs house republicans unprecedented nationwide gas prices protest entered its fourth full week yesterday and we will not relent until we secure a vote on our all of the above energy reforms on behalf of working families and small businesses who need our help
7943754 between the three of them thats a lot of experience gone
7943755 the young girls really stepped up when they needed to

7943757 you really have to play at the top of your game every week and we didnt play our best game
7943758 the last few weeks weve been playing above what were capable of
7943759 youd probably do it in a couple of catchments to see if the model will work
7943760 in most of canterbury the issue is mainly about allocation but not quality so you may not be able to use the whole of the model there might be places where nutrient concerns as well as quantity could be used
7943761 obviously with the number of takes you have got in canterbury you probably are a reasonable place to start and see if this model could work if the government could help provide metering set up the registry
7943762 indications are that for example a national registry might be 30m to put in place thats a one off cost
7943763 for an era when our supply of water was vastly greater than our needs
7943764 it would be safe to say that im leaning toward that

7943772 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7943773 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get our country back on the right path

7943817 was defined as a percentage of listings on a site that matched the mls
7943818 this study is important because it shows that many people looking for their dream home have had much of their time wasted on having to search through screen after screen of bad data it really is a case of buyer beware
7943819 we were careful to tease apart the data to be sure we were making an apples to apples comparison of the listings in these markets
7943820 the data here clearly show as they did in a national study we conducted earlier this year that a site based on information from a local mls will give consumers a more accurate picture of whats available in a local market

7943915 im certainly not hinting or speculating about a converged device im wondering if there are any opportunities for us to improve the experience for people who use both devices for example viewing your zune social network in internet explorer mobile converting a zune playlist into wma ringtones or converting zunes artwork to windows mobile themes
7943916 windows mobile needs to be the platform and make zune the ecosystem that runs on that platform make zune the centerpiece for its core uses music video photos podcasts and deprecate the wmp as just a general media player
7943917 the zune should be able to partner with a bluetooth phone to fetch music from elsewhere and or the phone ought to be able to push files from the windows media player library to the zune
7943918 i have a zune and a windows mobile phone and i need to use windows media player sync center windows mobile device center zune software and have outlook open all to sync my two devices five different programs this is insane

7943955 a defeat like this can be demoralising but weve come back from this before credit to england but we didnt apply ourselves as we should have done

7944045 a significant shift in the way people are watching music film
7944046 its just one person with a guitar and a couple people banging on parking signs or whatever to try to make a song

7944114 mereka jelas melanggar undang undang nomor 5 tahun 1990 tentang konservasi sumber daya alam hayati dan ekosistemnya
7944115 jadi tidak cukup tekanan bagi tni untuk membuat mereka kembali memilih masuk ke dalam kehidupan politik dan sipil tidak seperti pada tahun 1965 1966 atau tahun 1997 1998 militer belum akan menemukan titik masuk entry point yang pas untuk mengambil alih lagi semoga titik masuk itu tidak perlu ada

7944121 yang jelas anggota kpid harus betul betul paham dengan dampak siaran terhadap masyarakat kalau tidak ia tidak akan tahu apa kerjanya nanti
7944122 saya memang anggota dpr tetapi saya tidak paham hukum setahu saya dahulu saya disebut tertangkap tangan tetapi ternyata saya disebutkan melakukan beberapa tindakan pidana pula
7944123 pemprov sumut sudah mengirimkan rancangan peraturan daerah sebagai tindak lanjut pp no 41 2007 sekarang rancangan peraturan daerah tersebut masih dalam pembahasan di dprd

7944248 it puts russia of course in opposition to a number of security council resolutions to which it is party most appallingly as a member of the p 5
7944249 we obviously cant allow what russias done to go without there being some consequences
7944250 it simply means that the russian president continues not to honor the commitments that the russians have signed on to
7944251 while there have been some significant russian movements they are not yet living up to the terms of the cease fire agreement

7944254 over the previous 10 months monthly fatalities declined an average of 4
7944255 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7944256 sivak predicts that highway deaths this year will drop below 37 000 for the first time since 1961 if the march and april trends continue the government motor vehicle death count for 1961 totaled 36 285 the number of highway deaths peaked in 1972 at 55 600 then generally declined over the next two decades for the past several years the number has hovered above 42 000 a year

7944260 russia is never after a new sanctions resolution we hope constant contacts between iran and the iaea the u n nuclear agency will lead to a realistic solution guaranteeing that iran is not after nuclear weapons technology
7944261 syrias bad negotiating position with israel is leading it to look for more weapons and to try to grow more teeth before returning to the table with israel

7944265 many so called revelations about sir salmans home life his relationship with his wife son and interactions with police protection officers
7944266 in addition to the invasion of his privacy which this book represented of particular concern to the claimant were a series of utterly and demonstrably false statements which it contained
7944267 allegations of this nature are of course highly defamatory and they were particularly offensive to the claimant because they are simply not true
7944268 in fact as a number of his protection officers volunteered to testify in the event that this matter came to trial sir salman conducted himself with dignity and courtesy throughout a time of great personal danger and concern

7944276 we want cme to be unbiased and science driven and we dont want it to be influenced by marketing we want our educational activities for whomever we are serving whether its our own faculty or our colleagues in the community locally or globally to be true to the science and the evidence and not be influenced by any kind of financial industry support
7944277 bias either by appearance or reality has become woven into the very fabric of continuing education
7944278 under the present system in many circumstances a cme course will be held only if a commercial company is willing to sponsor it
7944279 while for profit enterprises may occasionally engage in philanthropy it should not be surprising that the core motivation of pharmaceutical and medical device industries in supporting cme is to market their products and services
7944280 this leads to a cme curriculum which is at least in part designed to address market needs rather than being entirely focused upon improving performance of practicing physicians
7944281 clearly it would be preferable for stanford faculty to design our cme curriculum solely based upon the needs of our learners as they seek to address the health care needs of their patients
7944282 we all agreed it is inappropriate for industry to influence content
7944283 if industry really wants to enhance the education of clinicians they should be given the opportunity to do so
7944284 but we wanted to create a situation in which they had no effect on the choice of topics or their content so were happy to have industry support as long as it is provided without strings or expectations about the course content
7944285 really brings control of cme curricula back to academic medical centers
7944286 one of my hopes is to make stanford a destination so we can hold cme programs here leveraging the wonderful cultural attractions on campus
7944287 i think right now industry is under a lot of pressure in its use of marketing for education theyre re examining their role in cme as well
7944288 as we take this step my hope is that other institutions will start to follow suit i think the climate will change dramatically to enforce that if institutions do not take greater responsibility there is going to be a mandate whether its one that we initiate or one that is imposed that frees up these intertwined interactions of academia and industry around medical education
7944289 this vote means that malaysians want a change we are entering parliament with a clear agenda it is time that you behave and accept the stark realities of the day
7944290 i think very significantly the importance of the victory is in the campaign message itself
7944291 i think it is evident in this campaign that anwar has carried a truly non sectarian and non communal message to the people and i think this is something very very important for all our people especially proponents of non sectarian politics in this county

7944371 they have sophisticated technology surely they can distinguish between the taliban and the people
7944372 now the people are beginning to think that the isaf are deliberately targeting civilians their perception is that the isaf forces are committing abuses and this is driving people more towards the anti government forces
7944373 and isaf should also coordinate with the government in every military action they are taking and they should also work closely with the civilians and try to regain our trust and then they can succeed
7944374 the biggest need is for the foreign troops to educate themselves more about afghan culture the night raids in particular are really bad they are going into peoples houses and taking people and this is not right when the people are taken they are not really taliban or anti government people they are innocent and the foreign troops realize this and so they give the civilians to government officials but the government is really corrupt and they will not release the people so once they are put in prison they will be there for a long time if they are not rich people they cannot bribe officials to get out

7944440 we have the word of barack obama and the word of other party leaders that the new hampshire primary is safe
7944441 i dont want to read in the paper that one of our delegates think theres a 50 50 chance of us protecting the primary
7944442 i think if his info is obama has guaranteed the primary is safe thats great
7944443 i should have known that people would ask questions about it
7944444 i think the more people that understands our rich history in the primary the better chance we have in protecting it
7944445 america should be a place where you can make it

7944450 doctor who is like that as well and because of the nature of how doctor who evolves you become part of that tradition rather than a re handling of it

7944513 say give me one reason why we didnt spend the rest of saturday together
7944514 is a models individual weather correlated to the weather in the real world given the assumptions of the model and no input of actual weather data
7944515 is it not possible that a large portion of the current warming trend is a product of internal climate variability
7944516 how it is you decide that ghgs are responsible for a deterministic forced trend
7944517 why is the itcz at other latitudes generally displaced northward
7944518 with the greatest warming in the tropics generally being in the mid to upper troposphere does that mean the level of non divergence in the hadley cell will rise
7944519 in summary our results imply that the first step in a time series long correlation study should be the separation of the deterministic components from the stochastic ones otherwise wrong conclusions concerning possible memory effects may be drawn
7944520 rescaled range analysis is one of the classical methods used for detecting and quantifying long term dependence in time series
7944521 the ipcc report for instance is very clear in stating that the detection and attribution of climate changes is only clearly possible at continental scales and above
7944522 by correlating at the annual and other short term periods they are effectively comparing the weather in the real world with that in a model
7944523 furthermore by using only one to four grid boxes for their comparisons even the longer term 30 year forced trends are not going to come out of the noise
7944524 seasonal cycle shifts in hydroclimatology over the western united states
7944525 a fundamental and societally relevant conclusion from these studies is that the use of the ipcc model predictions as a basis for policy making is
7944526 the patagonian region neuqu n r o negro la pampa chubut santa cruz and tierra del fuego provinces temperature increase more frequent intense precipitations fluvial valley floods glacier diminution floods wood biomass fires desertification coastal erosion
7944527 for preparing climate change scenarios for argentina the global model hadcm3 uk on ipcc scenarios has been utilized a remarkable trend to decrease of precipitation is also observed for the central region of chile and the argentinean region of cuyo province of neuqu n and the western part of r o negro and chubut these scenarios indicate a continuity of the climatic trends observed during the last decades
7944528 in this study we investigate the weekly to monthly predictability of clouds and precipitation over the lsa east defined roughly by 33 430n latitude and 78 890w longitude
7944529 those irregularities affect weather which over the 30 years of the test becomes climate
7944530 although if i took the time i might be able to justify that view based on some physical arguments maybe
7944531 but dont you think there are some underlying patterns in the global climate that can be understood even with greatly simplified models the hadley cells for example
7944532 lsa east defined roughly by 33 43 degrees n latitude and 78 89 degrees w longitude
7944533 the issue is not developing an understanding it is testing a model the greatly simplified or somewhat simplified models cannot be tested because they do not faithfully simulate particular locations that can be compared to the same real world locations
7944534 42 kevinm im not sure thats a good analogy of what is being compared
7944535 however the earth is not a kettle and albany is not an indistinguishable location it has specific climate characteristics and weather patterns which can be simulated in climate models also the albany discrepancies are repeated for 7 more locations worldwide but is that enough locations to say the model is poor i dont know
7944536 so no number of locations would be enough because ks et al s research question is inapplicable in the first place
7944537 proving a negative is one of the top and common logic fallacies the default is that the cause does not exist until it is proven otherwise
7944538 so no number of locations would be enough because ks et al s research question is inapplicable in the first place
7944539 the number of heads coming up in a run of a particular length
7944540 in a climate model there is a lot of sensitivity to initial conditions and which particular small fluctuations occur in any particular run
7944541 lynn 77 i respect your zeal but asserting things that are prima facie contraindicated in support of your cause is not a good way to build your credibility viz a viz people you may be trying to convince at least in a logical and scientific environment
7944542 if every point in a model is inaccurate how would any aggregate statistic from the model have any validity
7944543 actually you are more interested in the behavior that persists across various initial conditions and in spite of fluctuations you are also interested in the range of behaviors the results of any single run are not that interesting thats why the paper is so baffling
7944544 a total of 1144 data records exist from the three data sources for the region west of the continental divide and south of 54 n of these 824 snow records have 1 april records spanning the time period 1950 97 and are used in most of the analysis for the temporal analysis a larger subset of the 1144 snow courses was used
7944545 data from the nearest five stations are combined into reference time series there is a total of 394 stations with good precipitation data and 443 with good temperature data
7944546 the credibility of the geographically distributed representation of climate by gcms
7944547 with 50 of the electricity coming from coal and with climate change legislation being enacted calling for targets and timetables and so on how do we continue to use our coal resource
7944548 their approach makes no sense unless you want to use gcms for long term weather prediction
7944549 contrariwise if it was so it might be and if it were so it would be but as it isnt it aint thats logic
7944550 take enough runs and you will elucidate the physics of the system
7944551 if you shut your yap and thought maybe youd learn something
7944552 sweep this issue of weather vs climate under the rug
7944553 it is helpful to distinguish forcings that are important in the global mean from those which might be important locally but not have much impact for global warming
7944554 estimating the hurst parameter from observed data is very tricky business
7944555 climate the average of weather over at least a 30 year period note that the climate taken over different periods of time 30 years 1000 years may be different the old saying is climate is what we expect and weather is what we get
7944556 climate change a non random change in climate that is measured over several decades or longer the change may be due to natural or human induced causes
7944557 because global warming isnt just hidden in shorter term weather noise it may have an effect on that weather noise
7944558 its the average of the shape of the distribution of the variations of the shape of the distribution of every variable
7944559 one could comb the universe for similar planets to get more data like an ensemble of model runs
7944560 weve said over and again that short term weather events are difficult to impossible to attribute to climate change
7944561 here was katrina this is what may happen more as the climate warms
7944562 short term weather events are difficult to impossible to attribute to climate change
7944563 social facts not psychological or individual level facts cause social facts
7944564 my plants came up early my pond froze a month late cherry blossoms bloomed a few weeks early
7944565 why doesnt it just keep getting hotter and hotter yadda yadda year s were actually cooler than yadda yadda
7944566 this is real climate and that realisation is not an earthly climate
7944567 was the particular realisation that is the history of the earths climate likely
7944568 how well do the gcms perform at generating suitably high hurst coefficients
7944569 die relativierung der relativit tstheorie l sst mich das mathematische verstehen

7944571 it was a really good setup it actually took us a while to find the trapdoor that led down to the basement where he was performing the grow
7944572 i asked him for his drivers license i know hes the vice president and all but i still had to check the residence he probably has several
7944573 if you wouldnt mind we have a third member for your twosome hes in a hurry and hates to play alone so he asks if he can join you
7944574 hey anyone ever tell you that you look just like darth i mean dick cheney
7944575 yes my wife has mentioned that to me numerous times
7944576 im in town to cast an absentee ballot for tuesdays primary but i cant be here then
7944577 what if i hit a helicopter or secret service guy
7944578 do i get a drop or do i have to play it where it lands
7944579 call me dick and im sure it will work out
7944580 well at least we dont have money on the round
7944581 you cant miss it its the one with the flag pole and american flag flying i dont get to spend much time here though
7944582 my wife did the interior when we get to 18 would you like to see it
7944583 you cant seriously think you can carry the water even tiger woods would lay up this shot
7944584 if i play that shot where it landed youll never see me again
7944585 we are really excited to be back at tour of ireland this time with the new team type 1 squad
7944586 kobzarenko and aldape both had strong showings in ireland last year and i think the new race format will favor guys like glen chadwick and matt wilson
7944587 the team is in good form right now so we will be trying for a good gc spot and we are always in the hunt for stage victories
7944588 the tour of ireland is a top shelf event offering some of the best in european cycling

7944591 it seems unavoidable and as a matter of fact certain conditions of sharia are already recognised in our society
7944592 this is because small scale fisheries employ more than 12 million people world wide compared to half a million in the industrial sector
7944593 and because small scale fisheries use less fuel to catch fish
7944594 small scale fisheries use fishing gear that are more selective and far less destructive to deep sea environments
7944595 as a result they discard very little unwanted fish and almost all of their catch is used for human consumption
7944596 for the amount of resources invested we havent seen significant decrease in demand for species for which the global stocks are on the edge of collapse
7944597 market based initiatives while well intentioned unduly discriminate against small scale fishers for their lack of resources to provide data for certification
7944598 its an unfair disadvantage that in any other industry would have had people up in arms
7944599 but small scale fishers are often in developing countries and have very little political influence
7944600 this program dramatically simplifies the process of developing and launching effective marketing campaigns allowing integras dealers to focus on what they do best sell and install home entertainment systems
7944601 the revenew systems program will help our dealers create effective marketing campaigns with consistent messaging and branding it simplifies and accelerates campaign execution while giving us specific feedback about which types of campaigns are most effective

7944605 we find that the cost of capturing co2 with the complete system would fall between 80 and 250 t co2 and improvements are suggested which reduce the upper bound cost to 130 t co2 even at the high calculated cost air capture has implications for climate policy however dedicated engineering and technological innovation have potential to produce much lower cost systems
7944606 new technology that i do not understand will save us
7944607 as noted the models do not consider the possibility of an equilibration of the climate with a steady increase in aerosol as would actually occur thus the modeling is deficient in addressing this important reality
7944608 with interest i follow when capturing co2 from the air will be the lowest cost system
7944609 does this mean you support a carbon tax of up to 250 ton co2 to pay for it
7944610 there is no hard evidence that aerosol geoengineering would a result in dangerous reductions in stratospheric ozone or b lead to harmful acid precipitation
7944611 there is no linear predictability in terms of how ecosystems respond the phenomena of collapse is one that we have under appreciated partly because of the feed back mechanisms that we are still trying to understand
7944612 leemans and eickhout 2004 found that adaptive capacity decreases rapidly with an increasing rate of climate change their study finds that five percent of all ecosystems cannot adapt more quickly than 0 1 c per decade over time forests will be among the ecosystems to experience problems first because their ability to migrate to stay within the climate zone they are adapted to is limited if the rate is 0 3 c per decade 15 percent of ecosystems will not be able to adapt if the rate should exceed 0 4 c per decade all ecosystems will be quickly destroyed opportunistic species will dominate and the breakdown of biological material will lead to even greater emissions of co2 this will in turn increase the rate of warming
7944613 another reason for concern regional and global impacts on ecosystems for different levels of climate change
7944614 few seem to realise that the present ipcc models predict almost unanimously that by 2040 the average summer in europe will be as hot as the summer of 2003 when over 30 000 died from heat by then we may cool ourselves with air conditioning and learn to live in a climate no worse than that of baghdad now but without extensive irrigation the plants will die and both farming and natural ecosystems will be replaced by scrub and desert what will there be to eat the same dire changes will affect the rest of the world and i can envisage americans migrating into canada and the chinese into siberia but there may be little food for any of them
7944615 peak temperatures may rise twice as fast as average temperatures as climate change hots up
7944616 again i refer to the total abstention from other future possibilities although all the concerns deal with possible futures please see again goettmann fr d ric arne thomas and markus antonietti 2007 metal free activation of co2 by mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride angewandte chemie vol 46 no 15 pp 2717 2720 april 2 2007 if needed the future solution is e g this artificial photosynthesis besides nature and man gets the extra biomass urgently needed the main message is that human ingenuity will resolve this co2 problem if it exists at all
7944617 a much discussed idea to offset global warming by injecting sulfate particles into the stratosphere would have a drastic impact on earths protective ozone layer new research concludes the study led by simone tilmes of the national center for atmospheric research ncar in boulder colo warns that such an approach would delay the recovery of the antarctic ozone hole by decades and cause significant ozone loss over the arctic
7944618 the economics of geoengineering are there is no better word for it incredible according to teller et al 2003 5 engineered particles would be even cheaper mainly because of the reduced volume of material that would need to be put into the stratosphere they estimate that the sunlight scattering needed to offset the warming effect of rising greenhouse gas concentrations by the year 2100 would cost just 1 billion per year
7944619 the greens resistance to geo engineering sits very uncomfortably with its message that the planet is screwed and were all going to die it suggests that they dont actually believe their own press releases and that they know the situation is not as dire as they would like the rest of us to think it is it suggests that environmentalists regard science and engineering as the cause of problems and not the solution
7944620 i hope i never need a parachute but if my plane is going down in flames i sure hope i have a parachute handy
7944621 i hope well never need geoengineering schemes but if a climate catastrophe occurs i sure hope we will have thought through our options carefully
7944622 methadone is a pretty good metaphor kind of like saccharine sugarless sodas and decaf coffee not really facing the problem
7944623 we all know that we have to convert all coal fired power plants to nuclear worldwide by 2015 but it wont happen because the average american has an irrational fear of all things nuclear
7944624 measurements from space since the 1970s give a global annual earth albedo of 0 29 the average incident solar radiative flux is 341 w m 2 so that a change in albedo of 0 01 represents a global energy balance change of 3 4 w m 2 similar in magnitude to the impact of doubling carbon dioxide in the atmosphere global albedo can change with changes in earths cloud fractional coverage cloud thickness aerosol amount forest cover or snow and ice cover for example a 2 year change in albedo was caused by the large mount pinatubo volcanic eruption in june 1991 stratospheric aerosols from the eruption increased global albedo by up to 0 007 because of the reflection of an additional 2 5 w m 2 of solar radiation over the following 2 years
7944625 its not the whole biosphere at risk here except for very human centric definitions of biosphere its mostly the charismatic megafauna that are in trouble if you include people as charismatic debatable yes
7944626 all we have to do to destroy the planets climate and its biota and leave a ruined world to our children and grandchildren is to just keep on where were going today just keep releasing greenhouse gases at current rates just keep degrading and homogenizing and destroying our biological resources just continue releasing toxic chemicals at current rates and by the latter part of this century the world wont be fit to live in

7944649 tears streaming down her face she is confronted by police a teenage girl apparently planning to blow herself up in front of an iraqi school the officers handcuffed her to a metal balustrade before moving in with extreme caution to uncover a vest full of explosives hidden under her colourful robe the dramatic scenes were captured on a video shot by the police the girl thought to be around 15 years old later said that she was given the bomb and told to wait outside the school for further instructions in the footage she denies trying to stage a suicide attack and appears dazed even drugged she gave her first name as rania and said she was born in 1993 her exchange with the police offered a rare glimpse at a teenager allegedly recruited by insurgents however it was not clear to what extent her answers were given out of fear of the police or even of her own family police in baqouba where the girl was caught on sunday said she was fitted with the vest by female relatives of her husband whom she married five months ago they also claimed that the girls father was a suicide bomber and her mother and one of her sisters were later arrested however u s sources said that the girl turned herself in after being hooked up to the explosives against her will the police footage begins with rania standing on the street her arms are already behind her back where they have apparently been tied by an officer in an attempt to restrain her a policeman is shown opening her robe and later frames show her wearing what appears to be a suicide vest containing about 33lb of explosives

7944657 a policeman assigned to guard the archangel michael church in deshasha beni soueif province south of cairo hit three women while they were taking sand into the church to fix the floor which was cracked as result of water collection underneath
7944658 the worrying rise in sectarian tension that we have seen in deshasha is a direct result of violations committed by the police
7944659 this incident must be investigated and those responsible held accountable
7944660 the archangel michael church in deshasha is but one example of the futility of any efforts to reform and unify construction and renovation laws for places of worship so long as security agents continue to violate existing laws in a discriminatory manner and with complete impunity

7944692 after acquiring the coffee equipment company in april 2008 we asked a small team of coffee buyers to find unique small lot coffees whose flavors are best highlighted using the clover brewing system
7944693 we committed to our customers that we would reinvent coffee and once they taste coffee brewed from the clover we know they will want to come back for more
7944694 we hope everyone will be inspired to learn about where these coffees come from and the rich story behind each selection

7944710 yes you havent been coming to get your oil and lube service when you should
7944711 you have to take care of your car so your car will take care of you
7944712 yes but i expect to see you back in 3 months
7944713 granted i was there with one of my favorite people lady k but the place is gorgeous
7944714 hi two chicken burritos for pick up please the first with no beans sauteed onions extra salsa and just a touch of sour cream the second
7944715 after reading countless reviews of this place i had to take my sushi loving booty here
7944716 so im supposed to be getting ready for the day and i promised my friend i would only write my review of the castro theatre but
7944717 if you are ever in the city call me and we will go out
7944718 you look around and expect a truck to veer off and plow into you at any moment its not bryant park youve got exhaust coming at you but its kind of cool
7944719 you hear so many accidents of the cars going out of control and all they have here is plastic pots
7944720 were going to roll the dice and eat lunch here today
7944721 its amazing how a few plants can make you feel removed from all that noise and traffic
7944722 the plaza is protected by parked cars in some locations and in others by planters weighing 600 or 1 000 pounds and stationed in positions that prevent vehicles from passing in between we have used planters as a pedestrian safeguard in this way at numerous locations throughout the city

7944732 although these requirements drove many small and medium size manufacturing companies out of the state dermazone solutions chose to see this as a business opportunity
7944733 we believe that pharmaceutical sellers will embrace manufacturing pharmaceuticals under these very strict pedigree policy and procedures this will ensure them the finest quality product available in the u s a benefit they can pass to their consumers
7944734 im not finalizing that but yeah if i could tilt one way or another id tilt that way
7944735 if youre not excited about this you have no pulse
7944736 it gives you a chance to go outside the league its something new and different it gives you added exposure added games it gives the fans a chance to see something different its added visibility for everyone so for you not be excited you have to be almost dead
7944737 theres a spirit and an energy in the locker room everyones excited about it because were not only representing the impact but canada in general
7944738 a lot is standing on this game for the pride and reputation of the club and canada
7944739 i wouldnt say the season is gone just because we spent a couple of days in last place
7944740 a lot of people are saying how bad the impact is doing but we can still finish in third or fourth place which is good considering where weve been this year
7944741 we have some guys that live in similar countries and others who have been to similar countries
7944742 its not going to be much of an adjustment if any
7944743 its not like were going to play at altitude or something like that we just have to be careful about little things like nutrition but were only going to stay at the hotel and go to the stadium to play
7944744 jeg er meget i tvivl om om regeringen overhovedet ved hvad den vil med de her trepartsdr ftelser det giver jo ikke meget mening at spille ud med alt muligt som er helt uden politisk realitet hvis der skal komme noget fornuftigt ud af forl bet s er det n dt til at v re helt anderledes forpligtende

7945015 their tax returns recently revealed that in 2000 their combined income was 240 505
7945016 in 2006 by contrast the obamas combined income was 983 826
7945017 a food manufacturer servicing primarily the retail grocery and food service chains
7945018 the obamas best financial year came in 2005 when their total combined income was 1 6 million that included 1 2 million in author fees for sen obamas best selling books michelle obamas salary that year was 316 962 plus another 45 000 for her role as director of treehouse foods the obamas became more charitable as their incomes grew in 2000 the couple gave 2 350 to charity or about 1 percent of their gross income in 2006 they donated 60 307 to charities or about 6 percent of their gross income in 2005 the obamas list a 5 000 donation to their church trinity united church of christ in chicago where the controversial rev jeremiah a wright jr was sen obamas pastor if sen obama tithed more regularly to the church theres no record of it in these tax returns

7945024 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7945025 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behaviour
7945026 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place
7945027 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 39c and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7945028 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7945029 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7945030 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7945031 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
7945032 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7945033 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images
7945034 ranting about how americans and israelis are the real terrorists and that democracy is really fascist

7945038 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
7945039 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
7945040 a lot of the fall is due to the increase in public coverage
7945041 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
7945042 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
7945043 weve got some big plans ahead with more resources and amazons expertise in building a platform where people come to share ideas there are a lot of new opportunities in the future that will benefit each of you in the meantime youll continue to have access to the great community and tools that youve always known and used on the site

7945110 what they said was that if i just got the 7 200 i would have two loan payments
7945111 if i refinanced the whole thing they said i would get the money to fix the foundation but my monthly payments would be the same as before
7945112 the final figures came out to around 100 000 with all the fees and closing costs and when i read the papers a few days later i said goll ee
7945113 the new loan payments were about 900 a month with my original loan i was paying insurance and taxes in the loan but with the new loan i found out that that stuff wasnt included they told me it was a fixed interest rate but i found out later it was variable so every few years my interest rate was going to go higher i found out i was going to be pricing myself out of my own home
7945114 when it got closer to the deadline for closing they pushed me and pushed me and wanted it done quickly
7945115 i was like most people taking out loans like this i wasnt knowledgeable of the fine print and they did like they do telling me to sign here sign here sign here i was done with the closing in 10 minutes but i feel i was taken advantage of because of being na ve
7945116 he was supposed to have a higher cash out 7 200 for the foundation repair at the end of the loan and he never got that
7945117 the loan didnt make any sense for him he had a lower interest rate that was then increased
7945118 he had some problems with his job but he kept making the payments
7945119 he sold his furniture to keep the payments active but he eventually got behind the problem here is that ameriquest pushed a loan upon him that only made sense for them making money off him and they disregarded many things they had told him about what the loan would be when they presented it to him for signing
7945120 continues to be engaged in discussions with a number of state attorneys general and regulators about the companys business practices
7945121 we are focused on resolving the issues under discussion with these agencies and hope to reach a reasonable resolution that is fair to our customers and fair to the company
7945122 promise certain interest rates and fees only to change those rates at the time of the closing
7945123 i dont want anything for free here i dont want a free house
7945124 i want to pay my fair share i just want someone to work with me so i can make my mortgage payment and make it fair for me and them but i really felt ameriquest took advantage of me so they could make more money from me
7945125 some subprime loans do allow people to buy a house who might not qualify otherwise
7945126 loan scumbuckets are targeting people with crappy loans that they know will cause people to lose their houses
7945127 the buyer has to watch out in buying a home or refinancing one but you have to avoid paternalistic government regulations here as well
7945128 you have to make credit available to people who are not just a1 credit users
7945129 if you ask for too much government control youre going to make it impossible for many people to realize the american dream of home ownership laws and regulations should address major abuse in appraisals in bait and switch tactics and in preying on the elderly but legislators are always anxious to see a problem and write a law and not look at what is already on the books this is a very complex issue not something you give a knee jerk reaction to
7945130 the lenders are putting people at risk but they dont really care because they have gotten paid and they move on to the next sale
7945131 the big killer is going to be the variable interest rates people are going to have higher monthly payments and theyll have to deal with balloon payments i just think more and more people are going to be squeezed out of their homes and that is very difficult to come back from the foreclosure rate in texas is going to go through the roof in a few years
7945132 there were so many things they were charging us for that were just not in our contract
7945133 every time we called to get answers we got the runaround it was like chasing your own tail with these people but when you try to rock the foreclosure boat with these people they have the upper hand they just throw you into foreclosure
7945134 we had 20 000 equity when we moved in and now we owe more than the house is worth
7945135 i know our credit wasnt perfect but i just get the feeling they were trying to figure out ways to get our interest rate higher our interest rate now goes up every six months
7945136 our mortgage was passed along to a new lender and then all the problems started we got in so deep but it wasnt all our fault its almost like they wanted to do this they forced us into a higher loan deal and we are having real problems dealing with that
7945137 they are milking it as far as they can right now
7945138 whatever it takes to keep the money circulating the lenders and realtors and builders keep abusing the system
7945139 if the property value doesnt work out they inflate those numbers too
7945140 its all to make the housing prices high and the loans high then the commissions get higher
7945141 what is going on is loan fraud and everyone knows it
7945142 its not just a violation of the states 80 percent rule it is a violation of federal and state law appraisal standards it happens mostly in refinancing
7945143 i have done appraisals for loan officers and when the number didnt come in with what they wanted i got fired and they found someone who would do it
7945144 very often i was asked to do an appraisal and then got called back two or three weeks later they would tell me i needed to raise the value 30 000 or 40 000 then the loan would be bigger but they could care less if the borrower had little chance of paying it back
7945145 it is just so common now because the whole business is built around keeping prices inflated
7945146 i was asked to do an appraisal for a home where the couple couldnt make the balloon payment
7945147 the whole problem is that no one wants to fix it
7945148 the elected officials know what is going on but they know that the housing industry helps them get elected as long as the economic train is on the track and moving forward they dont care what goes in the firebox but there is going to be a lot to pay when all these loans start falling apart in a few years when interest rates are going up it is something no one wants to think about right now there is too much money flying around
7945149 the government has a goal of increasing home ownership among those with marginalized credit
7945150 that is not a bad thing on basic merit but the real estate business is inflating prices and putting that on the backs of the risk borrowers if not for the nothing down market the building business would grind to a halt
7945151 when these loans dont get paid the taxpayers are going to have to cover them
7945152 everyone likes to portray these foundations as groups that are helping out the poor and getting them into home ownership but it is all about getting around laws and inflating prices in the market that house went from 85 000 to 93 000 the borrower now has a bigger loan to cover thats not helping the poor
7945153 allowing these new organizations to flourish has increased the percentage of fha insured households with relatively high probabilities of default and foreclosure
7945154 to say these are charity organizations helping the poor is insulting
7945155 there needs to be a stop on all this the fha is insane for allowing this because they are allowing 110 percent to be paid for a house by people who cannot afford that these nonprofits are nothing more than clearinghouses for the lending industry
7945156 laws were passed so that buyers couldnt donate the down payment to a buyer and then increase the purchase price
7945157 so the lending industry came up with a plan to launder the money through nonprofits they are making megabucks using these nonprofits hud needs to see what is happening
7945158 homeownership is more than just a symbol of the american dream it is an important part of our way of life core american values of individuality thrift responsibility and self reliance are embodied in homeownership
7945159 has way too much power and influence in the legislative process and thats why consumer issues are tougher laws to pass
7945160 in this particular battle the lenders and bankers win most of the time not the joe blow homeowners we can do more the realtors have worked hard at changing some of our predatory lending laws they are looking out for consumers because that is their business but we need to balance out business interest with consumers protection in a fair way
7945161 people get embarrassed when they default on a loan and fade into the background
7945162 they need to come forward and learn from this and make the politicians aware i think there are a lot of sharks out in the water right now buying a house is the biggest caveat emptor there is and that is truer now than ever before
7945163 in the late 80s even as the market went down you still had equity in your house but now were seeing more and more people with upside down loans owing more than their house is really worth
7945164 you have to pay all these people you havent seen people telling you what to do people having control over your long term debt
7945165 but if you cant afford a 150 000 house dont do it if the lenders are pushing the maximum amount step back a bit it could lead to serious trouble

7945545 last year the world got hit by a heroin tsunami almost 700 tonnes this year the opium flood waters have started to recede
7945546 if hilmand were a country it would once again be the worlds biggest producer of illicit drugs
7945547 there is now a perfect overlap between zones of high risk and regions of high opium cultivation
7945548 since drugs are funding insurgency and insurgency enables drug cultivation insurgency and narcotics must be fought together

7945550 the international community should help afghanistan tackle its massive cannabis problem
7945551 afghanistans drug control strategy should be to consolidate and reduce
7945552 afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world and the latest food crisis has made farmers even more vulnerable opium is a seasonal plant it may be gone today but back again tomorrow
7945553 this must be done now while farmers are deciding whether or not to plant opium for the 2008 9 harvest timely and targeted international assistance is vital
7945554 these provinces particularly daykundi and zabul are ripe for the same kind of success that we witnessed in badakshan and nangarhar this year lets make them opium free in 2009
7945555 these are higher value targets than farmers fields if heroin processing and trafficking are blocked the domestic price of opium would drop even further
7945556 such an inelastic response suggests that vast amounts of opium heroin and morphine thousand of tonnes have been withheld from the market
7945557 where is this opium who is stockpiling it and why this is a ticking time bomb for public health and global security
7945558 corrupt officials landowners warlords and criminals must feel the full force of the law otherwise the opium economy will continue to operate with impunity and the taliban will continue to profit from it
7945559 i am disappointed that so far neither afghanistan nor any other un member states have come forward with any names
7945560 preventing these chemicals from reaching afghanistan will make heroin production a much riskier and costlier business
7945561 drugs and terrorists should not determine the fate of afghanistan

7945641 i told the idiot to stop making so much noise or hed frighten the ducks thats when we heard a roar and knew our assumption was not correct
7945642 we froze when we saw who or rather what it was
7945643 as he approached i was too scared to raise my gun also the odor of him was kinda distracting he smelled like week old garbage
7945644 before he could pound us in frustration we desperately pointed at the live ducks that had landed in the lake when bigfoot saw them he bounded after them
7945645 we decided to teach him how to catch his dinner its always better to have bigfoot as your friend than your enemy first we showed him how to use a duck whistle
7945646 bigfoot seemed amused by the sound now that his savage breast had been soothed we turned to the surviving decoy
7945647 then i waded into the water to show him what he had to do
7945648 with his huge lung capacity we knew bigfoot would be able to go underwater and stay down long enough for the ducks to return
7945649 when they did bigfoot burst from the water and grabbed six of the little beauties in his big hands still wearing the decoy he slogged toward us carrying his quacking struggling prize
7945650 bigfoot came ashore and gazed at the waterfowl trapped in his big hairy paws
7945651 he suddenly looked very sad with a big sigh he opened his fingers and let the ducks fly away
7945652 perhaps it was wrong to shoot these innocent creatures for sport after all bigfoot could have killed us but didnt
7945653 i hope we havent seen the last of the big guy
7945654 after guzzling all our beer he made us rethink drinking as well hes been a very good influence
7945655 i found last nights coverage of the floor by fox to be outrageous everybody was african american and most looked bored i couldnt believe how obviously slanted the camera work seemed to be dnc officials are fools i think theyre wasting our donations for letting this event to be abused that way what a waste of our money to have it be covered that way do something about it please august 26 2008 12 17 pm

7945661 we remain excited about the business and partnerships we have built through virgin comics and are working towards a restructuring that properly takes the business forward the decision to scale down the new york operations and concentrate on core activities is due to the current macro economic downturn and is in no way a reflection on the dedicated and valuable employees we have had the privilege to work with

7945668 he is a player i have full admiration for i remember him at aberdeen where he was held in such high esteem that sunderland eventually paid 1million for his services
7945669 unfortunately he had no sooner signed than he picked up an injury and obviously he ended up finding it hard to get back into roy keanes side

7945674 they have found that the stresses and strains within the system are within acceptable limits but they have identified a few areas where they feel we are not optimising the contact point between the stress that is necessary to make any job interesting and at the same time making sure that the officers are not overstressed
7945675 the number of people employed in the home team has in fact increased over a period of time but the demands on the home team probably has outstripped even that increase
7945676 we have instructed the home team departments to step up recruitment we are also reviewing our employment criteria and job scopes to see if we can accept new sources of manpower in specific areas for instance we have already started re employing retired officers
7945677 unfortunately by allowing foreign law firms to practise singapore law even in limited areas the government could well be dealing a fatal blow to the nascent efforts of our local law firms to develop and go regional
7945678 local firms will not be able to compete with the packages of the large foreign firms we are seeing this already and this will have a knock down effect to the legal service which has already witnessed a brain drain to the local private sector even without these new players in the market
7945679 so the point really is where does the balance in policy making lie do we protect the local law firms in their current structure and deny if necessary the opportunities for the young lawyers and deny the request of the consumers in order to preserve the existing benefits
7945680 do we move in a way that will preserve the local law firms that are able to compete and at the same time open up the choices for the consumers and the younger lawyers

7945683 the insistence of judiciary officials to carry out these brutal executions in rapid succession despite domestic and international outcries only demonstrates a shocking thirst for blood on behalf of the authorities

7945853 it has long been my view since i was a page in the u s house of representatives that there are far too many lawyers in congress spending tax dollars my father and brother were lawyers and in money matters they had some short comings with my economics background i bring a total picture overview to problems like a farmer does when he decides what to plant
7945854 my father was in congress on the defense committee he taught me how to run the place the house is very different than the senate it is where the spending bills start a good president has to know how to work it after my father was killed in a car accident i had to raise my seven brothers and sisters and help my widowed mother
7945855 i learned leaders are born you can not make one you have to be tough strong and fair the leader will rise up to the occasion by a physical force beyond explanation that is why my no strike first peace plan of july 14th had such a dramatic effect on the downward price of oil thus my nick name gas pump boyle

7945858 the current distribution of regional economic power is unlike anything that was predicted even a decade ago the rise of the developing world its growing share in global output and far greater share of global growth is perhaps a quantitative but not a qualitative surprise the qualitative surprise is this with almost all the industrial world in or near recession much of the momentum in the global economy is coming from countries with authoritarian governments that are pursuing economic strategies directed towards wealth accumulation and building up geopolitical strength rather than improving living standards for their populations china where household consumption has now fallen below 40 per cent of its gross domestic product which must be some kind of peacetime record is the most extreme example similar tendencies however can be seen in other parts of asia russia and other oil exporting countries

7945860 potential economic impact of climate change will vary in important ways at the subcontinental level in the united states it is possible that some states will see significant net economic benefits from warming while others may see substantial losses for winter sports activities such as skiing there appears to be less ambiguity although even for this industry some locations may see benefits through shifts towards warm weather activities reductions in the incidence of weather that is too cold for comfortable enjoyment of the slopes and shifts in existing demand to areas where conditions remain favorable the geographic variability discussed here suggests the need for state and local policies in some areas rather than purely national policies to prepare for the potential effects of climate change moreover looking beyond u s borders these economic effects are likely to be more challenging for less advanced economies in africa and asia due to their heavier reliance on resource based economic activity especially agriculture more limited economic infrastructure and lower incomes all of which intensify the severity of the economic tradeoffs involved

7946121 there are more than enough voters to take him as he is
7946122 the main goal this week is not really to define obama or define john mccain
7946123 its really to define the the election about the campaign that does that the best wins the election
7946124 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
7946125 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
7946126 the opening is to talk at any opportunity not to wait three weeks to have a meeting obviously that indicates a fundamental difference between the government and the opposition parties
7946127 well have to judge whether its appropriate to ask people to vote twice in the space of a few weeks
7946128 despite its optimistic oversimplifications the released study indicates that the tank would certainly have demised high up in the atmosphere

7946163 the only way that the firm can be dissolved is if the firms executive committee voting to dissolve the firm
7946164 we took the name because there is great value in the name
7946165 the name still represents high quality and tenacious work on behalf of our clients
7946166 i am not a hundred percent convinced that a dismissal of all the charges based on the case disposition agreement that allows the firm to escape the consequences of the guilty plea to these charges is an appropriate disposition of he case
7946167 in ruling on this motion the courts discretion is extremely limited

7946206 i have been to so many tournaments and so many places in the world but i have to say i am so impressed with the asian poker tour and macau this is the first time i have been here
7946207 i thought las vegas was the gambling capital of the world but i was wrong it feels like coming home
7946208 were delighted that so many world class names want to be part of the asian poker tour to have vegas legends jack binion and doyle brunson in macau to kick off off the tournament is truly significant both are pioneers and were around at the start in vegas and it really says something that they want to mark what we think will herald the start of a poker explosion in macau with the presence of online qualifiers from around the world too the asian poker tour has a very bright future were proud to make history by holding asias biggest guaranteed tournament
7946209 as more moderate growth in display advertising was partially offset by continued weakness in online recruitment advertising
7946210 the wsop academy is coming off another amazing summer at the world series of poker that saw one of our academy grads again at a final table just days after attending our camp and were now excited to offer our first academy experience in los angeles and welcome 2008 wsop bracelet winner kenny tran one of las most noted poker professionals to our family of instructors
7946211 like all of our wsop academy events our los angeles event will give players the confidence and skills they need to be a threat at the table whether theyre playing in a home game with friends or at the world series of poker against the best in the game
7946212 i look forward to working with wsop academy students in los angeles to help them see inside their opponents and change the way they view the game
7946213 i plan on spending time working with players individually and spotting tells that they are giving off at the table i truly believe that this type of personalized attention can save a player a lot of money in the long run
7946214 the academys tournament is an exciting way for our participants to put into action what theyve learned over the day and test their wits at the table against the worlds best like annie duke and kenny tran

7946222 its not like it was years ago when personal shoppers worked with only select clients
7946223 the biggest misconception about personal shopping is that people think theres a fee its free
7946224 we do wardrobe edits and even bring clothes over for our clients to try at home
7946225 jewel tones are particularly important emeralds reds and most of all purple which has a rocker chic vibe
7946226 one of the strongest trends is country chic rich fabrics and textured tweeds theres an emphasis on layered casual put together looks a dress with a minimalist shape is so versatile and vivid beautiful jewel toned colors are key
7946227 the last thing a personal shopper wants to be is intimidating we can help customers figure out what they really need
7946228 i believe in the luxurious comfort of cashmere sweater dressing belted and layered topping wide leg pants worn with flats
7946229 and before you ask were not supporting sixaxis its useless
7946230 i said earlier my experience may help a little and that definitely may have been the difference on one or two points in the match
7946231 but our construction work has been halted because of lack of materials we are expecting these on the next shipment from overseas
7946232 if escape were possible dont you think more people would try
7946233 those that do get out usually disappear all together or get trapped somewhere even more hellish
7946234 i hope to inspire my new countrymen and lead britain to olympic gold in 2012 while at the same time prolonging my international career without the need for oxygen tents media manipulation or having to ask tom cruise for a favour
7946235 a unified team will be great news for england and give us a back door we need to finally break the jocks and take over the uk thereby confirming the scots deepest suspicions

7946243 the atrium sat 30 and sub 10 are designed to create a swiss army knife sub sat system for installers and consumers
7946244 they can mount almost anywhere around a pool a deck a walkway or even a garden without upsetting the outdoor design all the while giving customers premium sound quality from a name that they know and trust
7946245 i think nokia needs something more distinctive going forward truly new products rather than devices that look like a refresh of previous products on a slightly different form factor
7946246 if we dont win those kinds of states were going to be in that pardon my language i know its early that proverbial s t house for four more years ok sisters and brothers that is where we will be
7946247 you cant vote for barack obama because hes black thats his color and that is bulls t that is absolute bulls t
7946248 we have to argue fight our own members and were gong to do it
7946249 contrary to the principles of georgias independence sovereignty and territorial integrity
7946250 in this context the presidency of the eu forcefully recalls its attachment to the principle of georgias territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders
7946251 will examine from this viewpoint the consequences of russias decision
7946252 we are making our best effort to balance free expression with the need for public safety
7946253 it is hard to avoid arresting people who are bound and determined to get arrested
7946254 gerade in einer zeit wo einige wenige jugendliche mit ihren brutalen gewalttaten eine ganze generation in verruf bringen ist es wohltuend zu erleben dass besonders die menschen denen es gut geht in unserer gesellschaft auch an die denken die es nicht immer leicht haben

7946257 is extremely concerned by this serious incident and the circumstances will be investigated it is closely monitoring the situation and calls on all parties to exercise restraint
7946258 do you have two brothers oh my gosh i used to babysit you

7946260 um no james dean but thanks and not a new obession an old one
7946261 the benefits of the program accrued very quickly and are very large
7946262 if i were this old man mugabe the events of this week would have convinced me that at 84 years old its now time to ride into the sunset and never re appear on the political scene again
7946263 many of us ruling party mps realise that fact and we will be aligning with the opposition
7946264 the research is clear if developed countries spent the same amount of money on preventing deforestation and the destruction of peatlands as they do on misguided biofuel subsidies 15bn this would halve the total costs of tackling climate change
7946265 in addition to this the protection of these habitats yields a plethora of valuable eco system services particularly in the poorest countries
7946266 this approach would be dramatically cheaper than any other means of achieving the same result to be truly effective a global response is needed but the uk has an opportunity to lead the way
7946267 in the uk we can dramatically increase funding for forest and peatland projects domestically and with key partners especially in south east asia as well as lobbying at an international level for the right global policies
7946268 forest and peatland conservation is one of the few methods at our disposal where we can do this now and at low cost
7946269 this report is timely and welcome it is becoming increasingly clear that unless we find a practical solution to the problems caused by deforestation the battle against climate change is in danger of being lost
7946270 the hypocrisy of the government is staggering while ministers are calling for the international community to look at the impact of biofuels here in the uk the governments policy means people are filling up their cars with biofuels that may be damaging the environment and endangering food security
7946271 the gamer generation tends to be less risk averse and more willing to try things even in the face of overfailure
7946272 its not the main focus of the field yet but there is a little data we can extrapolate from it
7946273 the other is task orientation i want to get better i want to learn the skills and improve them
7946274 the young college bound population that have played lots of different types of video games it may have caused them to develop some sort of general skill sets to figure out the lay of the land in a complex challenging environment
7946275 because theyve done that in games theyre good at seeing what is the goal and how do you win at the game
7946276 if the game is to get a high gpa so how do you do that what are the strategies it was an eerie conversation to have
7946277 people create avatars that idealize or express who they are and oftentimes they choose characters whose features are exaggerated so it has a kind of multiplication effect your avatar has more of those traits that you want and then some of those effects persist outside the game environment
7946278 people will say i never thought of myself as a leader in life and then they become a guild leader and they got something out of that
7946279 its really dependent on what a player brings to a game

7946283 america must stand firmly on the side of freedom and justice
7946284 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7946285 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7946286 the single most important thing i have to make clear is the choice we have in november between the same failed policy of the last eight years for the middle class and the new agenda to boost income for americans and help families who are struggling
7946287 in missouri a battleground state republican ads say i would raise taxes but my plan would provide three times more tax relief to the middle class
7946288 i dont think people realize that and i hope that message is absorbed by the electorate
7946289 this is a product that would work well for a lot of small and medium sized businesses but those are not the type of businesses who think about emc as the vendor of choice

7946291 itll be hard not being involved in mgs5 but ive got the utmost confidence that hideo kojima ken imaizumi and our amazing team will put together another blockbuster game ill be cheering from the sidelines
7946292 if the hardware technology rises then obviously you know my future games wont be based on the hardware anymore probably i will first create the software and then um its a strange word to say but port to other hardware if that technological ability rises in all areas
7946293 what kind of disturbs me sometimes because a lot of people ask me about this ps3 360 question is that its not about the hardware i want people to look at the game itself sometimes i even feel like it should be on a pc so that people dont ask me about hardware and platforms
7946294 in the near future i hope theyll ask me about metal gear about us about our future projects and will stop caring about the hardware

7946297 this speech will be history in the making and will be watched by millions its so much better fun if you can have a flutter on it too im told that obama has some irish ancestry so im sure he wont be short of a word or two it would be quite funny if he opened up with life is like a box of chocolates who knows maybe hell have a bet and do just that
7946298 shuster i have no idea what youre talking about have you been sleeping the past couple months do you never watch this show you usually sleep through this show because you didnt show up three times in a row
7946299 the barack obama campaign started late to try to reach out to latinos
7946300 they basically gave up the latino vote in the primaries to hillary clinton and theres a struggle now
7946301 polls show that latinos are thinking of voting for obama theyre obviously thinking about voting democratic
7946302 after a couple of electoral seasons when a specific number of latinos went to the republican party up to 40 per cent of latinos voted for george bush in 2004 they are going back to the democratic party because they dont like the way things are going in the country they dont like the immigration rhetoric they dont like the economy they dont like the war
7946303 the level of support that obama has among latinos is still not high enough
7946304 think obama is too young he doesnt understand the us chinese relationship and he really doesnt understand chinas issues
7946305 there really is a reason why during the primaries the super delegates and many influential black people lined up behind hillary
7946306 there was something so different about obama that people needed to be convinced that he was united with the black community in america
7946307 the truth is this is a different guy and hes different in many ways because hes not like african americans are and people know that

7946311 the technology available today is light years ahead of what was generally available just five years ago
7946312 add those advancements to increasing technical expertise as we learn more about graphically creating immersive worlds and the conditions are right to have graphics play a major role in telling the story of a game
7946313 cevat yerli and crytek are not only major names in germany but also the global video game market

7946322 security has made it very difficult to get near the dnc venues but the truth trucks just cant be ignored
7946323 its down a million i think its great for those million who got it but i think its meaningless in the sense theres still 46 million people who dont have any health insurance in this country
7946324 were the greatest country in the world we ought to be able to deliver health care to everybody at an efficient cost
7946325 i promise you within the first year with barack obama as president of the united states were going to have national health care
7946326 confirms what americas struggling families already know that over the past seven years our economy has moved backwards
7946327 an additional 7 2 million americans have fallen into the ranks of the uninsured this is the failed record of george bushs economic policies that senator mccain has called great progress
7946328 i hope its true that people still have more insurance but in my state were in recession
7946329 so thats a little bit old news and i hope its true but im nervous about the future

7946480 previous research has shown milk to be an effective rehydration solution while this is the first study to suggest that drinking milk following muscle damaging exercise may decrease muscle damage

7946541 ambassador khalilzad had planned to meet socially with zardari during his personal vacation
7946542 but because zardari is now a presidential candidate ambassador khalilzad postponed the meeting after consulting with senior state department officials and zardari himself
7946543 why do i have to learn about this from asif after its all set up
7946544 we have maintained a public line that we are not involved in the politics or the details we are merely keeping in touch with the parties can i say that honestly if youre providing advice and help please advise and help me so that i understand whats going on here
7946545 it is not possible to conduct coherent foreign policy if senior officials are freelancing
7946546 i know that zardaris interest in becoming president has been clear for quite some time
7946547 it distresses me that the u s government has not learned yet that having our guy is not a winning strategy in pakistan
7946548 whoever our guy is isnt going to be the only guy in town and if we go into it with that view well bump up against a lot of other guys in pakistan
7946549 mr khalilzad being a political animal understood the value of reaching out to pakistans political leadership long before the bureaucrats at the state department realized this would be useful at a future date
7946550 did not make policy or change policy he just became an alternate channel
7946551 we are entering parliament with a clear agenda and they should wake up with the stark realities of the day
7946552 one of the things that has held this country back is the issue of corruption resources are not being distributed in a way that is fair to the vast majority of people
7946553 what youre seeing now is the rise of the voice of people wanting change for a broader constituency than just the elite
7946554 the issue is whether its the best and most strategic move for him now

7946560 i our distiller vineyard managers and our cellar master felt 89 was going to be truly memorable and deserved special attention we selected grapes from the best plots of grande champagne using only eau de vie from four plots gensac juillac st m me and touzac on our own estates and left the wine for 18 years in limousin oak casks when we held our annual tasting in 2007 cellar master pierrette trichet felt that the 89 was approaching its peak
7946561 i had my emotional moment when anxiety hit and i couldnt control it i didnt want to take anything because i was attempting to breast feed my husband was going home to sleep because he has back problems rods pins and fused areas of his spine and wasnt doing well sleeping in the hospitals chair
7946562 but when he saw how upset i was he ended up staying the night and we shared the hospital bed together and it was the best moment ever and i will never forget it
7946563 rob was awesome he worked ten hours a day but still took care of the dishes the laundry and walking our dog we decided to hire a monthly cleaning service to take care of deep cleaning but rob really took on many of the duties i know he hates
7946564 i just stare at my son and cry i just love him so much it almost hurts
7946565 i was determined to breast feed madeline before she was even born but i had no idea how difficult and hard it would be for us the nurses in the hospital were not much help and because she was born on a saturday the lactation nurse was unavailable i tried and tried but felt like such a failure
7946566 i had my mom there to cook clean and help me with anything i needed my husband took two weeks off to help and bond with madeline but the one thing they couldnt help me with was nursing we had a doula at our birth and she came over to help she introduced me to soothies and a nipple shield i also went to the mother and baby wellness center associated with my hospital and the la leche league and got one on one assistance after many days without success the nurse at the wellness center finally discovered that madeline had an underdeveloped sucking mechanism she taught me how to help madeline develop a proper sucking method
7946567 i never expected that breastfeeding would be so difficult i figured put the breast out and let her suck away there were times when i thought i wasnt producing enough milk or that isabella wasnt getting enough because shed constantly fall asleep while nursing also being on call to nurse every two to three hours was grueling i never left isabellas side for the first two months
7946568 because i had a c section no one knew the extent of my recovery
7946569 between rob my mom and sister there was someone with me around the clock for the first week after that my mom went back to work but spent the night so that i would have help with night feedings and such i think i just appreciated the fact that my husband never questioned when id get back to normal he just let me recover in my own time and allowed me to relax of course having my mom and sister around to help him wasnt so bad had we been alone things might have been a bit more chaotic
7946570 ethan was so supportive madeline had colic so we would take turns rocking her patting her bottom and walking around the house he was a big help in that aspect

7946572 we are a boot strap company and we know how difficult it is to start and maintain a business

7946580 to truly love something you must first give it a chance to fail if it survives it is going to be stronger than ever distance is pure proof of this and forever we will love if we survive i know i cant be there baby its alright ill be waiting for you tonight i pray that youll be there when i close my eyes meet me in my dreams tonight if you think missing me is hard you should try missing you the few hours i spent with you are worth the thousand hours i spend without you so close your eyes and sleep to dream im by your side no words to speak well set our course and make it through no matter how far i go my heart remains with you

7946605 our goal is that by june 2009 the sons of iraq are out of business
7946606 the last time tens of thousands of armed sunni men were humiliated in iraq by disbanding the baath party and iraqi army in may 2003 an insurgency began costing thousands of u s lives and throwing iraq into chaos yet maliki and his advisors risk provoking iraqs sunni community into another round of violence
7946607 it doesnt take 100 000 of these guys to revert to insurgents to cause big trouble remember at the height of the insurgency the u s estimated that there were 8 000 20 000 fighters

7946634 the story printed in the sunday august 24 2008 glasgow sunday herald claiming a security breach of best western guest information is grossly unsubstantiated claims reported about our central reservations customer records are not accurate we at best western take the confidentiality of our customers personal information very seriously the sunday herald reporter brought to our attention the possible compromise of a select portion of data at a single hotel we investigated immediately and provided commentary best western would have welcomed the opportunity to fact check the story which would have resulted in more accurate and credible reporting on the part of the newspaper we have found no evidence to support the sensational claims ultimately made by the reporter and newspaper
7946635 once the information was online experts estimate that it would take less than an hour to write and run a software bot a simple computer programme capable of harvesting every record on best westerns european reservation system with eight million people staying in the hotel groups 86 375 continental rooms every year gaining access to the system is a major coup for the cyber criminals responsible given that criminals now have access to all bookings from 2007 2008 and based on the fbi sponsored internet crime complaint centers reports that the average victim of internet crime loses 356 they are sitting on a potential haul of at least 2 84bn
7946636 the reporter asserted the recent compromise of data for past guests from as far back as 2007 best western purges all online reservations promptly upon guest departure
7946637 there was one instance of suspicious activity at a single hotel with respect to 13 guests who are being notified we are working with the fbi and international authorities to investigate the source of the other claims which were never presented to us for investigation prior to publication of the herald story we have found no suspicious activity to support them

7946880 weve all since re entered the real world in varying professions but are still avid viewers its not exactly something i talk about with the other investment banking folks at the office though
7946881 as old friends i think doug originally was trying to play it cool and act like lcs lack of attention wasnt that big of a deal thats a smart angle and definitely intrigued her enough to continue seeing him it was a solid play to stay behind with her at stephanies b day party showing his support in a tough situation in the end though i think it must be hard for lc to date anyone her life has been documented on tv forever so it would be tough to gauge anyones true intent
7946882 im gonna be on that tv in a couple minutes yo thats crazy
7946883 kara was my roommate and i took her all around the world with me and introduced her to wonderful people she stayed in sweden and wrote with these people and got started living her dream
7946884 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
7946885 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7946886 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
7946887 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
7946888 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported

7946892 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
7946893 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt

7946896 earlier this week we released a beta of the android sdk
7946897 in the accompanying post i mentioned that we had to remove some apis from the platform for android 1 0 and as a result they dont appear in the 0 9 beta sdk and wont appear in 1 0 compatible sdks
7946898 even once that issue was resolved we recognized that we could not trust the identity of the application who sent the request
7946899 an android application using gtalkservice would be reachable from all of the users google talk friends and a flaw in that application could pose an inviting target to a malicious friend or automated malware
7946900 the reason is that we plain ran out of time
7946901 bluetooth api was pretty far along but needs some clean up before we can commit to it for the sdk keep in mind that putting it in the 1 0 sdk would have locked us into that api for years to come

7946921 informamos a nbsp nuestro pueblo al bur pol tico y al comit central que dadas las circunstancias se ha hecho el recuento de fuerzas y cada compa ero y estructura se encuentra ocupando su lugar correspondiente conscientes de que este momento demanda una estricta disciplina como producto de las convicciones revolucionarias nos reportamos en completa disposici n a las rdenes que dispongan la comandancia nbsp general y el comit central dispuestos a asumir los retos que demande la presente etapa de lucha a nuestro pueblo le preguntamos qu hacer ante la euforia de ultraderecha ante la ofensiva policiaco militar resistencia organizada combinando todas las formas de lucha o resignaci n poniendo la otra mejilla
7946922 el comit estatal del pdpr epr del estado de chiapas manifiesta que con el pretexto del combate a la delincuencia organizada y narcotr fico el gobierno de la ultraderecha representada por felipe calder n hinojosa intenta contener toda manifestaci n de oposici n a su r gimen mediante acciones fascistas asesoradas por las diferentes estructuras de inteligencia extranjeras representadas por los gobiernos m s sanguinarios de este siglo entre ellos el norteamericano el espa ol nbsp y el israel demandamos enf ticamente del comit central y bur pol tico que tome en sus manos directamente el caso de oaxaca y que determinen las decisiones nbsp correspondientes porque la militancia como dice la consigna estamos presentes y resueltos a vencer consideramos que el deber de todo militante de todo revolucionario es identificarnos en la acci n como producto de las convicciones ideol gicas son tiempo de unidad tanto en el terreno revolucionario como en la lucha popular
7946923 los compa eros aprehendidos que siguen siendo torturados fueron a causa de un se alamiento aclaramos la fuerza est en la prudencia todo lo hemos resuelto privilegiando soluciones pol ticas pero tambi n el pueblo nos ha dado el derecho de la autodefensa por lo tanto podr amos cambiar de t ctica y si en esta t ctica de autodefensa la hacemos como tales agotando la soluci n pol tica y dando otro paso
7946924 hemos recibido de todos nuestros comit s estatales y regionales la disposici n de recibir rdenes por lo que se ordena a todo militante y combatiente a concentrarse a sus unidades correspondientes y mantenerse en alerta general quien no lo haga ser tomado como un desertor
7946925 por el trato que la mayor a de los medios impresos y electr nicos est n dando a nuestros comunicados existe la seguridad de que nuevamente la censura y la autocensura se aplique por comisi n omisi n o convicci n sin embargo por tica profesional no deber an detenerse en cumplir su importante labor de difundir nuestra postura ante los acontecimientos del pa s y mucho menos cuando est en juego la vida de dos luchadores sociales sin importar la forma de lucha de la cual son part cipes pero tambi n se ha contado con la solidaridad de gente honesta y con un alto valor civil para quienes se gu an en los marcos del periodismo mercantil preguntamos qu necesitamos hacer para ser considerados noticia o ser necesario que aparezcan los cuerpos de nuestros compa eros para que esto sea primicia
7946926 la presencia de los operativos militares desplegados en gran parte de nuestra rep blica no han servido para nada en la lucha contra la delincuencia organizada por el contrario se ha agudizado m s la disputa interna de los grupos de poder en los lugares donde ellos operan vinculados con los grupos del crimen organizado agradecemos la solidaridad desinteresada de todas aquellas organizaciones y personas nacionales e internacionales quienes a pesar de los riesgos y consecuencias que traigan estos pronunciamientos a favor de nuestros compa eros desaparecidos se han manifestado si el actual estado de derecho el estado de derecho olig rquico en lugar de castigar a los responsables de la represi n de las masacres de los cr menes de lesa humanidad proporciona a estos chacales protecci n e impunidad tengan por seguro que sin fecha y hora fija nuestro pueblo ejercer su leg timo derecho de hacerse justicia
7946927 resulta insultante para la inteligencia del pueblo que las autoridades estatales de oaxaca y federales pretendan eludir su responsabilidad en la detenci n desaparici n de nuestros compa eros con el c nico tr mite de
7946928 ante la actitud hip crita y fascista de este gobierno ileg timo de profundizar la guerra sucia y el terrorismo de estado como su principal pol tica contra los luchadores sociales los ponentes pol ticos y los revolucionarios ante la creciente escalada de represi n contra nuestro pueblo los luchadores sociales y activistas defensores de los derechos humanos ante la nbsp existencia de presos pol ticos y de conciencia del pa s condenados a penas y tratos inhumanos en c rceles de exterminio ante la pr ctica fascista de la desaparici n forzada de luchadores sociales ante la pretensi n del gobierno calderonista de mantener en calidad de detenidos desaparecidos a nuestros camaradas edmundo reyes amaya y gabriel alberto cruz s nchez

7946937 there is so called third party content on web sites some of which can gather data about how you browse the web how do you know what that is or how to control it
7946938 the only way to ensure that your data is not disclosed is to block content and prevent communication
7946939 i think that with regard to anything that has to do with consumers perceiving that their privacy is being invaded the marketer or the organization is going to suffer
7946940 most consumers are extremely uncomfortable with data being collected about them when they dont know its being done or for what purpose
7946941 look its the users computer users should have the right to make those decisions
7946942 if the user wants to block advertising they certainly should have the right to do so
7946943 the problem with privacy features that are developed for browser software is they typically require users to make a lot of decisions and stay on top of add ons for example in firefox so we would prefer to see a strong privacy safeguard technique built into the browser and thats what microsoft seems to have done here

7946973 in products from sunscreen to industrial coatings consumers are seeing the benefits of products built with materials measured in billionths of a meter nanotechnology offers vast promise and commercial opportunities opportunity however goes hand in hand with risk
7946974 nanotechnology adds an entirely new and largely unexplored realm of risks spread across the entire spectrum of modern commerce these emerging risks require a sophisticated approach by risk managers and businesses these risks carry with them the potential for far reaching effects on market cycles manufacturing and the safety security and well being of consumers the task of identifying these risks is complicated by the fact that scientists are still discovering how nanoparticles perform in manufactured products and how they react with humans and the environment
7946975 in addition corporate risk managers may not have recognized yet the role that nanotechnology is already playing or will be playing in their own businesses as nanotechnology plays a growing role in commerce insurers and underwriters will be increasingly taking these risks into account risk managers and insurers should strive to keep ahead of the issue of risk identification as nanotechnology makes its impact felt in the manufacturing legislative regulatory and legal arenas as well as in the realm of insurance underwriting

7946994 maar in deze situatie ligt de bal in het kamp van de europeanen
7946995 indien zij europa een verslechtering willen van de relaties dan zullen zij die uiteraard krijgen
7946996 maar als zij strategische relaties willen behouden wat helemaal in het belang is van zowel rusland als europa dan zal alles goed gaan

7947003 met de erkenning van de separatistische georgische deelrepublieken zuid osseti en abchazi wil rusland
7947004 het is de eerste poging sinds de tweede wereldoorlog om de europese grenzen met geweld te wijzigen
7947005 we zullen onze strijd voorzetten om onze territoriale integriteit op vreedzame wijze te herstellen er is geen twijfel mogelijk dat georgi n en onverdeeld zal zijn we gaan het kwaad overwinnen
7947006 onaanvaardbare daad waarvoor geen internationale juridische basis bestaat die het principe van de territoriale integriteit van georgi schendt en die indruist tegen alle internationale principes vn resoluties en de helsinki final act
7947007 is van oordeel dat rusland hiermee een vergissing begaat omdat het een gevaarlijk precedent schept en op termijn de stabiliteit in de regio en in europa in gevaar dreigt te brengen stabiliteit waarvoor de eu en rusland de gezamenlijke verantwoordelijkheid dragen
7947008 met de huidige crisis werd het noodzakelijk om een beslissing te nemen
7947009 rekening houdend met de vrije uiting van de wil van de ossetische en abchazische volkeren en geleid door het vn handvest en andere elementaire internationale wetgeving heb ik een resolutie getekend met de erkenning van abchazi en zuid ossetti
7947010 in de nacht van 8 augustus had tbilisi een keuze saakasjvili koos voor genocide met deze keuze vernietigde saakasjvili alle hoop voor een vreedzame co xistentie van zuid osseti en abchazi onder een regering
7947011 de evidente russische intentie om twee zones te erkennen twee regios die in een conflict verwikkeld geweest zijn en die zich manifest binnen de georgische landsgrenzen bevinden die door verschillende resoluties erkend zijn door de verenigde naties lijkt me betreurenswaardig

7947050 the time for the department of homeland security dhs to scrap their current approach to airline security is well overdue now that the terrorist screening centers terrorist watch lists have passed one million entries
7947051 the american people would be comforted if our presidential candidates denounced these burdensome practices senators mccain and obama should declare a moratorium on the use of the lists unless drastic measures are taken to improve their accuracy and protect innocent americans hoping to travel without burden
7947052 watch list systems are worse than worthless they create security risks by diverting scarce homeland security resources away from actual terrorists by focusing attention on hundreds of thousands if not millions of innocent travelers those innocent victims wrongly caught in the dragnet of suspicion are left without recourse to clear their good name upon completion of the investigation that uncovered all these deficiencies congress should publish all findings and recommend that dhs approach airline security in a manner that is both effective for our nations security and respects the freedom and liberty of innocent travelers

7947115 i came home one day from work and i was used to being really tense
7947116 so many other consultancies were engaged looking at major changes within the organization we found that most of them were inexperienced in saas and were asking us to help them in their evaluations we thought that we might as well be the company involved in the consultancy process as that would give our customers fewer firms to deal with
7947117 weve become a european partner for google apps we see this as a very good fit with salesforce google is committing a lot of resources to the launch of google apps and were getting in at the very start

7947127 there are no blue nor red states just united states
7947128 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in the eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
7947129 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
7947130 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
7947131 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
7947132 our findings may change the way some plastic surgeons treat baggy eyes
7947133 our study showed that a component of a patients blepharoplasty procedure should almost routinely involve fat excision rather than these procedures
7947134 although baggy lower eyelids are a significant result of aging and fat expansion there are other factors that can contribute too
7947135 we recommend that surgeons evaluate each component and address them accordingly in an individualized approach to blepharoplasty

7947152 while something as little as a name on a sign should not generate a strong community reaction the councils recent action of erecting a sign near wauchope referring to timbertown as an attraction of
7947153 wauchope people get very upset wauchope didnt want the amalgamation of the councils in 1981 because they knew everything would go to port and they were pretty right
7947154 theres been quite a bit of angst over this sign timbertown is a wholly wauchope local thing
7947155 locals put a lot of blood sweat and tears into getting timbertown started and keeping it going and i think when the sign went up people thought well thats just typical
7947156 i reckon the administrators decision is the correct one after all timbertown is in wauchope
7947157 it was an arrogant person who did that how dare they when timbertown is not in port macquarie
7947158 its not just a sign people in wauchope consider timbertown their attraction there is a lot of community pride attached to timbertown and that sign was seen as an assault on that pride
7947159 whilst i acknowledge greater port macquarie is used for tourism destination marketing in this instance i dont believe it was appropriate
7947160 the frustrated nurses said that due to the limited space and overcrowding the presentation of two mental health patients at any one time results in major problems for the emergency department
7947161 whist the nsw department of health suggests that the express community care centre eccc is trying to alleviate the pressures on staff and the public the fact remains that all patients must be triaged and prioritised before being directed to the appropriate area
7947162 its a serious situation its just all getting to the point where it cant go too much further before there are serious consequences
7947163 it was a split second difference between that being a fatality or another person being involved and killed
7947164 there was more chance of him being killed in that than winning the lotto
7947165 he was overtaking a line of traffic heading east and going around a right hand bend when he lost control
7947166 then he came back onto the road and over corrected causing the vehicle to spin and slide at a 90 degree angle across the lanes
7947167 without even knowing it he is an inspiration to so many people and to be able to help him out on such an enormous stage is the least we can do
7947168 the fact i didnt get one knock back shows just how inspirational ryley is to our community
7947169 he might play a sport otherwise known as murderball but this is an acknowledgement of his sportsmanship and his outstanding character
7947170 we wish him well and without putting too much pressure on him everyones best wishes will travel with him

7947177 its a great opportunity for us to start moving forward and start to put some good practices in place
7947178 one of the things coming to a place like this is i have an eagerness i havent had for quite a few years
7947179 with that will come a bit of excitement about learning about a place and its people and being able to really get my teeth into something brand new
7947180 this situation forced us to withdraw our support and sit on opposition benches

7947190 the young man had spent about five weeks in hastings and was due to return home next weekend his death is incredibly sad
7947191 enormous numbers of foreign students come to hastings and rother each summer in the region of 30 000 to 50 000
7947192 the problems and issues they are involved in are very few in comparison to these large numbers
7947193 notwithstanding this no matter how rare an incident like this is the effect on the young mans family can only be imagined
7947194 i saw the english boys attack the arab boys in the street
7947195 i have been told that they punched him he fell down then they kicked him in the head
7947196 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
7947197 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7947198 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
7947199 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
7947200 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
7947201 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this

7947277 the reports a good tool to demonstrate to people in an objective way how important programs like head start and early head start are in helping kids get on the right path

7947303 we take customer privacy and data security very seriously this incident is extremely regrettable and were taking every possible step to retrieve the data and ensure this is an isolated incident
7947304 it is essential that companies have appropriate procedures in place to ensure that personal records are kept secure at all times the ico said in a statement
7947305 if companies are disposing of computer equipment they must take the necessary steps to ensure that any personal information stored on the hard drive is rendered unrecoverable we are now investigating this potential data breach and will be seeking an urgent explanation from graphic data to establish what has gone wrong and the steps that are being taken to prevent a similar incident occurring

7947337 i was told all along that if something were to happen that this is a position i could find myself in
7947338 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all
7947339 we are going to go forward with the players that we have
7947340 and we are always looking for and searching for people who can help our team and nothing is going to change with regard to that
7947341 i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7947342 wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend
7947343 as i know it he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
7947344 he has not been bouncing back and forth like favre
7947345 he has been pretty happy we saw him up here and he said he missed it but he was content he has decided to go on to the next phase of his life so i dont look too strongly into that him playing again
7947346 it is something that he all of us really wanted but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back
7947347 it is a good thing for him it is a good thing for this team he is definitely a d lineman at heart and hopefully he can just come back in and not miss a beat
7947348 no more tea trolley no more snack attack in the afternoon
7947349 we did not play well as a team everybody knows that and william is no more guilty than anybody else
7947350 when you have an away game it can happen that you are caught for 20 or 30 minutes but i know my squad is good my team is good our spirit is good we are intelligent enough to know we did not play well but we know as well we have the needed quality to respond
7947351 your desire is to play well and win no matter how much experience you have if you dont play well you have more chances to lose than to win

7947369 haunting melodies and bittersweet lyrics that are soulful and insightful
7947370 thats a good question and it should be a simple one
7947371 obviously the war is a very important issue to me we need to get our troops home and we need to get them home now my own personal feelings about it is when the world is kind of perfect and we have those two things when were at peace and everybody has a good job although we should be working on these at the same time i dont mean to imply otherwise im really a big advocate for health care and of course my heart lies with education
7947372 i was kind of afraid of obama the first time i saw him
7947373 i think that not only can barack cause change because thats where his heart lies as a true american success story he understands how hard it is
7947374 he inspires us to be the best americans we can be and i think if hes president when hes president i should say were going to find people changing on the inside and once we all have hope for the future i think youre going to find everyones going to wake up and take control of this amazing moment where theres so many things that need help and people will all be inspired to help
7947375 i think the entertainment industry has all good intentions when we try to come out the thing that is unfortunate is that some of us who are maybe a little recognizable weve got to come out as private citizens and support our country in any way that we can
7947376 kate and her attorneys are only just learning of the complaint as kate has not yet been served

7947398 pacific film archive and the bancroft library create the film arts foundation collection
7947399 when youre doing any sort of biography its kind of difficult to veer too much off the path of the traditional music documentary
7947400 that said weve been focused on making this film not a vh 1 behind the music doc but something along the lines of crumb a portrait of the artist with their own quirky sensibility
7947401 these young kids met up in junior high school a product of this desegregation effort in l a in the late 70s
7947402 six young black kids from south central bused out to the white valley when they were on the cusp of making it big one of the kids left the band they suspected he had joined a cult so they kidnapped him and wanted to bring him in for a psychological examination but they were faced with kidnapping charges
7947403 the thing that really drew me was outsiders that didnt really fit in with their own community but also didnt fit with the predominantly white music industry
7947404 theres a sizable fishbone fan base out there and we want them to be happy with the film
7947405 but really to make the best film we cant consider the fan base were making the film for someone whos never heard of fishbone and never wanted to see a music doc ever in their lives maybe never wanted to see a documentary in their lives if we can get a poster or a trailer in front of them theyll be grabbed by the story of two guys and their struggle to make it
7947406 it kind of reinforces the sort of things weve already known to protect your individuality keep on taking your own path in life instead of the paths society provides for you making documentaries isnt fiscally prudent but looking at angelo and nor you always figure a way to get it done and the importance of building a fan base whether youre making music or films
7947407 what happened was i had just gotten married for the second time and i wanted to do a better job in my second marriage then i did on my first
7947408 i thought a great way to do that was to talk to people whod done it right and had made their marriages last longer than i had the first time around
7947409 now the collapse of the marriage has become part of the film
7947410 and a vehicle for telling my story and how my thought process has changed throughout the making of the film im using my story as an engine thats driving the film at this point it started as a search for the secret to a long lasting marriage and shifted to why do we marry what drives us to marry when we have only a 50 percent chance of success what are we gaining from marriage and particularly what are women gaining
7947411 the irony of the second marriage breaking up is too ridiculous so i do have to laugh at this point
7947412 suggested that people not get married and just find someone they want to raise children with then raise them like divorced people do living separately so youre starting the marriage the way 50 percent of couples will end up but without the animosity
7947413 it definitely gives you a sense of what hes seen he was one of the most cynical people ive interviewed
7947414 when harry met sally is in my mind of course those compositions were taken from scenes from a marriage

7947418 a number of ingredients can provide uva protection including avobenzone and the recently approved mexoryl to say there is no protection against uva is misleading the consumer
7947419 bringing a new active ingredient to market is a very intensive process in europe and the united states
7947420 uva penetrates much deeper and doesnt produce the same visible sunburn effects
7947421 if you are going to measure how well you are being protected you have to decide on a marker or indicator of damage the methods are still evolving and this is one of the reasons why the fda has deferred

7947426 saya ingin menang saya ingat terakhir kali kami pergi ke sana kami hanya punya setengah kekuatan karena pada seninnya kami harus bermain di liga melawan newcastle
7947427 ketika saya melihat lazio merayakan kemenangan di akhir pertandingan rasanya mereka seperti baru saja memenangi piala dunia saya tidak senang saya berpikir bahwa hal itu tidak boleh terulang lagi
7947428 kami sudah dua kali memberi piala super buat inter meskipun yang pertama di tahun 2006 lebih dramatis karena kami membuang keunggulan 3 0 menjadi kalah 3 4
7947429 sangat memalukan gagal penalti seperti itu karena ini semua terlihat seperti piala dunia 2006 melawan australia
7947430 aku masuk sebagai pengganti dan menghadapi sebuah penalti yang bisa menentukan semuanya laksana tertulis buatku seperti sebuah film aku ribuan pikiran di kepalaku apakah aku harus mengubah arah tendangan dari yang biasa aku lakukan
7947431 aku bertanya pada diri sendiri menendang dengan kaki dalam tapi tidak sekencang kencangnya tapi malah terlalu tinggi
7947432 ini menyedihkan karena aku sudah menyiapkan seratus dedikasi dan selebrasi
7947433 i didnt expect one to go up where it has gone up there are people watching me coming and going outside my house

7947440 the fact that there are nine western warships in the black sea cannot but be a cause for concern they include two us warships one each from spain and poland and four from turkey

7947456 zipcar offers a wonderful way for bowdoin students faculty and staff to take cars off the road and reduce our carbon footprint
7947457 beginning with the class of 2013 first year students will no longer be able to have cars on campus and zipcar will provide an inexpensive and convenient alternative for them and for our upper class students faculty and staff thanks to zipcar over time i expect well see fewer students with cars and more one car families
7947458 this is just one more in a long list of initiatives that colby has undertaken to reduce our carbon footprint
7947459 the zipcars allow students with cars to leave them at home if they want and it adds a transportation option for those who dont have cars its an all around good idea
7947460 the partnership with zipcar will help us further our commitment to reduce our carbon footprint and create a culture that supports sound creative transportation alternatives for our students faculty and staff
7947461 we are delighted that this convenient economical and environmentally friendly option is now available on campus to the university community and area residents
7947462 these students have a very mature understanding of fashion and they can track their influences to specific collections of the worlds top designers they are incredibly focused on their goals and we hope to give them an amazing experience at galleria dallas

7947500 saakashvili chose genocide to solve his political tasks the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have more than once spoken in referenda supporting the independence of their republics we understand that after what had happened they have the right to decide their fate themselves
7947501 were not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
7947502 of course we dont need that everything depends on the stance of our partners and the world community and our partners in the west
7947503 todays announcement further inflames an already tense situation in the region
7947504 we fully support georgias independence and territorial integrity which cannot be changed by decree from moscow we again call on russia to abide by international law as the basis for resolving this crisis and to implement urgently and in full russias commitments to withdraw forces
7947505 i dont think we should really be afraid of isolation
7947506 i dont think isolation is looming i dont believe this should really be a doomsday scenario i believe common sense should prevail
7947507 some people in the west have been in denial for a long time
7947508 now there can be no more denial the west has to show that this will cost them really cost them you are dealing with bullies here and bullies do not understand the tender message

7947514 if i were this old man mugabe the events of this week would have convinced me that at 84 years old its now time to ride into the sunset and never re appear on the political scene again
7947515 many of us ruling party mps realise that fact and we will be aligning with the opposition
7947516 ainda n o caiu a ficha sobre a conquista eu andava com a medalha para todos os lugares procurava n o ficar sozinha porque sen o eu chorava e tamb m tentava n o dormir com medo de que minha conquista fosse apenas um sonho

7947522 after 18 months in government the snp are riding high theyre popular but heres my prediction by 2010 they wont be
7947523 you can already see the underlying weaknesses that will undo alex salmond what looks like confidence surefooted and wily today will seem arrogant misguided and politically dishonest tomorrow spin is the hallmark of this government but spin has a shelf life
7947524 he will bring energy and enthusiasm to the role taking the fight to the snp and labour right across scotland
7947525 tavish will address the issues that matter most to the people of scotland not the narrow minded squabbles of the nationalists and labour
7947526 viewers were disgusted that a mother of two young girls would use such foul language
7947527 we know people need to be given a reason why they should change
7947528 they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change
7947529 if youre out there live at 2008 democratic national convention
7947530 foreign minister and new zealand first leader winston peters may face a political crisis after a meeting this morning of the privileges committee to discuss a statement from billionaire owen glenn about a donation the committee is conducting an inquiry into a 100 000 donation from mr glenn in 2005 that went to mr peters legal fees for the tauranga electoral challenge mr peters has assured prime minister helen clark he found out about the payment only on july 18 this year after his lawyer brian henry told him if mr glenns statement says that he discussed the donation with mr peters then the ministers credibility will be seriously challenged
7947531 in late july we start getting calls and answering questions online having to do with back to school time particularly on the subject of starting back to secondary school
7947532 kids who have just finished primary school are apprehensive about secondary school they have preconceived ideas about gangs drugs and the workload they often feel uprooted faced with leaving their old friends behind going to a new neighbourhood and meeting new teachers
7947533 going to school for some kids also means falling back into the daily trials and tribulations of bullying or scholastic failure when these students call us they are already discouraged and anxious before theyve even gone back for the first day of school
7947534 they have a very negative image of school our job is to provide them with suggestions for solutions to help them to change their situation and in this way to start the school year on a new positive footing
7947535 listen i have a huge problem i dont want to go to secondary school i cry every day i want to stay in grade 8 with my younger friends i dont want to go into grade 9 how can i fit in what can i do im tired of crying but i dont want to go to secondary school i throw fits even though i know that wont do a thing to change my situation unfortunately i have to keep going to school
7947536 the basic problem that we all face nowadays is how to handle vast amounts of information at a sensible rate
7947537 the first idea of building the semantic desktop arose from the fact that one of our colleagues could not remember the girlfriends of his friends
7947538 because they kept changing you know how it is the point is you have a vast amount of information on your desktop hidden in files hidden in emails hidden in the names and structures of your folders nepomuk gives a standard way to handle such information
7947539 in terms of usability and public impact it is of great interest
7947540 workspaces that connect to other workspaces and help you in your day to day activities of collecting information structuring it making sense of it and creating new information and communicating it
7947541 but not much for the users eye so far we only use it for tags ratings and comments as well as metadata cached from files for fast searches in 4 1 you only see the tagging and rating interfaces in apps like dolphin or gwenview
7947542 experimental tools exist that allow you to relate people to files pictures for example or other people or to tag web sites but in the future neomuk is supposed to be combined with way more applications important of course are the kde pim applications such as kmail and kaddressbook kmail developers for example have plans to provide virtual email folders through nepomuk also a service will extract contacts from kde pim and link them to emails im accounts and dates and thus provide an abstract view of the people you know

7947693 the absence of a national health act to back up the national health policy has been a fundamental weakness which needed to be tackled frontally this weakness means that there is no health legislation describing the national health system and defining the roles and responsibilities of the three tiers of government and other stakeholders in the system this has led to confusion duplication of functions and sometimes lapses in the performance of essential public health functions

7947730 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in the eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
7947731 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
7947732 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
7947733 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
7947734 our findings may change the way some plastic surgeons treat baggy eyes
7947735 our study showed that a component of a patients blepharoplasty procedure should almost routinely involve fat excision rather than these procedures
7947736 although baggy lower eyelids are a significant result of aging and fat expansion there are other factors that can contribute too
7947737 we recommend that surgeons evaluate each component and address them accordingly in an individualized approach to blepharoplasty

7947767 what a high relationship is that of a son to his father
7947768 behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not
7947769 see how i am arrayed my graces are not bright my righteousness does not shine with apparent glory
7947770 it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him

7947778 little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous
7947779 he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil
7947780 he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil
7947781 whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god
7947782 in this the children of god are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god neither he that loveth not his brother

7947892 the basic problem that we all face nowadays is how to handle vast amounts of information at a sensible rate
7947893 the first idea of building the semantic desktop arose from the fact that one of our colleagues could not remember the girlfriends of his friends
7947894 because they kept changing you know how it is the point is you have a vast amount of information on your desktop hidden in files hidden in emails hidden in the names and structures of your folders nepomuk gives a standard way to handle such information
7947895 in terms of usability and public impact it is of great interest
7947896 workspaces that connect to other workspaces and help you in your day to day activities of collecting information structuring it making sense of it and creating new information and communicating it
7947897 but not much for the users eye so far we only use it for tags ratings and comments as well as metadata cached from files for fast searches in 4 1 you only see the tagging and rating interfaces in apps like dolphin or gwenview
7947898 experimental tools exist that allow you to relate people to files pictures for example or other people or to tag web sites but in the future neomuk is supposed to be combined with way more applications important of course are the kde pim applications such as kmail and kaddressbook kmail developers for example have plans to provide virtual email folders through nepomuk also a service will extract contacts from kde pim and link them to emails im accounts and dates and thus provide an abstract view of the people you know
7947899 there should be no distinction for you between an email address and an im account
7947900 there are so many ideas in my head and not only in mine
7947901 so its an end in itself certainly it offers new ways of building applications and we certainly hope that will fly
7947902 because it provides an environment that makes it easy to annotate your information and because it helps you in maintaining your information which means we have a very personal motivation to annotate your information and then we have the initial starting point
7947903 this is just my policy but i dont want to give an exclusive character for any particular console
7947904 he must have jimmied his door so that when the guard came by that night and gave it a tug she though it was locked
7947905 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
7947906 the opposition parties have been threatening and or demanding an election for some time so i think if that is eventually where we have to go i dont think they will at this point be able to say theyre the least bit surprised
7947907 the ongoing controversy has impaired the ability of current leadership to perform effectively as a result the united way of central carolinas has decided to end ms kings employment and bring in new leadership
7947908 good lord there is such power in that panel discussion room and its maybe the most discerning audience ive ever seen
7947909 people know the most obscure things youve done they talk about themes and is it 75 of the movies in the theater are now based on comics books maybe more its fantastic
7947910 really though i was surprised they asked me to be a regular on the show i wouldnt think a terminators life would be that long so whichever way it goes its okay with me
7947911 i enjoy so much playing him in fact more then i thought i would
7947912 i thought it would be very finite the things i could do but then you realize how not that anyone loves him but you love the machines and how you cant part with them its weird its like aww i cant sell my nova you know all the stuff ive been through with this car and i kind of feel like that you find these little individual tics even in the biggest piece of machinery i am enjoying that part of finding the way he has no hesitation he is socially unskilled he says hello a little too hard smiles a little too big
7947913 i like the original notion for the terminators that i think even james cameron had that they should really blend in
7947914 they need to blend and while he doesnt totally blend in ive based my whole career in trying to disappear into different kinds of characters i like doing something different than the last one i did and how cool then to play a character that can become whatever he needs to get his job done so im just kind of letting it be that the hardest part for me is trying to divorce my performance from any sort of feelings you realize how much you pile on as an actor like oh hes probably scared here or oh maybe he doesnt want to jump into the pit of swirling knives but cromartie will be like john connors in there ill jump in there no fear no hesitation i kind of think of jason bourne more than terminators you know what i mean i just like that i wish i was like that in my life
7947915 as often as id seen the terminator movies you forget things
7947916 i remembered that one section where i think kyle reese was yelling at linda hamilton about they have hair they sweat they have bad breath that whole thing i was like oh yeah they sweat and can have bad breath maybe we dont need to be so worried about my armpits or whatever id also forgotten how in terminator 2 arnold kind of got all philosophical and he would talk about histories of things and weapons
7947917 ive been beat up so much in my career its so nice to win and break a neck im anxious to punch something actually i havent punched anything as a terminator yet its all lifting people by their necks but actually just a good ole terminator punch would be exciting right

7947920 we have clear evidence of organisations which used to be funded and have delivered on outcomes but have suddenly not been supported
7947921 and we have to ask the question whether there seems to be an acceptance that if another black youth is killed they are just another one that we dont have to worry about
7947922 black youths within this country have been left to die and thats a very strong statement but its a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed

7947961 and then theres the movie universe and then theres the webisodes and theyre all related
7947962 its like radio shows the way they used to do and it makes complete sense to me this form gives us a lot of freedom
7947963 i talked the story through with the guys at fearnet
7947964 and they scripted it i gave them my notes and made them change a few things and director ben ketai took it from there
7947965 weve all learned how much story you can tell in seven and a half minutes

7947985 weve always had a policy for dealing with domestic violence but no detail on how to implement it which meant it was difficult for us to respond to this crime consistently across our organisation
7947986 at its core this is all about saving lives and giving staff the ability to recognise the signs that someone is suffering from domestic abuse and what they can do to help them
7947987 we need to get staff to think about things other than rent arrears or taking action against people for anti social behaviour and that things may not always be as black and white as first seems
7947988 its also about giving residents the correct support helping them to get out of an abusive relationship if they want to and knowing who they can go to for more advice
7947989 this toolkit will mean that our housing staff have the resources at their fingertips to be able to help survivors of domestic abuse at the first crucial point when they decide that enough is enough and that they need to tell someone what is happening to them
7947990 staff can provide advice on what other options are available to them we can offer support and advice and help them make a decision about whether they want to leave the relationship and can give them protection if they do make the decision to leave
7947991 we can also help with emergency accommodation if the person feels they will not be safe if they remain at home
7947992 this is our commitment to dealing with domestic abuse since november when we started recording incidents we have added 31 cases to the file
7947993 a large organisation like merlin with such direct links with communities and residents will provide an ideal mechanism for helping to increase reporting by identifying and supporting victims
7947994 this is an important milestone for partnership working to tackle domestic violence not just for south gloucestershire but as a blueprint for the south west region
7947995 the programme aims to stop domestic abuse before it starts and prevent situations from getting out of control
7947996 this will provide an opportunity for men to think about their abusive behaviour and the impact this has on their partner and any children
7947997 we honor the central place of faith in our lives like our founders we believe that our nation our communities and our lives are made vastly stronger and richer by faith
7947998 it is frustrating when we have to move them on
7947999 many of them have children family friends and a support network here in loughborough it is difficult enough for them to come to terms with what has happened
7948000 we would like a two year tenancy which would give the local authority enough time to find them a home or enough time for them to look at private renting
7948001 following consultation womens aid is listed as key partner in several of the actions in the action plan
7948002 these include promoting monitoring and further developing the sanctuary scheme for victims of domestic violence which enables victims to remain in their own homes where they choose to do so
7948003 they will also look to develop improved alternative temporary accommodation for homeless households with an output being to develop an increased number of refuge spaces in line with government guidance
7948004 at this time of year with many opportunities to engage in summer drinking at private barbecues or at public houses relationships can suffer due to changes in behaviour driven by excessive consumption of alcohol
7948005 this campaign is about raising awareness and building a picture of inappropriate behaviour so that people can have the chance to check and regulate their conduct we are appealing to perpetrators of domestic violence to take responsibility for managing their behaviour and seek the advice and support they need
7948006 its 3 a m and your children are safe and asleep who do you want answering the phone

7948036 the traditional media do a lot of things wrong we want them to do things correctly we want them to do their job
7948037 were seeing how incredibly powerful it is to assemble the networks and the globosphere it literally has its own gravitational pull there are so many millions of readers
7948038 we usually work in isolation its not like a newsroom where youre working with your colleagues were in isolation and every once in awhile we get to come together and share in a big experience and i wouldnt miss it for the world it feels part of a broader movement and we need that affirmation
7948039 the bottom line is that people no longer want to be spectators technology allows us to essentially become participants

7948063 on april 15 2008 it had been decided that the next step would require revisiting the massage parlors secretly introducing tape recorders and tape recording the sex acts
7948064 it was also decided that in order not to cause breiner to be assigned to engage in multiple sex acts required to make a felony charge a second officer would be enlisted which led to the involvement of lt david kiker in the operation

7948068 binayak is a very rare doctor a man with a deep understanding of the social and political dimensions of health the governments of the world the world bank and other organisations are now worrying about food security and alternative food policies binayak was decades ahead of them all
7948069 he is a maoist leader and sympathiser and we have enough evidence against him
7948070 these settlements are supposed to be the nail in the coffin of any future peace agreement with the palestinians
7948071 this place is holy to the jewish people and we have a duty to be here
7948072 the whole land of israel belongs to us and we should not be afraid to live wherever we want to the arabs must accept that
7948073 we are connected to the water grid we have phone lines from the national company bezeq we have been hooked up by the electricity company and have street lighting
7948074 we also have a kindergarten paid for by the state and a group of soldiers stationed here to protect us how can we be illegal
7948075 we can also see all the arabs from here and keep an eye on what they are doing
7948076 and in addition we can see the other settlements and check on their safety
7948077 they are very afraid that this will become simply the first of many settlements to fall
7948078 the settlers know that preparation of an alternative site could take years
7948079 the danger is that migron will be destroyed only to be resurrected in legalised form by the government as a new settlement close by adam
7948080 we believe it is possible to find a solution for the outposts that will strengthen the settlements
7948081 it would be a big mistake if we give up what is rightfully ours
7948082 abandonment of the 1970s where entire blocks are stripped is what this will look like
7948083 how in the world does the mayor justify what hes trying to do
7948084 76 people all civilians and most of them women and children were martyred 19 women 7 men and the rest children all under 15 years of age
7948085 martyring at least 70 people most of them women and children
7948086 we couldnt and we havent found any identification showing they are taliban
7948087 the people were very angry they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes we want our children we want our relatives can you give it to us you cannot so go away
7948088 we went to the area and found out that the bombardment was very heavy lots of houses have been damaged and more than 90 non combatants including women children and elderly people have died most are women and children they the us military have claimed that taliban were there they must prove it so far it is not clear for us why the coalition conducted the air strikes
7948089 these reports are being investigated and well look for the results of that investigation
7948090 coalition forces take precautions to prevent the loss of civilians unlike the taliban and militants who target civilians and place civilians in harms way
7948091 was aware of allegations that the engagement in shindand district of herat province friday may have resulted in civilian deaths
7948092 the afghan pakistan war is a two country war that cannot be won in afghanistan alone at this point in time us nato isaf afghan forces are simply too weak to deal with a multi faceted insurgency with a de facto sanctuary along the entire afghan pakistan border it seems likely that the afghan pakistan war will play out over a decade or more and be a major problem for the entire term of office for the next presidents of both the us and pakistan
7948093 the us and its allies have no choice other than to try and force pakistans new government to take a far firmer and aggressive stand decisions to take decisive action will be pakistani but the us should make it openly clear that the us cannot wait for pakistan to make such decisions and will have to treat pakistani territory as a combat zone if pakistan does not act
7948094 the new security plan should also include shia cities like hwaider khirnabat and abara
7948095 the forces of the new security plan took all our weapons to the extent that we cannot fight al qaeda any more we are impotent
7948096 no shia vip or layman has been arrested since the launch of the security plan
7948097 we all know that shia militias in baquba are a source of instability
7948098 influential shia members in the provincial office or in the ruling council were behind the bad security situation in this province it cannot be that all of them are innocent
7948099 the people of santa cruz should rest assured that we will stop any minister arriving in santa cruz because they are not welcome
7948100 the political effects of a radicalised position are not yet visible but they could be tremendously adverse for santa cruz
7948101 we are no longer just a simple government but rather the power of the people
7948102 the debate on the referendum must not last beyond next week
7948103 if its through a law its a law if its by decree its a decree the new constitution has to be approved and we will ensure it is approved
7948104 if some groups do not want to understand the overwhelming sentiment of bolivian people the thoughts and suffering of the majorities then surely they will continue to reduce more and more in numbers and become more violent we have an obligation to ensure order so that there is respect between bolivians
7948105 we will not allow more outrages upon our institution and much less attacks on police officers
7948106 w e havent been able to break their intellectual appeal that they seem to still have
7948107 large numbers of the intellectual elite and civil liberties bodies provide a backup to the movement in terms of agitprop and other activities
7948108 are still able to get support of intellectual classes is disturbing unless we can divorce the two defeating the maoists is not that easy
7948109 we have not seen any kind of infusion of arms or ammunition
7948110 educated elite that gives them a connection to the outside world
7948111 the corruption of truth the abandonment of the due process of law it is the use of the big lie and the unfounded accusation against any citizen in the name of americanism or security it is the rise to power of the demagogue who lives on untruth it is the spreading of fear and the destruction of faith in every level of society
7948112 found that many of the allegations against salwa judum were based on rumours and hearsay and devoid of facts again many of the villagers whose names figured in the column comprising victims of salwa judum or the security forces were actually found to have been killed by naxalites firs had been registered in most of these cases and the state government had also doled out compensation to relatives of those killed nhrc teams also discovered many of the villagers whose names figured in the list were actually naxalites who had been killed in encounters with the security forces a few other villagers were found to have died of natural causes while yet another group of villagers whose names figured in the list of dead were actually found to be alive
7948113 all that remains against the present applicant tahir is that he visited ahmedabad and had visited camps to identify the children so that they can be better looked after that by itself cannot be considered an offence
7948114 does rdx have a special stamp establishing its link to muslims
7948115 all muslims are not terrorists but all terrorists are muslims
7948116 i mean if javed akhtar and shabana azmi cannot get a flat in mumbai because they are muslims then what are we talking about
7948117 you cant only make token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows so what happened is token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed
7948118 thats why i am so distressed over what is happening in kashmir for heavens sake it should be brought to a stop and it should have been brought to a stop right when they started that nonsense
7948119 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be a very important part for the success of a democracy
7948120 i dont think that the muslim leadership has bothered to clear the air about what islam actually is
7948121 dwelt on one of the most troubled issues of our times the unthinking manner in which islam and terror are being linked

7948134 come molti economisti ha detto allagi phelps a margine del convegno su europa mutamenti climatici e politiche energetiche organizzato a monteporzio catone dalla fondazione economia tor vergata penso che quello che stiamo vivendo e un picco del prezzo del petrolio legato alla ricerca di un nuovo equilibrio
7948135 probabilmente ha aggiunto e vero che il prezzo del petrolio era un po troppo basso i mercati funzionano cosi non fanno grande attenzione al futuro piu immediato ma comincia ad esserci una rivalutazione del prezzo e un grosso spostamento verso il riassestamento del mercato a breve continua phelps potrebbe anche esserci il calo del prezzo del petrolio a 120 a 130 dollari oppure il rialzo ad 150 160 dollari in ogni caso il prezzo del petrolio non restera piatto e avra un trend verso lalto nei prossimi 10 20 30 anni adesso comunque ha concluso phelps quello del petrolio e il suo prezzo reale

7948201 thou shalt not hang on the rope and call it a free ascent except when youre working the route to get a free ascent
7948202 there is no doubt that if iris robinson had made those remarks about the black or the jewish community she would have been outed from public office and forced to resign
7948203 people would have said that such comments are totally unacceptable
7948204 the fact that many are making excuses for people saying that her conscience or religion gives her an excuse for making these remarks i find unconscionable
7948205 it is a great idea to have a 50m pool in the area
7948206 bristol really should have had a 50m pool 10 years ago
7948207 it has been a long time coming and hopefully it will attract bigger competitions and more swimming to the city
7948208 but the number of pools being built does not compensate for the number that have been shut down in recent years

7948230 the canadian economy likely managed to eke out a trace of growth in the second quarter just avoiding a second consecutive quarter of declining gdp and averting a technical recession for now
7948231 it now looks fairly clear that unlike quebec ontario will not be able to sidestep a recession
7948232 canadas six big banks report third quarter earnings and they are not expected to be pretty
7948233 to date canadian banks have announced approximately 10 billion in writedowns since last summers financial crisis began and while a third consecutive quarter of lower aggregate earnings appears to be a given it will be the magnitude of further writedowns that will be closely watched
7948234 would mark one of the largest nominal surpluses on record
7948235 while we may see a small gain in existing home sales in july as more foreclosed houses are put on the market at bargain prices new home sales are expected to fall in july
7948236 the gears of our capitalism are grinding to a halt
7948237 there is a tremendous concern over the banking sector and a scramble right now for capital
7948238 the credit crunch is only now beginning because bank capital is so constricted by losses to date that they will have to begin shutting off credit to households and corporations and thats when we get the defaults
7948239 we have taken several actions to enhance liquidity such as reducing the dividend expense reductions and a reduction in our balance sheet growth
7948240 they want to escape the pressure of the funding markets
7948241 they wanted to borrow the money at the cheapest levels possible and floating rate notes helped them achieve that
7948242 you cant build a banking business on short term funding
7948243 lending long and borrowing short is the classic mistake that led to all the big bank failures in the past
7948244 valuations in the residential credit sector continue to languish as concerns about forced asset sales from banks broker dealers and structured vehicles dominate
7948245 over the last several weeks weve fielded a number of calls from companies about their underwater options
7948246 they want to know what their choices are and what it will take to find a solution
7948247 from a morale standpoint and an employee retention standpoint this has become a serious issue for many companies where options dont appear as if theyll emerge anytime soon
7948248 in some ways they have lost the value of using company stock as a motivator for current workers
7948249 its a bear market and if you reprice the options now theres still a chance they could go underwater at some point in the future employees want something that has some value
7948250 if you jump ship to a competitor you can pick up new options that have lower prices and more upside
7948251 if your company isnt doing anything about underwater options you can do your own exchange
7948252 uk consumer spending looks very vulnerable and retrenchment could be both severe and long lived
7948253 how bad will the uk recession get its difficult to know the fact that excesses in the housing market and in consumer spending look as if they have far to unravel suggests that it is likely to continue well into 2009
7948254 the early 1980s recession saw the level of gdp fall 6pc from peak to trough while the early 1990s recession saw a 2 5pc fall in both cases once the gross domestic product stopped contracting it took more than a year before growth recovered to a trend pace or above
7948255 to businesses and consumers it could feel like a recession as their spending power will be constrained profits will shrink and unemployment will rise
7948256 even if we avoid a technical recession its going to feel pretty recession like with sharp rises in unemployment and falling real incomes
7948257 opinions differ even on the mpc as to whether such a rebalancing is necessary or whether the uk economy could go on relying on credit fuelled consumption for its gdp growth those who take the latter view advocate us style slashing of interest rates aimed at reviving the credit markets
7948258 we need to look seriously at how to modernize our regulatory structure
7948259 what we have learned from the past two years is that the old form of regulation is broken
7948260 the exact form of the reform is something that we are learning about
7948261 before we go to the conclusion that the fed should be the single regulator i believe personally that there was a significant failure of regulation by the federal reserve that was part of this crisis
7948262 there was no effort to take a rule we already have a regulation we already have to try to rein in the subprime market lending
7948263 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level
7948264 such an injection would effectively make the government an owner of the agencies without taking control of day to day operations
7948265 but to be clear an actual opinion would depend on all the information available at the time of a potential event
7948266 and it may be possible to obtain different or even opposite interpretations from different sources
7948267 they need to reassure investors by offloading some of these assets
7948268 theres no question that selling their troubled assets will help
7948269 but how much will it help were in tough times and it doesnt look like things are going to get any better any time soon
7948270 people inside the company are in open revolt while people outside are losing confidence in him
7948271 the quarter is almost over and he has failed to sell bad assets thats not acceptable
7948272 lehman needs to get out of the spotlight if its to survive
7948273 selling most of the bad assets and a big capital infusion might help them achieve that they need to do whatever it takes to stop being speculated about
7948274 the precise amount of losses that may be incurred on these securities for the third quarter is difficult to determine
7948275 worst case scenario is if the government wipes out all the common stock and preferred stock
7948276 the market is currently discounting the risk that something like that happens
7948277 we really hadnt gotten data out of the largest banks yet
7948278 it definitely worries me that perhaps theres more exposure at the large banks than we think
7948279 we would buy preferred stock subject to significant treasury participation and an attractive yield
7948280 it is a long term call on the common stock
7948281 without such a plan like this shareholders might get zero you want zero or ongoing companies
7948282 common holders will face dilution but it would be down the road with this plan
7948283 the equity is virtually worthless and will continue to be
7948284 if the treasury buys preferred stock though i would assume that would validate that class of equity during any liquidation reprivitization
7948285 the election season and the relatively recent passage of the treasury authorization argue for delay as long as possible
7948286 there is enormous uncertainty about where we stand at the moment
7948287 we are in the midst of the worst financial crisis since world war ii
7948288 in real economy terms we are not looking at anything exceptional
7948289 it is amazing a year later how much is still unresolved
7948290 china has used the pretext of reserve requirement hikes to help slow yuan appreciation we estimate that the pboc central bank intervened by about 49 6bn in june
7948291 they are now more worried about growth than overheating and you are seeing that play out in the currency markets there has been a remarkable change of view
7948292 during the first half of this year about 67 000 small and medium sized companies went bankrupt throughout china leaving more than 20m people out of work
7948293 bankruptcies of textile and spinning companies have numbered more than 10 000 two thirds are on the brink of bankruptcy
7948294 it is unrealistic to expect the government to rescue the market
7948295 speculators should be very cautious now the worst is not over in the global credit crisis
7948296 this measure will help ease the pressure placed on the market by state owned shares
7948297 investors sentiment is quite low and the government has been trying to bolster market confidence by limiting massive share sales
7948298 weve got our fingers crossed that things will improve but there is the recognition that there is still a long way to go yet
7948299 it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7948300 i hope the bank of england are doing more than cross their collective fingers
7948301 instead of suggesting and hinting that no bank would be allowed to fail they should do what they did in 1974 75 come out categorically and say no bank no creditors of any british bank will lose money full stop
7948302 some vulnerable citizens are going to need help for example when it comes to paying their fuel bills this winter
7948303 the worst way to approach this would be though an arbitrary and unfair tax raid that would jeopardise badly needed investment in our energy infrastructure in the years ahead
7948304 ministers need to focus their efforts on protecting those at greatest risk from the worsening economic situation that means greater support for people living under the threat of having their homes repossessed and helping the large number of vulnerable people who will be hit with huge energy bills this winter
7948305 its absolutely right that the corporations who are benefiting from that original investment and the later privatisation pay their fair share to society
7948306 the majority of my constituents would be very much in favour of this
7948307 the monthly numbers of approvals for house purchase levelled off in july it would however be premature to think that the housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low
7948308 in just 12 months this economic landslide has sent the consumer lending market into disarray
7948309 for those with perfect credit records its unlikely this will be an issue but for others it could be problematic
7948310 this crisis has another six to nine months to run
7948311 theyve been announcing losses of 9bn and then coming back and saying sorry guv i meant 12bn you cant keep doing that
7948312 theres been an impairment of capital in the global banking system
7948313 its the continuance of concerns not just over mortgage losses but the process of credit destruction that has been set off all around the world
7948314 with more bad news emerging on u s financial shares its natural to see the market here take a hit as well
7948315 continue to dampen the global economy over the next 24 months
7948316 real estate firm bankruptcies remain our biggest concern for regional bank credit costs
7948317 the sentiment here remains pretty bad because of the events in georgia
7948318 i signed decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia
7948319 this adds to the uncertainty of doing business in russia and so people are reducing their positions
7948320 it now seems like this conflict could go on for a prolonged period
7948321 with todays data the risk of a recession has increased
7948322 germany is no longer in a position to resist the downward spiral i cant even see the end of it
7948323 a serious german downturn would not bode well for the euro zone as a whole to put it mildly
7948324 in the current environment it would be better if they
7948325 its difficult to say whether the worst is behind us
7948326 i see a gradual weakening of the german economy but not a collapse
7948327 the airbag effect of lower oil prices and a weaker exchange rate hasnt kicked in
7948328 we see a recession risk of 70 percent this year
7948329 consumers are not interpreting the marked decrease in crude oil prices as an all clear signal when it comes to purchasing power
7948330 the last time the expectations index of ifo was this low the german economy fell into a sharp recession
7948331 a lot of it depends on wall street as to whether we have to file bankruptcy or not
7948332 my sympathies are not with wall street i think they realize now they are in a situation where the clock is ticking
7948333 since weve put that on a referendum it has accelerated i think were getting more of a representative view very few people are saying they dont want bankruptcy
7948334 are getting closer to the day when that final option will have to be examined and a decision made
7948335 i can imagine a situation where we cant go out to the bond market for several years for capital needs
7948336 strategy to get more concessions but i dont know if that is a winning strategy my position on that is very clear i am not in favor of bankruptcy in any way shape or form we can solve this problem short of that
7948337 i think we need to just keep our options open and just bring everybody back to the table
7948338 we have never said we wouldnt be serious about bankruptcy if we had to
7948339 its just a last resort effort if that happens there should be a united commission about that how thats going to play out i dont know
7948340 we do realize that there will be more failures but its something that we can manage
7948341 we have a pretty significant fund and we have the ability to replenish it
7948342 for a lot of banks the die has already been cast
7948343 the banking industry goes into this mess much stronger than it was
7948344 as the fdic incurs losses those losses will be passed back to the banking industry
7948345 we had one of the largest and certainly what we think will be one of the most expensive failures at the beginning of the cycle
7948346 although its going to be challenging its not going to be all that bad
7948347 if anyone has a deposit of less than 100 000 they can sleep as soundly as always
7948348 i was shocked that the fdic did not have indymac on its watch list until a month before
7948349 you may have an inexperienced team remember for the last 13 or 14 years the banking industry has been pretty benign
7948350 they knew their funds were insured they still lined up and took their money out
7948351 weve had three failures since indymac and they all went smoothly
7948352 i feel that we did recognize it and did what we could
7948353 theyve raised billions of dollars they said they didnt need to replace losses they said they didnt have
7948354 i dont want to coach only for two months a year at present i prefer to be active throughout the season said garcia reneses who is expected to take over at spanish club unicaja
7948355 in the face of the danger threatening haiti i ask national civil protection committees and our friends in international cooperation to help the government manage the risks and disasters
7948356 additional strengthening is possible before the center moves over land today some weakening is likely when gustav moves over haiti however restrengthening is forecast as the center approaches eastern cuba on wednesday
7948357 gustav continues to represent a potential threat to oil and gas installations in the gulf region and will be watched with vigilance
7948358 given the current track for gustav and the expectation that it might enter the gulf of mexico this weekend we are making logistical arrangements to evacuate staff who are not essential to production or drilling operations
7948359 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7948360 tonight when hillary clinton speaks she will be an articulate voice for the working men and women the middle class families that have been squeezed and she will make the case as she uniquely can for why barack obama is the right choice for the presidency
7948361 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7948362 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7948363 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7948364 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause
7948365 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7948366 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again
7948367 i will not resign i will stay to protect this country
7948368 police will take decisive action against the protesters government restraint is almost over
7948369 i ask all the protesters who have been blockading or occupying government offices that you still have a chance to withdraw and go back to your homes
7948370 we are not breaking any laws we came in here and rallied peacefully we will stay as long as we can
7948371 i will spend my whole night here i fear nothing i dont fear a clash with police because i know samak would not dare to do that
7948372 the military will not stage a coup detat the public must not panic and must carry on their daily lives the army will not get involved in politics
7948373 direct affront to the will of the people of zimbabwe
7948374 landmark agreements have been concluded with every expectation that everybody will sign up
7948375 the elections are now behind us now is the time for us to put zimbabwe first
7948376 food is their latest weapon in their regime change agenda
7948377 to a praiseworthy search for peace and greater amity for our nation
7948378 happily all political parties in the country have acknowledged culpability in this violence
7948379 for the avoidance of doubt the only person who can officially open parliament will be determined by the outcome of the on going dialogue
7948380 we will not attend we dont expect any member of the executive to address us until that dialogue has been concluded
7948381 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
7948382 unfortunately they were ignored also by nato and the un
7948383 this contradicts the principle of territorial integrity a principle based on the international law of nations and for this reason it is unacceptable
7948384 we consider that this is a regrettable decision and we reiterate our commitment to the territorial integrity of georgia
7948385 were bewildered at the extreme level of activity of nato naval forces in the black sea which continue to increase their numbers
7948386 i dont think we should really be afraid of isolation i dont think that we are in for any freezing of relations if all sides are guided by the interests of their countries
7948387 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7948388 this is a great day in the history of our country and our people
7948389 this decision has no legal force russia will face harsh political consequences from this
7948390 it seems last night there was a build up of security forces around the camp
7948391 the police force will remain in its place until it enters the camp to collect the stockpiled weapons and prevent the rebels from getting inside the camp
7948392 the situation is very bad the people are really suffering
7948393 the first impression i have is that the sudanese want peace of course it isnt easy certain events complicate the task enormously
7948394 the government of southern darfur is asking us to organise a meeting with idp representatives to find a lasting solution but in the meantime we have been encouraging the idps to surrender their weapons voluntarily
7948395 we need to do a better job taking care of our military
7948396 we have to remind ourselves we are cheerleaders for barack obama
7948397 i know there is issues in springfield cook county chicago washington d c united nations those issues will be decided after this convention lets keep everything out of this convention
7948398 too many of our blue collar americans too many of our union members they like this guy mccain they like him
7948399 this race is too close we should be so far out ahead we should be able to take a breath but im telling you we cant even breathe it is so close
7948400 not que el avi n no ten a fuerza cuando empez a elevarse
7948401 above all else we want a candidate with a relentless passion to succeed whatever the adversity
7948402 the type of person we will be looking for is someone whose cup is always half full never half empty someone who can laugh at themselves a strong team player who sees this as a lifetime opportunity and can tell a good joke to keep others spirits up
7948403 est virtualmente tomada porque estamos en una situaci n conflictiva de negociaci n y el objetivo es obtener la mayor cantidad de dinero posible a efectos de poder cancelar las indemnizaciones
7948404 s lo alcanzar para cubrir un 30 por ciento de lo que tienen que cobrar los trabajadores por lo que vamos continuar dentro del margen de negociaci n que nos queda
7948405 no salimos no satisfechos pero s convencidos de que esto es lo que hay y que dentro de todo recompensa bien lo que se hab a perdido en el curso de estos cinco meses por la inflaci n
7948406 logramos un incremento proporcional para que se tenga en cuenta la carrera administrativa que fue nuestra pr dica permanente adem s logramos una garant a m nima porque son los trabajadores de menos recursos los que m s sufren el proceso inflacionario
7948407 estar amos en un incremento que supera el 30 por ciento con lo cual aclar hoffman no es lo ptimo ni lo deseado pero de alguna manera recompone el salario en funci n de la inflaci n
7948408 ste es un logro tanto de ate como de upcn en el marco de la paritaria que ha permitido que tengamos esta mejora sin ning n costo hemos confiado en este mecanismo y hoy tenemos un principio de soluci n que los trabajadores seguramente recibir n con satisfacci n
7948409 esto nos parece muy bien para no tener que estar reclamando todo el tiempo esto nos parece muy positivo porque hablaremos de aumento de sueldos en 2009 y a mediados de ese a o sin reclamarlo vamos a estar revisando otra vez la pol tica salarial
7948410 estamos emitiendo las intimaciones y las multas econ micas correspondientes contempladas en la ordenanza n 11 468
7948411 este monto es mucho mayor al beneficio que pudieron haber obtenido por cobrar tarifa plana a los estudiantes universitarios
7948412 en caso de reiteraci n del incumplimiento de la ordenanza se emitir n las multas correspondientes pero con un valor mayor que la primera vez
7948413 algunas empresas tuvieron multas mayores porque reincidieron en negarse a cobrar el boleto estudiantil
7948414 objetivamente no hay ninguna relaci n sin embargo algunas empresas alegaron esa relaci n en una nota presentada a la municipalidad aunque no est fundado
7948415 its always a two edged sword when you deal with political spouses
7948416 in some cases you know they can lose votes for you
7948417 on the other hand though by bringing a spouse into political play it gives the voters another person to either like or dislike
7948418 i mean it seems more so like that down in the states its more about the pageantry and whose wife you know what theyre like or whatever but up here it just seems more or less that people are concerned with the platform the issues
7948419 but i did watch something on the news a couple weeks ago about it
7948420 michelle obama had a spread in people a couple of weeks ago so i read it
7948421 capables de toutes les formes de d ch ance pour satisfaire leurs d sirs et notamment de la prostitution

7948423 the reception went well and the people have welcomed me
7948424 but the main thing is to be on the pitch and show what i can do
7948425 since the departure of nicky shorey we have been looking to supplement the left hand side of our squad and the signing of chris armstrong has given is the opportunity to do that
7948426 i am happy about this move to southampton this will certainly give me a chance to play and i hope i can get some real attention there
7948427 the majority of our fans display exemplary behaviour which is extremely pleasing and i think deserves a huge amount of praise
7948428 it is disappointing when incidents like this occur and i am delighted to say that these occurrences are very rare these days
7948429 im happy to bring this to my family and everybody from canada so it was a great experience a little disappointing at first but now i appreciate it a lot
7948430 she did her best and you know theres london after
7948431 just watching her get her silver medal was something incredible because she is a little older than us and just being at the same games as her is something that we never would have thought would happen
7948432 just watching her event just going one dive at a time and nailing them one dive at a time we were almost crying at the end just being really happy seeing her get her individual medal
7948433 its great that they came here tonight because its really late and people have a lot of stuff to do so its awesome
7948434 its official barack obama has received no bounce in voter support out of his selection of sen joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate
7948435 the gallup daily tracking poll from aug 23 25 the first three day period falling entirely after obamas saturday morning vice presidential announcement shows 46 of national registered voters backing john mccain and 44 supporting obama not appreciably different from the previous weeks standing for both candidates this is the first time since obama clinched the nomination in early june though that mccain has held any kind of advantage over obama in gallup poll daily tracking
7948436 uniquely qualified to nudge the country toward the color purple
7948437 four more years of the same out of touch policies that created an economic disaster at home a disastrous foreign policy abroad four more years of the same divisive politics thats all about tearing people down instead of lifting the country up
7948438 we cant afford four more years of a government that does nothing while they watch the housing market collapse
7948439 the new law one of the most far reaching on housing in decades marks the centerpiece of washingtons efforts to address the nations housing meltdown
7948440 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night before you put the kids after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much youre worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at

7948466 i have sad news after 11 years we will be publishing a final 2008 issue of smartphone amp pocket pc magazine and then suspend publication we are working hard to make it the best windows mobile issue ever a keeper a reference guide it is with great regret i make this announcement we are a very small self funded magazine publishing company we did not make this decision lightly especially after 11 years of issues it has become harder and harder to grow our circulation over the past three years since windows mobile changed from being pdas to being phones pocket pc manufacturers like hp used to work with us to offer their customers a free issue of our magazine in their packaging the phone companies have not shown similar interest in working with us the other business challenge has been the lack of advertising sponsorship from microsoft phone companies and oems despite our coverage of their products in order for us to sell subscriptions at current low consumer magazine type prices we must have a stronger and growing circulation and we much attract the large advertisers who benefit the most from our existence of course the irony is that almost 20 million windows mobile units were sold this past microsoft fiscal year we think there is a great opportunity to continue the magazine in this high growth smartphone market for a more sophisticated publishing company or a funded entrepreneur

7948598 we passed three bonds and a parcel tax in an anti tax community
7948599 we were able to do it because we did huge oureach we wouldnt even discuss putting it on the ballot until we had some assurance the public was comfortable
7948600 and that they dont have real assurance about how their money is going to be spent
7948601 the first thing wasnt lets go tax lets go see what the residents will pay nuh uh no no no no
7948602 it was lets see what were doing with our budget first lets see what the need is really and then lets engage the public
7948603 so for six months we tore the budget down to zero
7948604 we looked at how we staffed the central office who was doing what
7948605 at the end of six months it was like 173 per parcel with a senior exemption and a five year sunset that is after five years the tax goes away unless you bring it forward for the people to renew
7948606 it was easily passed by almost 80 percent of the voters 79 8 percent to be precise
7948607 but thats because it was transparent everybody knew what the money was specified for we made that very clear and we had a citizen oversight committee to make sure thats the way it happened

7948628 we then worked with sega to determine which features would be the best for the game and came up with a list that felt good
7948629 so um the webpage or whatever is just something you do for fun do you have a real job
7948630 well that is our job we dont technically get money for the hours we put in but it is our job
7948631 we were scoring lots of goals in pre season and the team was improving it was really pleasing
7948632 i thought we were in a good moment but we didnt play well in our last three games that was clear
7948633 if you are asking me if i am considering defeat then the answer is no
7948634 they were good in the first game but we were really poor if we improve and play at our level it will be difficult for them
7948635 if we are winning games and not playing well it means we should find it easier to win games when we do play well
7948636 but the team wasnt good enough around them but they showed they are playing together much better
7948637 we are seeing accidents in essex dramatically reduced as a result of our intervention and education campaign but we need to make more of an impact on motorcycle accidents
7948638 there is a perception that it is sometimes easier for motorcyclists to evade detection of offences because of the speed they travel at
7948639 we feel that signs warning of the likelihood of detection by air will be an extra incentive particularly for motorcyclists and all motorists to drive safely and help us to reduce accidents further
7948640 reduce the number of people killed and seriously injured on the roads
7948641 use of the force helicopter will enable officers to obtain video evidence of offences including excess speed
7948642 so um the webpage or whatever is just something you do for fun do you have a real job

7948652 todays announcement by president medvedev that russia will recognise south ossetia and abkhazia is unjustifiable and unacceptable
7948653 i am holding talks today with international partners and will be visiting ukraine tomorrow to ensure the widest possible coalition against russian aggression in georgia

7948671 me encanta lalola esa chica con pinta de travesti aqu de verdad ca a bien desde el principio no como bea la comedia con todas las pegas que se le quieran poner tiene adrede la impostura de las telecomedias viejas utiliza unas situaciones y un lenguaje exagerado como debe ser igual que en ese episodio de roswell que es como embrujada supongo que cualquier guionista de televisi n sabe utilizar uno u otro lenguaje pero tira del m s conveniente al producto y este producto les est saliendo imperfectamente redondo

7948697 it puts russia of course in opposition to a number of security council resolutions to which it is party most appallingly as a member of the p 5
7948698 we obviously cant allow what russias done to go without there being some consequences
7948699 it simply means that the russian president continues not to honor the commitments that the russians have signed on to
7948700 while there have been some significant russian movements they are not yet living up to the terms of the cease fire agreement
7948701 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us

7948706 for a woman living in a l 6 million mansion with a taxpayer funded harvard education guarded by taxpayer funded secret service agents befriended by the ted kennedys who have 8 houses to be lauded as a poor little minority girl who made good is a bunch of crap the tear running down robinsons face is more of the same
7948707 michelles speech didnt change my opinion of her or obama
7948708 were just like you except in those ways in which you are obviously inferior to people like us
7948709 kevin will be remembered by fans as one of the most popular and recognizable players to ever wear the blazers uniform but to people who knew him hell be remembered as one of the warmest and biggest hearted
7948710 i hope he will get a fair trial we really need a change in malaysia
7948711 anwar pushed the message that removing the nep doesnt mean removing assistance from deserving and needy people especially the malays
7948712 elsewhere people talk of a two party system here we have many parties the question in malaysia is whether you can have a second coalition
7948713 we conclude that the magnetic field is the only common and most likely factor responsible for the observed alignment
7948714 senator obama needs to close the sale with voters who want a democrat but because of senator mccains strength at this point they dont want this democrat
7948715 lu gam i dunno the local names for this clams yes for the 28 yrs 1st time i eat
7948716 if i had to tilt one way or the other like an airplane id tilt that way
7948717 i would assume that hell probably say no and if thats the case so be it
7948718 ill get some practice today and tomorrow well be ok i dont know if three or six plays although i would like to do that i dont know what you get out of that really
7948719 it would be safe to say that im leaning toward that
7948720 the most important thing to me is us getting ready as a group and getting ready for miami
7948721 the more work he does with our guys in the group the better
7948722 its the last preseason game and you want to go out and have a good showing but you want to do that whether its the first preseason game or the last
7948723 obviously you want to leave a taste not only in the fans mouths but also for your teammates and coaches as well
7948724 america must stand firmly on the side of freedom and justice
7948725 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the john mccain for president
7948726 its 3 a m and your children are safe and asleep
7948727 this is a sign of the crushing of the first amendment which i happen to think is tragic
7948728 a message left at fines office wasnt immediately returned but a city spokeswoman said she was working to check out mahoneys claims
7948729 put to rest some of the stories that have been going around and a lot of them being talked about on conservative talk radio about her lack of patriotism
7948730 so let me ask you on the record how she did and does the mccain campaign doubt her love of country
7948731 a moving description of her middle class roots as the daughter of a chicago city worker
7948732 she mrs obama took center stage hoping to open minds and ease doubts about her husband
7948733 this is the first time im proud of my country
7948734 seem to be getting worse because sorry to say it people get stupider and stupider every election cycle
7948735 they think off shore drilling is gonna lower the price of gas and they think obama the black guy from the single mother somehow is the elitist

7948740 we hope the agreement will end the differences between the somali leaders
7948741 ten days ago the very existence of tfg transitional federal government was at a critical point the differences were a deciding factor that makes or breaks the transitional period including the peace agreement in djibouti
7948742 i thought i might try to come back for the last couple of games
7948743 of course between me and the other firemen playing ball all those years the bodys getting worn down but the heart is still ticking and ive still got that passion ive still got that burning desire
7948744 the living anatomical specimen by nature is narrative presenting us with characters whose individuality and abilities to emote and communicate remain fully intact whereas the modern versions favor a diagrammatic approach where flesh is stripped of its humanity
7948745 that they which are approved may be made manifest among you
7948746 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7948747 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits

7948773 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7948774 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
7948775 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope that is why i love this country

7948781 i think there is a good chance ill be fighting soon
7948782 the overall mood is still one of caution theres not much out there to get investors excited
7948783 but the bigger picture is that there hasnt really been a major breakdown considering all the bad headlines out there from higher oil prices to the credit crisis and troubled housing sector
7948784 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7948785 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening

7948796 discreto cuando el asunto es relaci n amorosa ronaldinho ga cho recibi una noticia nada agradable luego de que la jugadora sueca afirmara que el brasile o la pidi en matrimonio

7948801 the zionist regime has always shown that aside from the language of guns it does not know any other language
7948802 if israel paid so much to hizbullah for dead soldiers we can demand more for a living soldier
7948803 releasing the palestinian prisoners while captive idf soldier gilad shalit is not yet with us inspires very difficult feelings in me
7948804 we need a strong and decisive leadership that will protect our national interests and israels interest is to return gilad shalit
7948805 we will be required to release prisoners for shalit the significance of this being we have to hold on to them until he is freed
7948806 the release is a very big mistake and i say we should not give up valuable assets that harm the state of israel
7948807 im very happy im looking forward to the move to ashdod
7948808 i am a bit worried about the new school and everything else but im sure it will all be alright
7948809 even though he is coming out of the hospital without a leg at least he is out of the intensive care unit you cant understand this feeling im so excited and so is osher and so is everyone else and this whole amputation thing he is still a child but i think that he has come to terms with that
7948810 he didnt want to return to sderot and i completely understand him we have rented an apartment near the marina and that is where we will be living
7948811 i believe that in a year or two we will go back there the situation would calm down and we will be able to go back sderot is the kind of place that you just cant leave behind you cant find good people like that anywhere else this ceasefire scares me because it feels like they are planning something worse
7948812 i think its extremely important just to keep making forward progress rather than trying prematurely to come to some set of conclusions
7948813 obviously its a complicated time but its always complicated out here
7948814 we decided that time is against us that time is against the moderates and that stagnation is not an option for the israeli government
7948815 this is something that matters a lot to the palestinians
7948816 im going to be faithful and loving to you the rest of my life and the two of us shall become one

7948822 the number of missiles in the hands of hizbullah has doubled if not tripled and that the range of the missiles has been extended and this has been accomplished with the close assistance of the syrians
7948823 hizbullah by admission of its leaders on several occasions has replenished its military capacity since the 2006 war with israel i therefore remain concerned that this border remains vulnerable to such weapons transfers which would represent serious violations of the resolution and constitute a significant threat to the stability and security of lebanon
7948824 starting on september 1 2008 municipal employees will not be present at educational institutions including kindergartens with the exception of special education facilities there will be no transportation to educational institutions with the exception of special education facilities security guards will not be sent and no activity related to the operation of the education system will take place
7948825 the planned one sided cuts are causing the municipalities to collapse and to be unable to fulfill their commitments
7948826 i was not seated down on the convention floor as an alternate but we were close by
7948827 i think also there was a little bit of a push for the sen ted kennedy d mass people to try to talk things up for him but it never got anywhere

7948842 voor justitie is het belangrijk om te weten wat de juiste nationaliteit van iemand is om goede rechtshulpverzoeken te kunnen opstellen
7948843 in het verleden heeft suriname uitleveringsverzoeken van nederland niet voldaan omdat niet duidelijk was om welke nationaliteit het ging
7948844 we zijn heel blij dat de nederlandse autoriteiten zijn ingegaan op de wens tot samenwerking ik ben ervan overtuigd dat de uitwisseling in het voordeel is van beide partijen
7948845 het overgrote deel van de reizigers tussen suriname en nederland reist met de beste bedoelingen
7948846 maar we moeten ook onder ogen zien dat helaas een groot deel van de drugskoeriers die in nederland worden aangehouden via vluchten uit suriname komt

7948851 society as we knew it in the 1950s was completely changing
7948852 a lot of people were just kind of awakening to a lot of old habits and stereotypes and policies that were just unequal and unfair and lopsided
7948853 one of the things i remember the most was just the chicago police departments total out of control actions
7948854 my boss was in chicago at that time and he slept in his car in a parking lot because he didnt dare to move
7948855 theres an underlying anger today certainly but not the vocal anger there was at the time
7948856 people dont feel as endangered as they were at that time nobodys kids going to get drafted the war is not hitting us as hard as it did in the 60s
7948857 i think we have to work very hard not to get apathetic i think thats a problem today

7949082 there was so much i didnt know though it was all around me
7949083 if we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrels heart beat and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence as it is the quickest of us walk about well wadded with stupidity
7949084 i think the guy will do a great job of managing our team and the team has responded really well to him and thats where we are going
7949085 weve worked extremely hard over the last two weeks and im proud to be a miami dolphin
7949086 i mean he doesnt know any of us from the man on the moon right now but he comes into the huddle and says give me your eyes
7949087 we didnt break the huddle good one time and he was like nah nah nah next time weve got to stand and break the huddle just stuff a veteran with great leadership would do its pretty exciting
7949088 he brings management skills to the table he can manage a game really well hes a little bit calmer in there hes seen more situations
7949089 the guy has seen some of these critical situations that are going to come up
7949090 and he understands the speed its going to be a whole lot faster when we play the jets the first game of the season
7949091 we figured it was time to add a little bit more for people to do so we went ahead and got this going the tricky fish
7949092 from what weve learned in the first three months people seem to have a huge thirst for legal news
7949093 the theory behind originally launching it was that people loved the law and order s and the csi s and the crime shows and legal shows if theres that fascination on tv that the same fascination would come in print
7949094 its conceived for a younger audience more of a blue collar audience
7949095 we try to pick topics and write that in such a way that would appeal to ordinary folks
7949096 if the right set of circumstances arose and i saw the opportunity to do something like the investigative series the washington post is doing right now on chandra levy we would absolutely go for that
7949097 its tough to say what we are its quick and fun it gives you your news your gossip your sports but doesnt give you too much of it we know young adults are going to find more information about something if they want it
7949098 the goal is to get about a third of our publication to be user generated
7949099 one thing thats interesting about our idea of the daily conversation and user generated content is that its a real advance from where print media had been especially in the past
7949100 were going to give you the news and youre going to digest it and if you have a response then write a letter to the editor
7949101 this is much more a continual feedback loop which is indicative of the age of technology that were in and the feedback style people are used to in the online world
7949102 we are putting a new product out there that should give us more shelf space
7949103 its trying to reach a new audience its trying to create business and create readership in a market that we havent touched thats really the exciting part to see the baltimore sun media group investing in that this is what we need to do to evolve as a company i dont think newspapers will go anywhere but i think youll see them change and flourish because people will still want to have that a hard copy in their hands
7949104 the landscape has changed in such a way that there are a lot more niche publications now than there were a decade or two ago
7949105 people are intrigued by these exhibit a is obviously a very distinct publication a free publication the reader and the marketplace is more open to something like this today and more willing to try it than they would have been two decades ago
7949106 people today seem to want to get news the way they want it and on topics they want to hear about
7949107 we can focus on one thing and serve our audience really well
7949108 music for gay men to listen to before having sex

7949110 with these new international data plans iphone users can access more data in more countries for less cost
7949111 is the main reason for the fall in uninsured rates for children and for the fall in uninsurance rates in the overall population
7949112 these 2007 uninsured numbers need to be recognized as old numbers
7949113 thats going out on a limb to project an increase because there are too many moving parts
7949114 this is an organization with no known other activities no known financial support of any significance

7949133 i dont sleep well in vans and we drove straight from winnipeg
7949134 ive decided that if you play a place three times and you have the same name as that venue then you can claim it as your own
7949135 but i have a small army of people in winnipeg who know the songs and are free to travel
7949136 i think calling it a solo project undermines the work of the other band members but at the same time im a bit of dictator
7949137 if they dont play what i told them to play i dont really know
7949138 id say if there is a direction were moving in id call it majesty theres more majesty more epic crescendos yeah other than that its mostly the same old same old

7949140 amy and i just had our 10 year anniversary a month ago and i wouldnt trade it for the world but we are a lot more savvy about what it takes to make a relationship work like amy says its not all butterflies and flowers and love songs all the time its work and compromise and sacrifice and keeping yourself under control
7949141 i do think that making music with somebody else is very intimate and you dont have to look very hard in american music history to find affairs that happened because people started playing together
7949142 it just kind of celebrates how close you get to somebody when you play music
7949143 but the driver hit the gas and i mean he hit the gas in the next instant i was on the ground clutching my knee in pain

7949170 thus the islamic notion of hayat or shyness is like a veil placed upon women to protect them from the power that is their sex
7949171 particular patriarchal system that the feminist movement sought to overthrow does not quite exist in the islamic world
7949172 t here are spheres within islam which men and women may dominate unequally but always to a net equity to a balanced social harmony
7949173 m ales and females can coexist and thrive in their overlapping spheres without the encumbrance of a traditionally western categorization of gender roles these narrow interpretations that the feminist movement fought to eradicate have no source in islam
7949174 is not in opposition but as it stands as an article of faith in obedience to the modesty enjoined upon believing women by god
7949175 good idea but shes an incorporeal dragon and the paint wont stick
7949176 i heard there was a bitter hatred between republican loggers and democratic environmental activists but now ive seen with my own eyes that this is not true
7949177 hes in direct contact with heaven and has access to all wisdom

7949182 she has adopted a radical practice of her religion incompatible with essential values of the french community particularly the principle of equality of the sexes
7949183 she lives almost as a recluse isolated from french society
7949184 she has no idea about the secular state or the right to vote she lives in total submission to her male relatives she seems to find this normal and the idea of challenging it has never crossed her mind
7949185 if you follow that to its logical conclusion it means that women whose partners beat them are also not worthy of being french

7949190 i didnt always comport myself in the way that i wanted to
7949191 my private life has been lived in the public arena because yall got me started so young
7949192 i hadnt been out of law school but a year when i got involved in the democratic party
7949193 the only reason i came by is to tell you that i love you
7949194 this is the first time ive ever had security senators dont matter
7949195 the only reason i accepted the nomination so the delaware delegation could be moved up front
7949196 theres still 44 senators older than me i want you to know that i dont give a damn if you remember anything else
7949197 falei para o leonel que n o estou feliz e n o me sentindo bem aqui n o renderia o meu melhor ele me falou que sou importante para o clube mas eu lhe questionei se sou importante porque nem no segundo tempo tenho entrado
7949198 uma oportunidade boa para mim e para o guarani j que o meu futebol pode ser valorizado na s rie a o guarani ainda tem 75 dos meus direitos econ micos e tamb m pode ser favorecido no futuro
7949199 theyve both got an admiration for each other and mark knows how to handle craig
7949200 so i wouldnt be surprised if once again they join together
7949201 he is under contract and is committed to the club craig remains a very important part of our plans for the future
7949202 the club is being run on sound football and business principles in order to develop a squad which can deliver success this season
7949203 no player would be bought or sold unless that helped to achieve that aim
7949204 coaching at milwaukee has been a great experience and i learned so much from our student athletes
7949205 it was an honor to be part of this program for the last two years and i want to thank both our teams for that i could not be more excited for erica and for the teams as she will continue to move the program forward she was a huge part of the success the last two years and this transition is a great situation for our student athletes
7949206 it is great to have a seamless transition in the leadership of our swimming and diving programs for this coming season
7949207 erica has already had a major impact on the growing success of our teams over the last couple of years and she has a bright future ahead of her dave has done a wonderful job positioning our programs for success but the opportunity he received to coach in the big ten was just too good to pass up together dave and erica have laid down a solid foundation and we want to keep the momentum in our swimming and diving programs going in the right direction
7949208 this is an incredible opportunity for me here at uwm
7949209 dave griffore and i have worked hard the past two years in changing the culture of the swimming amp diving program at uwm and improving our finishes at the league championships for the student athletes not that much changes there will be a smooth transition just the face of the program will change philosophy direction all of that is going to stay the same dave and i worked together on every decision and now that will just fall on me not both of us
7949210 bryan has been around a number of years now and he has been a good defenseman for quite some time
7949211 im excited about bryans willingness to come here on a tryout it will certainly pick up the competition level of what is going to take place in training camp
7949212 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7949213 real median household income in the united states climbed 1 3 percent between 2006 and 2007 reaching 50 233
7949214 people are always talking about originality but what does this mean as soon as we are born the world begins to work on us and this goes on to the end
7949215 see women shouldnt drive because when they do they die
7949216 if there is any oppressed minority homosexual religious muslim whatever it is that is the most absurd question that people do ask can you try not to be who you are and so we felt it was very important to show this whole absurd side
7949217 it can only happen at marvel as wolverine comes closer to unlocking the dark secrets of his past an afghan muslim mutant joins the x men you want daring you want different then meet dust as new x men challenges the rules again
7949218 its true i dont know what im doing with my life
7949219 yeah i drive naked through the park and run the stop sign in the dark
7949220 yeah whatever and speaking of things we dont understand is that outfit youre wearing actually a burqa
7949221 no the burqa is about modesty there are boys and men on campus and it is not right for me to show off by exposing myself or flesh to them
7949222 no i do not judge the way you dress i only ask that you do the same for me
7949223 you do judge me i dont need to be lectured by someone whos setting women back fifty years just by walking around like that
7949224 my client has cooperated with authorities consistent with our plea agreement
7949225 and well be asking for a sentence of 24 months
7949226 they wanted to try one more time so they could finish before it started raining again
7949227 that was the one thing that kept her going we just thank god
7949228 a black niqab that covers everything but her sad brown eyes
7949229 lower her niqab enough to reveal her long dark hair and pretty earrings
7949230 look cool in a proper navy blue suit despite the near 100 degree heat
7949231 even her haircut makes sense close cropped in the intense summer heat
7949232 very inspiring and empowering and also eye opening because i had no idea how difficult it was to make a movie and to put all the pieces together
7949233 ive got to say i wasnt getting a chance to play the roles that i really wanted to
7949234 like oh so maybe i can do this and maybe i can continue to do this which would be amazing
7949235 when i floated the idea past my mom who is pretty conservative she was like youre doing what
7949236 and now of course shes like im so proud of you
7949237 i would like to say that i slept with hef but ill dispel that rumor right now
7949238 i have to admit i did very little to emotionally prepare to play shelley darlington i guess shes always been in there somewhere but i did work out and wear a lot of padded bras
7949239 i dont think its a stand against not being a playboy model
7949240 i think shelley will always be a little vain and love her wardrobe and her curves but i think its more about finding her real family and that she realizes that she doesnt belong in that world anymore
7949241 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7949242 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7949243 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7949244 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7949245 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7949246 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7949247 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
7949248 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7949249 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7949250 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
7949251 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter
7949252 there are people who are going to think this is extreme but its easy to defend
7949253 look how long it takes the police or anybody else to get here
7949254 if someone wants to come here and harm someone at least we would have sort of defense
7949255 theres a lot of incidents where that would have saved a number of lives
7949256 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers
7949257 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7949258 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7949259 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7949260 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7949261 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7949262 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7949263 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7949264 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7949265 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level
7949266 we were on a cross country ride in karachi when one of our company the daughter of a german diplomat fell into a bog with her horse
7949267 there were 40 of us we all stood around stunned except for this one man asif ali zardari who jumped in and pulled out the girl and then the horse as well
7949268 during all this time he could have drowned at any time himself
7949269 zardari knew this and accepted it he walked into the marriage knowing it would always be about her and never about him
7949270 they were living their separate lives but both made sure to keep up appearances
7949271 despite his failings he always stood by his family no matter what
7949272 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7949273 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7949274 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7949275 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7949276 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7949277 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7949278 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7949279 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7949280 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7949281 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7949282 cupid should probably take a break on august 27th its set to be a particularly unromantic day in the uk
7949283 to that end were trying to inject a bit of romance by searching for sexy food and looking to give one recipe the accolade of the uks most romantic its the perfect excuse to combine love and food so theres no need to wait for valentines day
7949284 call sysproc set routine opts explain all explsnap all reopt 3
7949285 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
7949286 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
7949287 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
7949288 to be honest i dont really want to say which teams i want to draw in the past i said i wanted to play milan and it happened
7949289 i also said id like to draw barcelona and it happened if i say this time maybe it wont happen
7949290 what i can say is that i dont think we want to play benfica or milan again all i want to do is play against some of the best clubs in the tournament
7949291 i watch those teams a lot especially the premier league sides so maybe that would be good
7949292 catalu a sola gana la mitad de las medallas de espa a
7949293 this mexican joint went far beyond some customize able homemade gaucamole and a good margarita the food was exceptional
7949294 all you need to know is the food is sexually delicious
7949295 really he doesnt look anything like i thought he would
7949296 youre not walking out that door until im happy with your hair
7949297 im wearing a blumarine top with a commes des garcons culotte
7949298 you know what you know you look just like lance bass
7949299 you cant come here but i can recommend some other places where youll be more comfortable
7949300 yeah actually i have a big problem with jews youre all alike
7949301 i dont but youre probably going to because your doorgirl is a raging racist
7949302 vanilla strawberry knickerbocker glory i saw the ghost of lena zavaroni
7949303 pleased to have you on my plate your meat is sweet to me
7949304 its not too hard to see this as a riff on platos cave allegory from the republic
7949305 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7949306 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7949307 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7949308 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7949309 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7949310 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7949311 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7949312 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7949313 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7949314 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

7949323 mute metal and stone can speak volumes to be sure but the politics of language it can be argued have an even louder resonance
7949324 on the matter of politics odessits should speak for themselves in whichever language they choose and not have their language define how others perceive their views or gauge their loyalty as ukrainian citizens
7949325 odesa has always had a strong sense of its unique cosmopolitan history priding itself on loose but real ties with the center rulers have often regarded it as an

7949340 the dark gods march in step and i shall deliver them this world for their pleasure
7949341 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7949342 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7949343 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7949344 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7949345 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7949346 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7949347 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7949348 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7949349 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7949350 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7949351 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7949352 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7949353 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7949354 who are open to doing something on the production side
7949355 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7949356 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7949357 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7949358 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7949359 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7949360 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

7949366 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7949367 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7949368 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7949369 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7949370 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7949371 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

7949383 however these positive aspects are mitigated by the material execution risks associated with the new joint venture and limited visibility on operating performance
7949384 there are challenges in executing the integration but the complementary nature of the products and customers is giving us the confidence we will be able to successfully do this
7949385 compared to europe and asia the north american market is behind the curve
7949386 detroit is largely focused on powertrain technologies such as hybrids or battery powered electric vehicles like the chevrolet volt and less interested in putting fuel saving tips into the infotainment system or gas pedal north american oems have yet to announce an eco friendly technology that operates through a navigation route or that notifies users of inefficient driving
7949387 in a few years its entirely possible that telematics systems will give vehicle manufacturers the capability to re flash powertrain control modules to improve the efficiency of vehicles
7949388 eco telematics also plays a role in hybrid vehicles with routing that optimizes charging of the batteries because of this its crucial for car makers to stay on top of the eco friendly telematics and navigation phenomenon
7949389 in a few years its entirely possible that telematics systems will evolve on the eco front and give vehicle manufacturers the capability to re flash

7949396 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7949397 its obviously something we view with great concern its in violation of commitments theyve made in the six party framework and its clearly a step backward
7949398 and well be having discussions with our other partners in the six party talk to see how things play out in the coming weeks
7949399 as the stats from this month and previous months indicate theres large upwards momentum ready for the myspace music launch
7949400 i think that was really a great launching pad for my career
7949401 the chance to get in front of those guys and play for 10 000 to 15 000 people every night was a huge deal for us
7949402 i remember going out with rascal flatts the first time and we only had one hit
7949403 it gets a little easier to do the show the more hits you have too you can kind of make your show seem like its full of hits
7949404 i think at that time capitol was going through a pretty bad time
7949405 garth brooks he was pretty much retired and wasnt really making any records keith urban hadnt really taken off yet trace adkins was not doing as well as hes doing now they just really didnt have a whole lot going on i think everybody was scared for their jobs then they had the whole regime change over there and i think i was just kind of caught in it
7949406 i think with every album weve been able to find better songs
7949407 i think its definitely as good if not better than the first two

7949420 it seems ridiculous to have to put race into the equation
7949421 shouldnt it be about the merits of the candidates as people
7949422 the thing i like about the scene in jackson is that its not portland its not austin something thats still establishing itself and its not trying to be either one of those other places even though its still up and coming its been here before and its been here the whole time
7949423 we were spread out all over but we wanted to make music together and we decided to do the whole internet band thing
7949424 because we arent all living together we knew it wasnt necessarily something where we would play live shows we hope to someday
7949425 living down here and being a part of starting up one to one studios has definitely put me in the mix
7949426 theres lots of cool stuff going on that i wouldnt have noticed before when i was out of the loop
7949427 it would be demeaning for someone with more experience to take a back seat
7949428 we love hillary and we love her commitment to the party
7949429 i refuse to be emotionally blackmailed to vote for a candidate
7949430 this is a way to help georgia make their web pages visible to the world

7949439 strang is admirably aware that as an evangelical leader he is called foremost of all to uphold his faith and to be discerning in his political engagements
7949440 cameron strang is an evangelical who is not conservative politically but who is pro life and pro marriage he ultimately declined to give the benediction at the democratic convention because he didnt want to appear that he was blessing what had occurred throughout the evening
7949441 evangelicals can acknowledge the attention that the major political parties are affording them while also exercising judgment about how that attention can be misinterpreted

7949446 fully prepped and ready to shoot all we lack is the rest of our budget so we can finalize our lead cast
7949447 some christians came in early with a few hundred thousand dollars and i just assumed the rest of the money would follow quickly
7949448 its surprising to me that most of the christians weve met who have the resources to invest arent familiar with
7949449 blue like jazz is for a college audience that goes to movies every weekend whereas most movies developed within christian circles seem pitched to older audiences that go once or twice a year a few of the investors weve met have kids who love the book but its not like i can wait around until daddy retires this movie like the book doesnt have a ready precedent which is one of the reasons i want to make it but that lack of precedent makes investors uncomfortable that and the sweat that pours off me when i sit in high backed leather chairs
7949450 so how can i expect to cultivate wealthy friends my business partners have a new strategy for these keeping me out of the room
7949451 im a writer and this is par for the course how everything gets done im not discouraged at all this book is something that has sort of operated out of my influence im thankful its a part of my life and career but it has a life of its own and i trust the process that gods going to do what hes going to do if theres a setback i can accept that
7949452 my career path has been full of projects and ventures that didnt have a ready precedent and thats certainly the case with dons book so we take it in stride and trust god will make a way
7949453 but its about ownership if you take their money upfront you relinquish creative control theres a dedicated community thats developed around blue like jazz and don and i feel a responsibility to make something consistent with the spirit of the book
7949454 we want to maintain that for this film we want our own vision to stay and we have a very strong vision we dont want to risk the execution of the movie to a studio
7949455 i made a deal with my wife back then that wed only use that strategy once
7949456 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7949457 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get our country back on the right path
7949458 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7949459 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
7949460 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
7949461 this whole thing about the nomination roll call for clinton to introduce that kind of uncertainty is just what you dont want
7949462 didnt always comport myself in the way that i wanted to
7949463 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7949464 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7949465 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7949466 permatang pauh has given a clear signal to the leadership of this country we demand change we want freedom we dont want to live with corruption and oppression
7949467 it is anwar versus the entire government god willing i am confident of winning
7949468 it was his home ground so that was always an advantage because he has a lot of support there
7949469 we expected him to win this just proves there is nothing wrong with our electoral system but i still doubt he will be able to pull off his sept 16 threat
7949470 it is a lie to smear him the government is doing everything they can to shame him
7949471 anwars victory will bring good reforms to our country and will unite all the races in malaysia
7949472 earlier this week we released a beta of the android sdk
7949473 in the accompanying post i mentioned that we had to remove some apis from the platform for android 1 0 and as a result they dont appear in the 0 9 beta sdk and wont appear in 1 0 compatible sdks
7949474 at first remote applications could send arbitrary intents meaning that your google talk friends had almost the same control of your device as you did
7949475 even once that issue was resolved we recognized that we could not trust the identity of the application who sent the request
7949476 an android application using gtalkservice would be reachable from all of the users google talk friends and a flaw in that application could pose an inviting target to a malicious friend or automated malware
7949477 the reason is that we plain ran out of time
7949478 the android bluetooth api was pretty far along but needs some clean up before we can commit to it for the sdk keep in mind that putting it in the 1 0 sdk would have locked us into that api for years to come

7949504 i believe the evidence here shows that if returned to the us the applicant will suffer the harm he has described

7949593 if were unable to secure sufficient time to prepare a competitive proposal theres little option for boeing other than not to submit a bid

7949599 the chinese army again fired on a crowd on monday august 18 in the kham region in eastern tibet he told
7949600 one hundred and forty tibetans are reported to have been killed but the figure needs to be confirmed
7949601 reliable witnesses say that 400 people have been killed in the region of tibetan capital lhasa alone
7949602 killed by bullets even though they were protesting without weapons their bodies were never given back to their families said the tibetan spiritual leader who is in france for a 12 day visit

7949607 russia is waging an uncovered war against georgia all coverage on the conflict zone in the tskhinvali region of south ossetia is based on information from the separatist enclave a procedure employed by the mass media only when that country is at war with another state

7949609 there are scattered groups but actually there is no rescue service we do it on a case by case basis with individual forces a centralized rescue team needs lots of money and this is probably not in the interest of the people who are in charge of the country

7949612 in adjara they are mostly interested in citruses and citrus products whether or not a final agreement can be reached on the export of these goods depends on the final decision of both parties
7949613 no one cares about adjara and its residents having to do unbearable work all year long and then sell produce for small change i would be very glad if something changes we love our region and our farms but we must see results after all our hard work
7949614 the blueant v1 works great right out of the box and is the easiest to use headset with more and safer features than any other bluetooth headset on the market
7949615 we were pleased to team with sensory on the v1 to be first to market with a voice controlled bluetooth headset
7949616 we believe the v1 will set the bar for the industry in terms of headset ease of use form and functionality
7949617 when it comes to checking headset status it will not be necessary to interpret confusing beep sequences or leds bluegenie
7949618 after using the bluegenie voice interface i never want to go back to my old headset
7949619 a few hours ago i gave an order a very painful order for a commander in chief to give that not a single georgian unit neither a police nor other unit under our control should return fire to end the very intense bombardment
7949620 with the purpose of inciting large scale confrontation and thwarting direct dialogue
7949621 the only way that separatists manage to maintain their grip on power is through military human and technical resources provided to them by the russian federation
7949622 the recent developments have shown clearly that the position of the russian federation will be the decisive factor in how the process will unfold in the tskhinvali region
7949623 the leaders of the russian peacekeeping force told us a few hours ago they have completely lost control over the separatists actions we are in constant contact with the russian foreign ministrys leadership the russian foreign ministry is trying they say they are trying but not succeeding to get the separatists to cease fire

7949628 the hue and cry over manhunt founder crutchleys politics is all too familiar
7949629 for too long many gay rights activists have acted as if throwing temper tantrums will magically bring about their political agenda
7949630 the truth of the matter is that civil rights for gays cant come about without the help of republicans and this means that gay people and straight supporters of gay equality need to stand with not silence people like crutchley who are working to change the gop from within
7949631 gays need only look to california where a state supreme court loaded with republican appointees legalized gay marriage and the republican governor is one of the most powerful pro gay publicly elected officials in the country to understand the importance of making gay rights a bipartisan cause
7949632 that everyone is 1 too pushed for time and 2 too afraid of getting slapped with a lawsuit if they stop to help someone and something goes wrong

7949637 nunes was seen to run from the side of the bank with a pistol and he pointed that pistol at the head of the guard

7949653 the person in front of meyer was told he would be the last person to speak orlando said meyer said he was upset with that so kerry gave him the ok

7949658 in the livermore valley the smoke cleared quickly and did not accumulate the same weather patterns that bring the fog in from the bay also serve to clear the air of smoke thus there was imperceptible impact from the smoke
7949659 as for frost i saw my first frost damage in livermore in my eight harvests here that too was minimal and the shoot tips grew through the frost and we have seen no yield or quality impact in our vineyards

7949670 one day you will shay even joe doesnt think thats icky anymore
7949671 succeeded she did exactly what she was going for because today were talking about the message more than just the overall bling
7949672 and you know shes going to wear something she looks great in that she feels confident in and thats what we saw and she pulled it off very very well
7949673 she didnt want to look too blinged up she didnt want to be too bright i thought she was very simple very understated which might be a good idea because in this era of attack ads the mccain people are saying hey the obamas are elitist theyre caught up in celebrity if she came out in a real fancy dress that would just be more fodder for them
7949674 it was inspired its a neat look women all across the country can do it its a simple v neck three quarter length sleeve woll dress it can be a jersey knit add a pendant youve got something different

7949684 the opium flood waters in afghanistan have started to recede
7949685 this year the historic high water mark of 193 000 hectares of opium cultivated in 2007 has dropped by 19 percent to 157 000 hectares
7949686 the drug threat in afghanistan remains unacceptably high we are particularly concerned by the deterioration in security conditions in the south where the insurgency dominates
7949687 the most glaring example is hilmand province where 103 00 hectares of opium were cultivated this year two thirds of all opium in afghanistan
7949688 if hilmand were a country it would once again be the worlds biggest producer of illicit drugs
7949689 were not satisfied and we will never be satisfied until we really start squeezing poppy cultivation out of the hilmand economy
7949690 early in the morning monday we started getting reports from our staff who live in the camp that armed vehicles were coming to the edges of the camp on different sides then at about 9 15 in the morning they called us to say they could hear heavy shooting and we started receiving casualties in our clinic so by the end of the day we had 65 people with gunshot wounds in our clinic

7949747 in the accompanying post i mentioned that we had to remove some apis from the platform for android 1 0 and as a result they dont appear in the 0 9 beta sdk and wont appear in 1 0 compatible sdks
7949748 at first remote applications could send arbitrary intents meaning that your google talk friends had almost the same control of your device as you did
7949749 even once that issue was resolved we recognized that we could not trust the identity of the application who sent the request
7949750 an android application using gtalkservice would be reachable from all of the users google talk friends and a flaw in that application could pose an inviting target to a malicious friend or automated malware
7949751 the reason is that we plain ran out of time
7949752 the android bluetooth api was pretty far along but needs some clean up before we can commit to it for the sdk keep in mind that putting it in the 1 0 sdk would have locked us into that api for years to come
7949753 this caregiver kit build is a perfect fit for this historic event because it demonstrates the power in the individuals hands to effect change and improve lives
7949754 were grateful to the one campaign for their partnership and to the delegates for their participation
7949755 were all in this together ending extreme poverty and preventable global disease requires all of us to come together and do what we can to change the world that can mean uniting our voices as one to call for change or rolling up our sleeves as one to help those in need
7949756 assembling these kits at the democratic convention sends a symbolic message that fighting extreme poverty is an important issue in this election voters delegates and the candidates themselves are demonstrating their commitment to doing more for the worlds poorest people
7949757 were very excited about this partnership with world vision working together at the political conventions we can help to show more people what their individual efforts can do to save lives around the world whether through advocacy or on the ground action americans can bring hope and opportunity to people in developing nations around the world
7949758 be proud of america when barack hussein obama is nominated to be president of the united states

7949762 i suspect they would get away with the fundraising event under current ethics rules but why would they cross the line
7949763 i would advise them to take that word honor out of there
7949764 with the difficulties in the economy stores seem to want to buy closer to their needs rather than buying six to nine months ahead

7949770 i have sad news after 11 years we will be publishing a final 2008 issue of smartphone amp pocket pc magazine and then suspend publication we are working hard to make it the best windows mobile issue ever a keeper a reference guide it is with great regret i make this announcement we are a very small self funded magazine publishing company we did not make this decision lightly especially after 11 years of issues it has become harder and harder to grow our circulation over the past three years since windows mobile changed from being pdas to being phones pocket pc manufacturers like hp used to work with us to offer their customers a free issue of our magazine in their packaging the phone companies have not shown similar interest in working with us the other business challenge has been the lack of advertising sponsorship from microsoft phone companies and oems despite our coverage of their products in order for us to sell subscriptions at current low consumer magazine type prices we must have a stronger and growing circulation and we much attract the large advertisers who benefit the most from our existence of course the irony is that almost 20 million windows mobile units were sold this past microsoft fiscal year we think there is a great opportunity to continue the magazine in this high growth smartphone market for a more sophisticated publishing company or a funded entrepreneur
7949771 today is a great day im typing and my spacebar only works half the time so i tap tap to get it to work it adds a whole new level of excitement to the typing experience thats what im doing typing away about the fact that im typing here i am at my computer typing some more what are you doing today if you dont have anything to do you should maybe jam a piece of gum or a toothpick or pencil eraser or something under your space bar so you can experience what im experiencing then come back and tell me how many tap taps it takes to get a space in there and how long before your tapping thumb begs for mercy

7949784 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
7949785 do you think they were really plotting to kill obama
7949786 i dont want to say yes i dont want to say no
7949787 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out

7949845 our business is to go out of business but thats not happening
7949846 we need to do more education we need people to know how it affects the family as a whole we need less tolerance for domestic violence

7949860 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in the eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
7949861 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
7949862 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
7949863 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
7949864 our findings may change the way some plastic surgeons treat baggy eyes
7949865 our study showed that a component of a patients blepharoplasty procedure should almost routinely involve fat excision rather than these procedures
7949866 although baggy lower eyelids are a significant result of aging and fat expansion there are other factors that can contribute too
7949867 we recommend that surgeons evaluate each component and address them accordingly in an individualized approach to blepharoplasty
7949868 we have been very fortunate to secure some of the nations most distinguished and successful executives to discuss critical business issues facing us in the future

7949872 postercasts now make that information easily accessible and persistent for a worldwide audience
7949873 scivee has been very successful in its goal to build a community around a particular area of research thereby creating a free flow of ideas across generations as well as different professional levels

7949879 to put it in a terminology that harkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires the three grand imperatives of imperial strategy are to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals to keep tributaries pliant and protected and to keep the barbarians from coming together
