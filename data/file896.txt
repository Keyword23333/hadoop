8960028 public toilets in delhi an emphasis on the facilities for women in slum areas
8960029 a man has options but a woman cant urinate in the open as that is deemed uncultured the issue of public toilets affects women the most especially poor women
8960030 people talk about feminism all the time but nobody thinks of a need as basic as a toilet for them despite the fact that our chief minister and mayor are both women
8960031 we are preparing ourselves for the commonwealth games and its horrible that the citys civic agencies do not even perform their basic duties its a violation of the rights of citizens especially women who have no option but to defecate in the open
8960032 one day during my internship with ccs i saw a woman cleaning a public toilet at yusuf sarai it struck me that though she was cleaning the toilet she herself couldnt use it since it was meant only for men like most public toilets in delhi i decided to find out the real status of public conveniences in the city
8960033 in the indian context its sad but true that an ideal woman is one with a dress a smile and a vagina no one cares to look at the number of pipes and organs in her body that are there to give birth to a life and that she needs a hygienic toilet
8960034 officials from the slum department of the mcd said the norm in slum areas is one latrine seat for 150 people and a 20 20 20 latrine seats for men and 20 latrine seats for women for a plot meant for 500 households
8960035 the mcd should make it mandatory for companies who show interest in constructing repairing and maintaining toilets on a bot basis in lucrative areas to also do the same in slum and resettlement areas
8960036 pay and use toilet facilities for women can work as a policy for slum areas every adult can make a one time deposit of rs 100 towards the maintenance fund for the constructed public toilet

8960099 europe needs to act as one when dealing with third parties like russia
8960100 must not learn the wrong lessons from the georgia crisis there can be no going back on fundamental principles of territorial integrity democratic governance and international law
8960101 russia is too enmeshed in the world economy it would be counterproductive
8960102 excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia

8960118 the icc member countries have basically decided to wait and see if the situation changes in pakistan in the next six months and if this happens then the champions trophy would remain with us
8960119 there will be some changes in the ftp as the champions trophy where ever it is held will take three weeks for which all teams must be available
8960120 but we and india threatened to boycott the event if any hasty decision was made after which it was decided to adopt a wait and see policy until next march

8960140 aflatoxin is the number one production concern for corn growers in louisiana
8960141 were in the process now of developing recommendations for farmers on what to do with the rejected corn
8960142 if treated with ammonia it can be used safely as cattle feed but the corn must be treated properly
8960143 ill know in about six to eight weeks if these lines have the resistance i hope they do
8960144 but it will still be years before a resistant variety is ready for commercialization
8960145 when soybeans get ripe they dont like to get wet
8960146 china is way ahead of us in ethanol and biodiesel
8960147 over reliance on widely used herbicides such as glyphosate has led to an increased incidence of weed resistance in other states
8960148 i suggest if you use round bales to make them at the proper stage and then store them under proper cover
8960149 defoliation timing is a balancing act between yield and quality correctly timing application of harvest aids can help to avoid some quality discounts especially high micronaire without compromising yield
8960150 delaying defoliation and harvest exposes the crop to weather related yield and quality losses so we have a lot of good reasons to prepare and harvest cotton as soon as possible
8960151 because their gauges overflowed but in spots it was at least 15 inches
8960152 in the last hoorah out of hurricane fay they got another inch or two these conditions have seemed to drag on for a few weeks
8960153 we should have been harvesting corn wide open in south arkansas two weeks ago instead growers have been sitting and waiting this wet period out
8960154 some of the inundated corn had weak stalks to begin with rainfall and warm weather are ideal for stalk issues to develop and there are fields where corn is starting to go down
8960155 another issue is in some of the looser shucked hybrids hit with all the rainfall the corn matured and then water ran into the shuck thats led to some sprouting
8960156 i spoke with a grower this morning whod gotten at least 15 inches of rain he was concerned that at the base of the ear its kind of like a bucket water was collecting there that caused some sprouting but he didnt think it was bad enough to cause dockage
8960157 weve got at least a few days before the next round of storms i know everyone is hoping tropical storm gustav veers away from us if that hits it would be bad news
8960158 overall it looked good and i think itll still be good corn will it be as good as last year i dont think so but there are still 200 plus bushel cornfields out there
8960159 there are two camps those with bins and the capability to dry grain on farm are harvesting hard right now for the guys with 18 percent moisture and planning to haul it to a terminal or dryer they may wait a little at that moisture level they will be docked i just wouldnt wait too long
8960160 its in the same boat as the corn the crop is behind schedule because of the spring conditions and being planted later we didnt have a lot of march planted milo it was mainly april planted
8960161 and again with all the rains there are pockets especially in grain sorghum that was mature where theres some sprouting in heads
8960162 also stalk rots fusarium charcoal rot are showing up in grain sorghum in many instances growers are more concerned about the crop going down than about sprouting
8960163 with the high cost of fuel energy management has become a major factor in several production practices and is affecting overall profitability
8960164 innovative energy conservation practices and alternative energy sources should be of interest
8960165 the roundtable discussions were one of the highlights of the consultants conference
8960166 and well be looking at adding more roundtable discussions in the production conference workshops to facilitate more questions being asked and more interaction among growers from different regions
8960167 we want to bring the hallway conversations into a roundtable format with experts facilitating those discussions for example a grower in texas may want to talk about strip till farming face to face with a grower in the southeast where that practice has been done for several years we believe that participating in these smaller roundtable discussions with more targeted questions and answers will maximize attendees return on investment
8960168 but its important to note that most of that unexpected production gain was offset by higher demand
8960169 inferred to me that ethanol demand would be at least 4 5 billion bushels for 2009 this suggests that we indeed will have to come up with more acres for the corn and soybeans combined
8960170 it puts into question the wisdom of the agriculture secretarys early decision not to release land from the conservation reserve program he could have waited until the harvest to see what the corn crop was going to look like but thats behind us and it underscores that we are going to be in a tight acreage situation
8960171 in the view of the people ive talked to who have been actually looking at the crops and doing field testing the soybean and corn corps are dramatically different from what usda says they are much more cautious and conservative because of the delayed development and variability of the crop
8960172 we are still very early in a cycle with delayed crops a lot can happen the historical trend is if we can have a later than normal frost date the potential of the crop is fairly good because of the absence of moisture stress but the weather forecast is still favorable and there is a history of both corn and soybean crops increasing from august till the end of the growing season
8960173 we still arent measuring test weight which in these kinds of years tends to be on the short side i look at iowas corn yield which usda says is the same as last year at 171 bushels per acre and i have to scratch my head a little bit
8960174 if youve been to iowa and youve looked at fields that number just doesnt feel right i believe the september report will have larger crops than this report but i feel like by the time the combines are in the field if we dont find the actual supply there it could start a rally as we look ahead to next year based on the ethanol demand that is forthcoming and the need for 94 million to 96 million acres of corn next year what price buys that acreage with the cost structure that farmers now have
8960175 in prior cycles like this if we go back to bull markets and the need to build supply and acreage we would see global grain stocks up 50 million to 60 million metric tons so the world is not awash in grain
8960176 it leaves me with this cautious feeling going forward that if there is some kind of supply abnormality or dislocation these grain markets will respond very vigorously and abruptly to the upside we just dont have enough supply cushion left
8960177 tell me that the 11 to 11 50 area relative to november should be good support
8960178 but i caution you that we have the harvested to planted ratio back to 94 5 percent so if yields were to rise a bushel or two it would have a significant bearish aspect on soybean stocks
8960179 we could add another 100 million to 150 million bushels there which could push corn ending stocks to 1 billion bushels at the end of the year thats still historically tight particularly with the export number of 2 billion bushels
8960180 as we step back from all these markets the next six weeks will be important
8960181 we dont know how low the crude market will go or how much fund disinvestment is yet to come but as we formulate our bottom sometime between now and the end of september and the first part of october there will again be another bull market in grains i do not feel comfortable that the world has enough grain to get us through the next nine to 12 months without any upside price potential
8960182 weve had ideal growing conditions the only thing of concern right now is the very cool evening temperatures throughout the midwest were actually behind in total growing degree days than we were a year ago
8960183 farmers waiting to sell corn at 8 might be waiting a lifetime i dont think well challenge this summers top in corn in the next three to five years this was a classic bubble in the oil and grain markets just like the high tech stocks bubble back in 2000 it says corn prices are more highly correlated to crude oil prices than anything else ive ever seen this whole corn market is tied to energy more than anything else
8960184 theres been a lot of speculation about the situation around the club as were all aware and maybe i needed to reassure people that actually whats written and whats reported about the club at the moment is not quite what the actual situation is
8960185 it was a case of just making shaun and his dad and his advisors aware that weve got great plans here its a huge project that were trying to get off the floor
8960186 this is the start of a great journey we hope
8960187 were trying to pursue other targets as well which will complement the good players that we already have here but the key to it was to get shaun back through the door and back where he belongs
8960188 shaun is certainly one of those players who benefits from playing week in week out
8960189 that will be a positive for him and he will benefit and i think possibly in the end england will benefit
8960190 thats our aim we want him back playing international football on a regular basis
8960191 if you are looking for young heroes and role models forget the highly paid athletes who leave their consciences at passport control
8960192 while britains athletes may have won more medals than usual they must remember that they are tainted with the blood of tibetans falun gong practitioners and roman catholic priests who are being tortured and held in labour camps just a few miles from the glittering birds nest stadium
8960193 mr coleman has gone out of his way to personally attack insult and disparage the remarkable achievements of the british team
8960194 we should be giving our young athletes all the resources and support possible not rubbishing and going out of our way to put them down
8960195 these athletes are not wealthy premiership footballers but committed and talented sportsmen who often fit their training around a full time job
8960196 there are of course concerns over chinas human rights record but the way to combat this is not by denigrating our athletes
8960197 it is offensive to suggest so when these fine young men and women are not only doing britain proud but are helping to open china to the world and the world to china
8960198 thats all ill be doing that wont be strange at all
8960199 ive spoken to the manager and ive no problem giving 100 for aston villa and that will be starting against liverpool on sunday
8960200 all i can do is give 100 for the club that is all the fans will want to see anyway i am sure that will be enough
8960201 it has been a long summer there was continuous speculation but i feel i am strong enough mentally and ill be fine with it all now
8960202 i always take things a season at a time this speculation happened at the end of last season and it has been decided that ill be staying at villa
8960203 ill take this season now concentrate on that and hopefully we can improve on last season
8960204 do i feel like ive been hung out to dry over what has happened that is what the football business is all about
8960205 no se trata como se ha dicho en la prensa de la simulaci n de nuevas armas sino de la seguridad del arsenal
8960206 es igual que en su momento los 100 metros en 10 segundos
8960207 in the first stage some sic is sublimated from the surface
8960208 this deposits as pyramids centered on defects in the substrate
8960209 in the first stage some sic is sublimated from the surface
8960210 this deposits as pyramids centered on defects in the substrate
8960211 horsepower just like fuel economy is a product of efficiency and these vehicles balance both to their best advantage
8960212 im very unhappy with the film i never had a chance to do one scene the way it was written or the way i wanted it to be the script wasnt respected bad producers bad partners it was a terrible experience
8960213 theres always going to be a challenge with an agency like this
8960214 you can never fully accomplish the mission theres always someone out there who needs your help
8960215 thanks to supportive legislators who are kind of tired of politics as usual and recognize the need to do some things differently and really start progressing the state
8960216 theyre cooperating together i think the public at large likes that
8960217 it certainly was a huge improvement over the last administration the whole mood was a mood of more cooperation this year than it has been since ive been in the legislature
8960218 im a great admirer of the governor and the governors a good friend of mine and i think we work together pretty well
8960219 its gone on a little too long the friction i think we should have been able to figure out a way to work together and communicate with each other better by now
8960220 im hoping that the next session is a clean slate
8960221 weve been standing on the sidelines for years looking for an executive within this state to start sticking up for what the vast majority of average alaskans believe in not what the establishment wants or the people that wear 1 000 suits in the capital of juneau want
8960222 what the guy hauling trash wants what the school teacher wants
8960223 i cant imagine anyone that i can think of right now who would be more appealing as a vice presidential candidate
8960224 what helps her obviously is that shes a woman shes attractive shes a conservative she has a strong record of integrity shes a spending cutter shes not a tax raiser and those things obviously would help
8960225 im not sure shes ready to be vice president yet however
8960226 wouldnt it be horrible if we were the ones to kill it the show
8960227 the show is so loved i hope it does well everyone knows that sunday night is where all the channels put their biggest shows so its a lot of pressure
8960228 make sunday a family night that is rich in pictures and entertainment
8960229 its a show that skewes towards an older demographic to try to push a show towards a younger demographic it doesnt necessarily work
8960230 you always ask what ingredients in a show attract an audience is it the host is it the show itself i think there are times when a format cant be overridden by the stars that you put on it
8960231 dancing traditionally has a much older audience than us i think it may be more a 60 minutes versus dancing battle its certainly a risky move taking it dancing out of tuesday nights
8960232 my god how can he pick someone like that working people why they they they know too much about real life
8960233 mark was my partner my best friend my soulmate and brought great joy to all who knew him
8960234 thank you to everyone for your kind words i request now that you let us grieve for him and please remember him with love
8960235 we are greatly strengthened and helped in this very difficult time by the expressions of sympathy and the kind comments about marks life and career
8960236 we are especially grateful to channel 7 for their consideration towards mark in recent times
8960237 it took two gays and a bigot to put me there
8960238 but apparently in the republican party two parts homo nepotism with just a splash of racist scandal equals a powerful new job
8960239 team victory force gop the patriots and the upper house
8960240 i spend i earn i love meeting people who came from nothing and now own half a city
8960241 was i raising 95 million for senators without fully understanding their platforms
8960242 donors will be drinking sloppiness is bound to ensue i need all eyes on the relics thank you
8960243 nous naurons plus de relations diplomatiques avec la russie selon la convention de vienne dans de tels cas les diplomates russes vont devoir quitter la g orgie
8960244 ich sage meinen mandanten immer wir sind eine verkehrte familie um klar zu machen dass ich voll f r sie da bin und nicht nur in teilzeit
8960245 bis 2020 wird die h lfte aller million re weiblich sein
8960246 the negotiation with them it was very terrible and very materialistic and was very greedy they were asking for more money and more money and more money i think they were very greedy and i think they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
8960247 so far as many relatives i know would say we would gladly repay any compensation money if we could just have our loved ones back
8960248 financial compensation must remain in its inverted commas money cannot buy our families back
8960249 the libyans have achieved what they want and western commerce has got what it wanted too
8960250 i just wish that the needs of the relatives namely a thirst for the truth and for justice would be attended to rather than an alleged hunger for money
8960251 you cant be compensated twice for the same event and whatever it was it was not compensation it was some political device to allow libya to get back into world trade i suppose i dont know
8960252 i cant comment on whether some relatives are greedy i can only say my own conscience is completely clear
8960253 we believe it is right that they receive fair compensation while recognising that for the families concerned no compensation can alleviate the pain and suffering of their loss we disagree with the comments made by seif al islam al gadafy and our thoughts are with the families of lockerbie victims libyas agreement to pay the outstanding compensation due to them helps draw a further line under libyas past support for terrorism
8960254 officers have completed a search of the outbuildings and are in the process of removing vehicles from the site
8960255 forensic specialists will begin the lengthy painstaking process of sifting and examining all of the contents
8960256 he liked to live life big with holidays and cars
8960257 we are very concerned for the safety of kirstie and her family who are in our thoughts and prayers she is a charming popular and hard working girl with many friends all of whom are hoping that she and her family will be found safe and well
8960258 while britains athletes may have won more medals than usual they must remember that they are tainted with the blood of tibetans falun gong practitioners and roman catholic priests
8960259 if you are looking for young heroes and role models forget the highly paid athletes who leave their consciences at passport control and consider the sacrifice being made by our soldiers in afghanistan and iraq
8960260 boris was forced to go to beijing to collect the olympic flag
8960261 i would have told the international olympic committee to put it in the post
8960262 brian coleman is entitled to his views on the olympics which is a matter of taste and political opinion but it is preposterous to suggest that boris johnson was forced to go to beijing
8960263 he rejects absolutely any suggestion that britains athletes are tainted with the blood of tibetans falun gong practitioners and roman catholic priests it is offensive to suggest so when these fine young men and women are not only doing britain proud but are helping to open china to the world and the world to china
8960264 the mayors support for our athletes as they return from beijing has been totally undermined by one of his senior appointments mr coleman has gone out of his way to personally attack insult and disparage the remarkable achievements of the british team
8960265 mr colemans gross insult does nothing but undermine and embarrass the city we should be giving our young athletes all the resources and support possible not rubbishing and going out of our way to put them down
8960266 for a person of his character to embark on this course of action i think he is at the end of his tether
8960267 started to understand some of the issues that face our communities around hate discrimination stereotyping and stigmatisation
8960268 we believe that the current system of benefits for carers is outdated and we recommend the introduction of two distinctive tiers of support for carers offering income replacement support for carers unable to work or working only part time and compensation for the additional costs of caring for all carers in intensive caring roles
8960269 the dwp needs to provide adequate financial support for those who provide care when of working age either by compensating them for the extra costs of caring or if they need to give up work to care through adequate income replacement and pension protection mechanisms
8960270 the current system is enormously complicated and even dwp staff struggle to correctly identify and clearly explain the benefits that carers and their families are entitled to
8960271 it is crucial that the government takes action to boost carers incomes as a matter of urgency
8960272 if the government is serious about reaching an 80 employment rate and empowering people to work it needs to look seriously at how it can remove the barriers that make it very difficult for carers especially those on means tested benefits to engage in the labour market
8960273 this includes 150m over two years so that carers can take short breaks over 6m to support young carers and up to 38m to help them to enter or re enter the job market
8960274 we are working with employers to ensure that carers can have a better balance between their work and caring responsibilities the government is committed to reviewing the care and support system as part of the longer term welfare reform programme
8960275 we welcome this report which is a valuable contribution to the debate we will study the recommendations and respond to them in due course
8960276 we argued for improvements to benefits as part of the governments carers strategy and were bitterly disappointed when none were included
8960277 as well as being insultingly low at just 50 55 per week carers allowance does not recognise carers individual circumstances and discourages them from combining caring with paid work the two tier benefit recommended by the committee would be a major improvement to the current system carers need a separate benefit which recognises that they are not unemployed but are making an important contribution to society
8960278 the committees excellent report lays bare the extent to which carers struggle to access the support they need while carrying out one of the most valuable jobs in our society carers save our health and social care systems billions of pounds and they deserve a better deal in return
8960279 we are delighted that the committee has recognised the potential of care vouchers and we look forward to working with the government and the dwp to implement the committees recommendation
8960280 at the very least the reports conclusions and recommendations should be at the forefront of the current thinking thats going into the green papers on both welfare reform and on social care funding for adult services
8960281 some historical lines of corn down to what were selling
8960282 little rocks as corn has been domesticated over thousands and thousands of years it slowly separated the male portion the tassels slowly came to the top and the ear moved to the center
8960283 one of the intermediate stages is this pod corn where every kernel on this ear is surrounded by blooms
8960284 farmers began selecting ears they liked and wanted to grow the following year
8960285 although we did a good job of selecting many times the plant would be very inefficient producing many husks and other plant material they didnt need this particular plant is an old open pollinated line look at the tassel its producing millions and millions of pollen grains more pollen than it needs to pollinate the ear
8960286 one main spike and two branches thats all it needs as plant breeders weve bred the extra tassel off it because it was inefficient
8960287 the old lines have leaves that are very floppy and top leaves intercept light and the bottom leaves arent doing anything as far as supporting photosynthate for that ear
8960288 this is 33k44 which is a line we currently sell in missouri you can see how upright the leaves are compared to this plant this allows us to put more plants in an acre and better intercept the light with the added benefits of stronger roots and stalk weve allowed the plant to handle a lot more stress
8960289 hasnt really changed over decades and decades of plant breeding
8960290 what we need to do as a research organization in combination with agriculturalists and end users is translate the genetic potential that farms like kips tell us that corn possesses into national averages then well provide the grain the world so desperately needs
8960291 add in not only the best genes we have from this diverse array of genes we have in our collection
8960292 but combine it with bt technology and modern herbicide tolerance technology to avoid weed competition
8960293 well increase the plants ability to create more yield with less less nitrogen or water
8960294 the most frequent question i was asked for the first 23 years was why do you keep making more corn weve got piles of it everywhere and we have no idea what to do with it the last two and a half years no one has asked that question
8960295 now the question is can you globally increase maize productivity at a rate that will sustain it as an agricultural input
8960296 today we see the power of genetics combined with the power of our breeding programs combined with the talent weve amassed in the last 18 months weve hired 670 people in research and development to basically work on increasing agricultural productivity through genetics and technology
8960297 generally plants grown in a drier climate are water stressed and try to conserve water they dont grow large
8960298 totally different plant architecture just from the environment the plant experiences
8960299 last night a guy asked me why not breed dwarf corn sorghum with an ear we dont have that germ plasm today but thats a possibility
8960300 is to identify how to lead the market so we get there with the right product when its necessary and required
8960301 if we hadnt done the work we did in the 1990s on insect resistance and herbicide tolerance imagine where wed be today in terms of trying to meet the global productivity challenges
8960302 thats why when there was 2 or 1 80 commodity corn people were saying yeah we understand this whole profitability thing and youre trying to eliminate inputs but at that time in the 1990s it was about reducing inputs
8960303 stabilization of production quality grain and higher productivity creating virtual acres if we can double the yield on every acre we can move on and dont have to put highly erodible soil into production thats what were after and were investing a lot of time and talent
8960304 i think david moyes is just looking as we are for loans
8960305 theres a shortage of money out there in the world at the moment it seems
8960306 although sunderland have signed a few players most clubs have not really been spending like they used to and i think they will be spending less and less
8960307 i can see it getting tighter wages have gone up expenses are higher lots of people involved in businesses are struggling
8960308 and clubs are selling players who not long ago you wouldnt expect them to sell
8960309 they are players you thought they wanted to keep so that they could push on and push on and build
8960310 suddenly it has gone the opposite way and one or two other clubs have come in and taken the opportunity to strengthen
8960311 for me as i keep saying it will be the toughest premier league ever look at the other sides
8960312 sunderland are a possible top 10 team this season stoke have just come up but they will be strong they showed that in beating villa
8960313 but certain clubs will still spend certain owners have mega money
8960314 our owner has been fantastic and given us great backing but he knows hes got to balance the books
8960315 if you buy people youve got to sell others to pay for them thats how it should be really
8960316 at pompey i suppose that in the long term weve also got to finance a new training ground and in time a new stadium as well
8960317 i know for a fact that i havent been given the nod
8960318 im disgusted that people players media would think that nick faldo would be that unprofessional
8960319 its pathetic that people can even think thats the case
8960320 nicks a professional hes been a professional the last 30 years of his career and hes not going to start changing now
8960321 i told him basically that my decision is to stay here and play and i got the best answer i could have possibly got off a captain which was youve got to do whats right for you
8960322 nice to be told what to do by one so young and one so inexperienced
8960323 is anyone else speaking to nick faldo no self praise is no praise
8960324 its a very difficult decision not as clear cut as it has been in previous years possibly but i am sure nick will make the right one
8960325 lifes w eird so youd better have a sense of humor
8960326 when its our time to go its our time to go
8960327 aside from the fact that peter robinson has no authority to write any letter on any subject on behalf of ofmdfm the office of first and deputy first minister without the agreement of sinn f in people will be amazed that at a time when there are real outstanding issues to resolve mr robinson has the time to play petty politics
8960328 the regional development strategy produced by drd the department of regional development is an accurate reflection of what was agreed at executive level
8960329 the background to this letter is a query made by rejectionist mep jim allister the pattern seems to be jim allister raises an issue and it becomes a dup priority it is weak politics and no way to do business
8960330 ill just put a female on my ticket to make sure i get more hillary supporters
8960331 now is not the right time to raise taxes on our oil companies
8960332 pursue our domestic sources of energy drawing from our broad and diverse base of options including opening anwr to oil and natural gas development

8960343 it is simply impossible to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
8960344 the chances of hurricane force winds within the next five days are essentially the same at each individual location from the florida panhandle coast westward through the entire coastline of louisiana

8960358 put your knees together girl to dresses that look that that used to be called housedresses lol
8960359 i do believe that mccain has to do something to reshuffle the cards shake up the establishment do something unexpected and governor palin has all the kinds of things that mccain might see as a way to shake things up i think her selection would be something similar to dan quayle dan quayle proved to be sort of an embarrassment as a campaigner being thrust on a national stage like that could be very tough now mondale tried to shake things up by going with geraldine ferraro she proved to be a disaster as a running mate and as a campaigner she was absolutely awful and so i just think that it is very risky for mccain to do this but it may be all he has left
8960360 will we obama be able to go after her on tough issues
8960361 gov of alaska far away from being vp or president
8960362 yesterday kids all over america spent the day looking for easter eggs and today their parents are in new york at bear stearns trying to find their nest eggs today at the white house president bush hosted the annual white house easter egg roll young kids roll easter eggs with spoons across the white house lawn what fun that must be for kids if this was 1908 in more serious news big controversy last week after state department officials looked at passport files of all three major candidates turns out they got a hold of john mccains social security number got his social security number you know what it is three well heres the big brouhaha former new mexico governor bill richardson still thinks hes loyal to the clinton family despite endorsing barack obama loyal he just endorsed barack even bill was more faithful to hillary than that actually the reason this is such a big story is that bill richardson was a member of the clinton cabinet and clinton adviser james carville on good friday he called bill richardson a judas called him a judas well you know there are a lot of biblical references in this race now theyre calling bill clinton jonah because he was once swallowed by a whale and larry craig did not file for re election by the deadline he legally cannot run for office again how about that ironically you know why larry craig missed the filing deadline he was in the mens room a democratic congressman from michigan john dingell wants to put an additional 50 cent tax on every gallon of gasoline gee im starting to understand why the democrats keep blowing these elections see the revenue raised by this goes towards repairing all the damage caused by taxpayers rioting over the fact that gas went up another 50 cents and former new york governor eliot spitzer now in rehab for sex addiction theyre trying to figure out why he wants to have sex with young women with no strings attached i dont know maybe cause hes a guy its just getting worse for him in the new york post today a former madam said that eliot spitzer would pay to watch other couples have sex he would pay to watch other couples have sex well thats something we dont have to worry about the new governor doing we will finally be safe there the president of france said today his country will reduce its arsenal of nuclear weapons because if theres one thing the french hate its being too prepared to defend themselves
8960363 you folks have a nice easter yesterday in new york city was the annual central park easter egg hunt amazing 1 500 eggs they found 1 500 eggs and three dead guys yesterday in new york everybody was in the easter spirit as a matter of fact former governor eliot spitzer he was in the easter spirit he spent the day with someone named bunny did you hear about this two state department employees were fired this is a bit of a scandal because they were looking at barack obamas passport file not only that but the same person was also looking at john mccains civil war records listen to this ladies and gentlemen youre not going to believe this there is a new super toilet on the market being described as high tech low flush senator larry craig just drove one off the lot he said by god ill take that little number senator larry craig from idaho he did not sign up for re election he is not going to run for office again so dont let the stall door hit you on the way out larry after the scandal you get the sordid details this is what i hate were now getting the sordid details with eliot spitzer former governor apparently when he was out whoring during sex he would always wear his black socks i know what you are thinking thanks dave for searing that image in our brains for me the only thing i keep on is my hair piece black socks well for heavens sakes who does this guy think he is rosie odonnell
8960364 judging by these surveillance photos you should get that thing on your ass looked at
8960365 spring is finally here spring when a young mans fancy turns to thoughts of love and eliot spitzer turns to the yellow pages also the fifth anniversary of the iraq war how romantic once again they forgot to greet us with flowers traditionally this is the wood anniversary five which is fitting cause thats what dick cheney gets when he thinks of war the war is going into its sixth year with no end in sight the economy of course is tanking but what is america freaking out about right now that apparently barack obama went to a church and heard his pastor criticize america and just sat there everybody knows when you hear something your pastor says that you dont agree with you get up there and you punch him in the f face and you beat him with the cross not only that this reverend wright apparently he officiated when obama got married wait til they find out the wedding band was the wu tang clan the thing is republicans of course dont allow dangerous religious freaks to advise their campaigns they nominate them of course obama had to answer this did you watch his speech he hit all the notes he said racism is real for black people he said white resentment is real for white people but at the end of the day why cant we all come together with the shared knowledge that asians cant drive the good news is on youtube the obama speech now is getting watched more than the clips of the pastor the bad news is that its still far behind the footage of spitzers hooker on girls gone wild this chick is everywhere i swear to god she won american idol the last person to get this famous for f some idiot was kevin federline new yorks new governor david paterson he made history this week hes black hes blind and hes hornier than the last guy he hadnt taken his hand off the bible when they swore him in before he admitted to having multiple affairs see this is what women dont get about the male sex drive he was blind and he still wanted to see other people and its not easy having an affair when youre blind he used to come home with lipstick on his shoes his wife was cheating too did you know that i would have loved to see that confrontation honey i may be blind but im not blind and now the new york post says that eliot spitzer is in therapy for sex addiction im not sure he really understands the process today he requested an analyst with really big tits

8960368 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them

8960420 is another example of fed bashing that looks good on paper and scores some political points but doesnt have any foundation in reality
8960421 the federal conservative government has increased funding to the arts in the past year from 3 2 billion to 3 4 billion
8960422 we have as i said put our money into this sector and we believe that these cuts will certainly negatively impact on this sector therefore we felt it imperative that we do step up at this particular time
8960423 people should see it for what it is with a health care crisis in the province ongoing issues at mun national media attention this week about unsafe drinking water in rural newfoundland and labrador and his testimony at the cameron inquiry starting to draw closer ramping up the abc campaign helps the premier try to distract from these challenging issues at home
8960424 is it important that it was a work of fiction or a memoir
8960425 i have trouble seeing how this new information changes the extent of the wrong found to be inflicted
8960426 i see no reasonable basis for this action theyre far outside any time limits
8960427 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family

8960432 can you please tell me where i can find the swimsuit rihanna wore to barbados with chris brown

8960434 can you tell me who made it and where can i find something similar for cheaper
8960435 one hundred flys always comes down to finishes and some would say cavics finish was it was at that point 50 50 whether you take another stroke or you take a glide
8960436 you see phelpsy took another stroke he cavic took a glide and obviously phelpss arms are coming over at a faster pace he phelps made the right decision and the other guy made the wrong decision
8960437 but if he phelps had made the other decision he might not have been as lucky and he might have come away with a second and he would have come away with equalling spitzs record
8960438 im not saying he didnt deserve it im saying he did everything he could do to win those golds and he came away with it but at the same time there were little mistakes by other people that allowed him to do that
8960439 i guess what else is left to do for him except come down and win races he hasnt won before

8960453 as part of the mechanism of anemia the body locks away iron
8960454 iron is a component of the hemoglobin molecule that carries oxygen in red blood cells
8960455 iron may also have some role in helping tumours grow
8960456 i dont want people to get the wrong idea some kinds of anemia are definitely bad severe anemia is definitely bad blood transfusions and drugs can be are very useful in moderate doses in these cases
8960457 but pushing the hemoglobin all the way up to normal in people with chronic disease looks to be harmful

8960634 all the woolly hats and fancy stands in the world are quite frankly a waste of time if you dont have a decent team on the park
8960635 a tough talking social conservative with credentials as a reformer
8960636 theres a lot more time and effort put into designing them
8960637 trying to maintain a tiny little mitigation site in the middle of the city its difficult to keep the weeds out of it
8960638 we plan on making a beautiful thing out of it
8960639 in the willamette valley most of what we have left is wetlands
8960640 the regulatory environment has become more problematic for small time mitigation bankers theyre really moving towards bigger companies with deeper pockets
8960641 the agencies are requiring some pretty serious upfront investment now
8960642 we got the business going and some of the ecological returns of some of these banks were not as good as wed hoped
8960643 the newest banks weve applied the lessons weve learned in evaluating the old ones the standards are rising
8960644 it costs money to do quality work a d minus wetland credit is worth the same amount of money as an a plus wetland credit
8960645 if the regulation isnt there to require high quality projects we cant afford to do quality work
8960646 right now it would be more profitable to farm than it would be to start a mitigation bank
8960647 thats a 100 percent subsidized mitigation bank competing in the private sector
8960648 its very difficult if i had it to do over i wouldnt be starting a mitigation bank again
8960649 other states have concluded that it is better for the environment to remove these vessels in a timely manner
8960650 and there are so many problems its obvious theyre going to be there for a while they need to take aggressive action to maintain those ships
8960651 i think this is going to be an opportunity to have a real public discussion on this
8960652 if they ephrata and grant county officials can bring credible evidence that other parties were involved we will look into it
8960653 get it out of my sight and its not my problem
8960654 take this used motor oil and pour it out somewhere on the ground down a street drain bury it in the garbage no one will know
8960655 its just a little leftover paint thinner it wont hurt anything
8960656 oregon is still faring better than many states in the nation
8960657 but we must proceed with prudence and prepare ourselves for tough choices in the next budget cycle
8960658 i think theyre still looking at the technological feasibility versus the economic feasibility
8960659 we have a pretty good idea of what causes ice to melt
8960660 were measuring almost a doubling in the rate of mass loss over the last decade
8960661 in the next century or so its really these small regions like alaska and patagonia that need attention
8960662 its a radical change after 15 000 years to have shrubs come in like this
8960663 if theyre on the ice they have a greater area they can cover
8960664 when we get our fall storms the ice is just not there
8960665 we have to watch it more closely than we ever had to
8960666 if you spend more to adapt to the change now you definitely pay for the costs and then some
8960667 you buy one roll we always give you another sheet free
8960668 have we done a lot in the last two years probably not as much as we should have

8960674 knapp 50 000 kilometer im jahr sind es also schon
8960675 ich fliege nicht gern und mag nicht von fahrpl nen abh ngig sein so nehme ich auf strecken bis 800 kilometer das auto
8960676 mir f llt auch auf dass viele autofahrer ganz unn tig vor kurven bremsen
8960677 irgendwann kommt halt der punkt wo man sich eingestehen muss ich kann es nimmer
8960678 ich bin zufrieden damit wie es heute nachmittag gelaufen ist denn heute morgen kamen wir nicht von anfang an in fahrt das motorrad lief einfach nicht gut
8960679 dann haben wir auf das neue chassis gewechselt und das brachte uns sofort nach vorne wir mussten nur sicherstellen das bestm gliche setup zu finden jetzt bin ich wirklich zufrieden damit wie sich das entwickelt hat
8960680 haben wir weitere nderungen des chassissetups geplant das minimalziel ist in die ersten zwei startreihen zu fahren
8960681 das motorrad hat aus dem stand gut funktioniert und einige der in br nn getesteten neuen teile liefen auch pr chtig
8960682 ich bin wirklich happy denn wir haben heute einen gro en schritt nach vorne gemacht wir haben ein paar dinge ver ndert um die reifen und den rahmen zum harmonieren zu bringen aber jetzt passt alles zusammen gegen ende der session testeten wir neue hinterreifen mit deren grip und konstant war ich sehr zufrieden
8960683 chris ist nahe an loris dran und loris steht knapp davor mit ein paar kleinen nderungen einen riesenschritt nach vorne zu machen er macht auf dieser strecke einen sehr selbstbewussten eindruck das war nicht schlecht
8960684 we are not currently discussing any deal on airbus planes with the syrian airline or authorities
8960685 at no time did todd palin or anyone from the administration pressure commissioner monegan to fire trooper wooten
8960686 walt monegan he knows that as well he was never directed to fire any individual to be accused of that that is a lie
8960687 im sure its going to be addressed at the hearing i would like to think that people would stand up and remember what was discussed and when but i cant speak for them i can only say it happened with both individuals department of adminstration commissioner annette kreitzer and director of boards and commissions frank bailey
8960688 obviously the governors not been getting real good advice about media relationships
8960689 usually its not the initial wrongdoing so much as the cover up and were seeing that now with some of the conflicting statements coming out of the administration
8960690 its way out of my hands now nobodys putting this genie back in the bottle
8960691 es ist nur etwas seltsam wenn man das nummer 18 team gibbs toyota anm d red und das nummer 99 team roush ford anm d red mit ihren teamkollegen vergleicht merkt man dass diese zwar nicht schlecht unterwegs sind aber nicht ann hernd den erfolg haben den diese zwei haben
8960692 die performance des auto nummer 88 dale earnhardt jr anm d red des wagens nummer 24 jeff gordon anm d red und uns wechselt ber die wochen st ndig hin und her es ist wirklich schwer zu sagen wo wir gerade stehen an manchen wochenenden hatte ich das gef hl dass wir einen extrem dominanten wagen haben an anderen wochenenden hatte ich das gef hl dass es nicht mal f r die top 5 oder die top 10 reicht
8960693 mit dem starken team welches wir haben k nnen wir scheinbar immer zur ckschlagen zu k nnen ich denke dass wir vielleicht etwas zur ckliegen und nicht ganz dort sind wo wir stehen wollen wir m chten einen sch nen vorsprung und die meisterschaft klar anf hren und genau das gelingt uns ohne zweifel nicht wirklich
8960694 wir haben diese woche bereits getestet und so hart wie m glich gearbeitet um mehr geschwindigkeit zu finden und dieses auto besser zu verstehen jedes mal wenn wir auf der strecke sind lernen wir etwas was wir auch umsetzen k nnen ich bin auf das kommende gespannt gestern in der testsession lief es f r uns etwas besser als erhofft und das wird sich hoffentlich in kalifornien auszahlen
8960695 valmiro deine beiden piloten liegen momentan an der spitze der privatfahrer wertung sergio und stefano scheinen sich gut zu verstehen doch der saisonendspurt steht an was wird da noch passieren
8960696 genauso hatten wir uns das nat rlich gew nscht die piloten sollen sich gegenseitig respektieren aber allm hlich baut sich zwischen ihnen eine leichte spannung auf wir versuchen daher die struktur um sie herum bestm glich aufrecht zu erhalten
8960697 um jedwede zweifel auszur umen haben wir auch k rzlich die motoren zu bmw geschickt um sie einer kompletten berpr fung zu unterziehen ich denke wir werden die meisterschaft f r uns entscheiden welcher fahrer gewinnt m ssen die beiden allerdings unter sich ausmachen
8960698 die anderen teams beneiden uns denn wir haben wirklich schnelle fahrer ich glaube sergio geht etwas aggressiver zu werke was sich am ende in einem besseren speed bemerkbar macht sergio liegt so immer wieder vor stefano macht allerdings aufgrund der h heren risiken auch mehr fehler da profitiert stefano ganz klar von seiner erfahrung und kann auf lange sicht die konstantere performance an den tag legen
8960699 die technische herangehensweise hat sich etwas ge ndert wir haben f r das diesj hrige auto einige neuheiten eingef hrt die wir bis zum saisonende nat rlich nicht verraten werden unser franz sischer ingenieur renaud dufour hat mit dem team intensiv zusammengearbeitet denn unsere power war einfach nicht gut genug
8960700 wir haben einige tests durchgef hrt um zuverl ssige und sichere konfigurationen zu erhalten und genau dadurch hat sich unsere technische situation gebessert au erdem haben wir weitere kleinigkeiten eingef hrt wie beispielsweise rund um die bremsen das hat sich richtig gelohnt und prompt haben wir brands hatch mit hervorragenden resultaten verlassen
8960701 eine vorhersage auf den ausgang der weltmeisterschaft ist schwierig was erwartet das team in den kommenden wochen
8960702 wir werden weiter so verfahren beiden piloten die gleichen chancen einzur umen und das wird sich auch bis nach dem saisonfinale in macau nicht ndern man muss nat rlich ber cksichtigen dass sich in den beiden letzten rennen bei doppelter punktzahl noch einiges tun kann
8960703 ich hoffe sehr darauf den titel schon im september einzufahren
8960704 ich hoffe sehr darauf den titel bei den herstellern schon im september einzufahren zwischen den l ufen in imola und monza ich w rde meine piloten gerne auf augenh he nach macau bringen damit am ende einer von den beiden den titel holen kann dann m ssten wir n mlich nicht mehr ber die konkurrenz nachdenken
8960705 daher muss das team nun besondere vorsicht walten lassen denn ein kleiner technischer fehler und eine kleine unachtsamkeit seitens des rennstalls k nnte die siegchancen unserer piloten sehr einschr nken meiner meinung nach sollte alles auf der strecke und nicht abseits davon entschieden werden
8960706 kannst du uns etwas ber die rennstrecke in oschersleben sagen
8960707 das ist ein kurs der unserem auto eigentlich weniger gut entgegenkommt wie brands hatch brigens ebenfalls dort konnten wir allerdings einen gro en sieg einfahren ich glaube daher dass wir auch in oschersleben sehr gut abschneiden k nnen
8960708 direkt danach geht es nach imola dort hat es einige ver nderungen gegeben
8960709 eine wirklich unglaubliche geschichte die anlage ist einfach nur sch n und faszinierend der kurs ist etwas sehr besonderes und wird die fahrer auf die probe stellen
8960710 niemand hat dort zuvor testfahrten unternommen also starten im freien training alle bei null alle werden auf dem gleichen niveau anfangen m ssen wir freuen uns sehr ber die r ckkehr nach imola denn proteam hat gute erinnerungen an die strecke und es erf llt uns mit zufriedenheit wieder dorthin zu fahren
8960711 laut dem provisorischen rennkalender f r 2009 sind die ersten drei rennen curitiba puebla und marokko in bersee
8960712 der auftakt der meisterschaft wird ein finanzieller kraftakt werden denn um die wagen erst nach s damerika und dann nach marokko zu schicken muss unser team die n tigen vorbereitungen schon im februar 2009 abgeschlossen haben
8960713 bis dahin m ssen die testfahrten durch und vertr ge mit den piloten unterschrieben sein alle technischen und sportlichen belange sollten dann ebenfalls erledigt sein das wird das team sehr besch ftigen denn die autos gehen im februar auf die reise und kehren erst im april zur ck
8960714 der vollst ndige kalender soll bald ver ffentlicht werden wie ist es daher um eure planungen f r die kommende saison bestellt
8960715 die nahe zukunft wird einen wichtigen wendepunkt f r den rennstall bereithalten denn ende august werden wir ein wichtiges treffen haben was unser technisches programm angeht daf r brauchen wir n mlich noch eine l sung
8960716 uns wurden schon einige m glichkeiten geboten denn die ergebnisse auf der strecke sind den gro en h usern gewiss nicht entgangen jetzt schauen wir uns erst einmal genau an was uns angeboten wurde ich kann nat rlich noch keine genauen angaben dazu machen es k nnte allerdings sehr gut sein dass proteam 2009 zur fronttriebler fraktion geh rt

8960736 its time for a new blog of the time period todays candidate is the mad pigeon im not going to tell you anything about it but trust me youll like it
8960737 i for one regard your blog as one of my daily must reads
8960738 ive yet to read a post of yours that hasnt made me smile think or at least amuse me
8960739 thanks again for keeping us all up to date on popular culture
8960740 you seriously have to be the funniest pigeon ive ever seen flying feathers mad pigeon rules the coop
8960741 just in case i havent mentioned it i think you are bloody brilliant i love your site and i really love your take on things even when i may not agree
8960742 you have a cockswinging irreverence for academic formality yet backed up your topic with solid analytical methodology

8960745 well people have different ideas about what truly constitutes metal so maybe there was some confusion
8960746 metal isnt all i listen to of course but there was a period of time where it was
8960747 i guess it started in school i started listening to stuff with screaming in it and then i started exploring more metal myspace helped me a lot and friends will tell me about certain bands and some of the bands i like arent necessarily
8960748 i love the devil wears prada theyre more hardcore but theyre awesome
8960749 and job for a cowboy is another band i love
8960750 youve got vocals that i cant do the double bass drums the incredible guitar solos every part of the band does more difficult stuff than your average rock band does i listen to these bands and i wish i could do all of that but i cant
8960751 i was the little girl in the red dress and red lipstick and i totally didnt fit in but i had so much fun
8960752 it was awesome i lost my shoes i was going crazy it was awesome
8960753 i would love to secretly do some work on a metal bands album
8960754 i wish i could just secretly do vocals and nobody would know its me
8960755 one time they were actually listening to metal and i was like what are you guys doing listening to metal
8960756 they took a lot of their stage ideas from metal bands from like europe and they use a lot of pyro and stuff like that but they like metal they dont listen to death metal but theyre definitely not opposed to it which i think is really cool it shows that theyre not just some pop band
8960757 even more amped to be able to start playing shows and work on our new material
8960758 it was agreed that we would begin the process of developing a comparative project involving between fifteen and twenty european countries to examine the interrelatedness of the mathematics related beliefs of teachers and students teacher practices and student cognition
8960759 to assume that the development of enthusiasm is sufficient to guarantee achievement would be na ve as there are countries in which students have little enthusiasm for mathematics but achieve relatively highly and of course vice versa
8960760 one of the problems of english education is that students experience a fragmented and procedural conception of mathematics due to underlying notions of vocationalism and so rarely come to see the subject as a coherent body of concepts and relationships which can be worth studying for the intrinsic satisfaction it can yield
8960761 the situation in countries like hungary is almost the complete opposite all students experience an integrated and intellectually worthwhile mathematics taught by teachers with little explicit interest in the applications of the subject but an enthusiasm for logical thinking and the problem solving opportunities that mathematics can provide
8960762 where teachers do not necessarily expect to teach students in ability groups but expect to work with the full ability range achievement is generally higher across the board
8960763 our goal is to identify biomarkers that will help predict which patients will respond to therapy against insulin like growth factor several inhibitors of the igf pathway are in patient studies right now theres a large movement to understand which patients will respond to these drugs this is a step toward that goal
8960764 we have technology now to allow us to globally assess what igf is doing in breast cancer at the whole gene expression level
8960765 this is one of the first studies to do that we know that igf is bad in cancer but now we can globally understand it in a more comprehensive manner it could lead to finding biomarkers for patients response
8960766 we found that igf i is a major regulator of cell growth and cell survival
8960767 if you have something regulating dna repair you want that turned off
8960768 once patients are resistant to hormone treatment as with tamoxifen their treatment options are limited a treatment that inhibited receptors for igf might give them another option
8960769 tell us what do you or the nominee want to be able to do with technology that you cant do now where do you want to be able to use your computer and why why do you want to take your personal technology to the next level

8960787 im looking at him right now and i see perfection palin said yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
8960788 as for that vp talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration we want to make sure that that vp slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up here for the rest of the u s before i can even start addressing that question

8960817 cuando cambiamos el formato de magazine a segmentos decidimos crear este nuevo segmento de ovejita parecer a que estamos haciendo m s nfasis pero en realidad se trata solo de mantener esa presencia del espa ol en un formato diferente
8960818 yo vi plaza s samo toda mi vida de hecho cuando empec a trabajar en esto de los t teres mi sue o era trabajar en plaza s samo
8960819 cuando yo llegu no hablaba mucho ingl s pero ahora despu s de 19 a os ya rosita est muy bien en el ingl s
8960820 me recuerda una vez que me llevaron de vacaciones y conoc unos ni os americanos en un hotel y me hice amiga de una ni a ella no hablaba nada de ingl s y yo no hablaba nada de espa ol pero nos entendimos perfecto
8960821 ovejita es un personaje de lo m s f sico corre por todos lados y es muy energ tica qu le puedo dar para que los ni os se identifiquen bueno pues una risa pegajosa y palabritas en espa ol como adivina
8960822 se enfocan en el personaje y no le ponen atenci n al titiritero no est ensayado murray los entrevista ovejita juega con ellos as que lo que se ve en el segmento es todo natural es todo como fue en la realidad
8960823 i see it as a blog for chris graham to attack people in the community i think its a disgrace he puts himself off as a journalist but hes a rumormonger
8960824 none of them was a saint all of them wanted at times to do the wrong thing to escape what might be political suicide
8960825 in denmark you have to work quite hard to find a crack to fall through a few people with alcohol problems manage to be homeless yes we are the most contented people
8960826 we pay on average 50 percent taxes yes worker or big shot we pay about 50 percent of course we get lots for that weve had national health care since the 1930s we know nothing else if i dont like the shape of my nose i pay to fix that but all else is taken care of
8960827 all education is free and university students get 800 a month for living expenses for up to six years when there is a student demonstration its generally for more pocket money
8960828 we danes believe a familys economic status should have nothing to do with the quality of the health care or the education their children receive i believe in the united states you pay triple per person what we pay for health care your system may be better for business but not better for service
8960829 he offered the money and i accepted it that was wrong
8960830 it was greedy of me and i know that was ethically wrong
8960831 were glad the matter has been resolved but reject totally what the defendants said in court as to their dealings with dylan howard
8960832 a witness was present for all dealings between dylan and the individuals in question
8960833 we support dylan howard and can vouch for the fact that dylans conduct was entirely appropriate
8960834 i have lived through a depression and i have seen the hardships and its coming
8960835 it is unconscionable that pensioners living off a fixed low income may find themselves facing a 50 per cent or 800 increase in their rate bill
8960836 i remember seeing the driver of the ute doing everything in his power not to hit us
8960837 the truth is i was in a hurry and the accident was clearly my fault
8960838 i was familiar with the road im just so sorry
8960839 its a very significant component of what is a wonderful legacy left by clare oliver
8960840 i would very much hope there will be a very substantial reduction in the use of solariums
8960841 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution
8960842 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution
8960843 we have appealed to all parties in the german parliament to give permission to the german navy to take action against pirates
8960844 for example they can arrange a convoy twice a day
8960845 trig is beautiful and already adored by us we knew through early testing he would face special challenges and we feel privileged that god would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives
8960846 im looking at him right now and i see perfection
8960847 yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
8960848 cole opened my eyes to the pain and trouble a lot of families endure
8960849 hes allowed me to see people and circumstance more deeply and the generosity of people
8960850 its in human nature to focus on the negative on what the person cant do in our mind we are focused on what he can do what he will be able to do and do very well
8960851 its the goal of the congressional down syndrome caucus to allow every child with down syndrome to reach their full potential well work to raise expectations and improve education make it easier for people with down syndrome to find jobs and promote funding and research for effective treatments and therapies
8960852 in 1991 cindy mccain was visiting mother teresas orphanage in bangladesh when a dying infant was thrust into her hands
8960853 five days later we met our new daughter nicki at the l a airport wearing the only clothing cindy could find on the trip back a 7 up t shirt she bought in the bangkok airport
8960854 at this stage no banks terms have been given a clean bill of health and all banks remain under investigation
8960855 the purpose of the letters is to start a dialogue with each bank to enable us to reach final conclusions as to whether the terms are unfair and to identify which issues may need to be resolved in court proceedings
8960856 rbs is considering its response this is a key step towards phase 2 of the test case which is not due to start until early 2009
8960857 the oft would not have spent all this time investigating the issue if it did not believe the charges were unfair
8960858 but i believe the oft should now make public the fact it thinks the charges are indeed unfair
8960859 if this opinion of the oft is confirmed with regard to the current charging structure it is difficult to see how the banks will be able to have a system resembling their current overdraft charges at all
8960860 based on our discussions it was determined that it would probably be in dr paxtons best interest and the colleges best interest that he resign as president
8960861 the availability of deepwater rigs has decreased significantly and there is very limited capacity available for 2009 as well as 2010 as a result dayrates for term contracts are now exceeding 600 000 and approaching 700 000
8960862 limited to vintage aston martin lagonda jaguar rolls bentley austin and daimler
8960863 despite testing market conditions we have achieved returns that are broadly in line with market expectations and we have every confidence in our team to continue to drive the business forward
8960864 the first half of this year has been tough with a difficult investment environment and above average claims
8960865 with an industry operating at full capacity and a high oil price energy claims costs have increased significantly during the last two years
8960866 in response energy underwriters have tightened terms and conditions notably for claim deductibles
8960867 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush he vowed to cut taxes for nearly all working class families end the war in iraq bio 90 percent of the time
8960868 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8960869 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8960870 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8960871 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8960872 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8960873 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8960874 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8960875 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8960876 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8960877 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8960878 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8960879 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush
8960880 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8960881 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8960882 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8960883 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8960884 the small town municipal officials do not approve of the type of dance she teaches they believe it is provocative full of sexual innuendo and too dangerous for their township
8960885 pink and black color scheme and the high heeled shoe in her logo
8960886 when i had the weight i couldnt run or move easily and i couldnt bend over or jump high
8960887 but without the weight i can run faster and jump higher
8960888 i felt taller at first and as time went on a whole lot slimmer
8960889 we are working with them for the next four months
8960890 we work with the children and their families teaching parents how to cook and all those kinds of activities getting them more engaged with physical activity so they get a passion
8960891 i understand hes anxious to try and see if he cant get the topic away from the economy but im going to remind him of his statements time and again about his lack of understanding of the economy
8960892 i simply dont think i simply dont think that the people of florida are gonna say the nominee of our party ought to be a person who on more than one occasion has expressed lack of understanding of our economy at a time when the economy is the number one issue that people are talking about here in the state of florida
8960893 i know that there are some people who think as sen mccain did he said you know some jobs are leaving michigan and theyre not coming back i disagree im going to fight for every single job michigan south carolina every state in this country were going to fight for jobs and make sure our future is bright
8960894 just came across this goofy gem of a story idea in ac comics
8960895 lincoln is turning blue a lot now so this will hopefully mean he can be operated on very soon
8960896 distressing for the families involved which is why our government is taking action
8960897 while it will relieve pressure in icu we dont believe it will fix todays cardiac cancellation problems
8960898 these were so old and disgusting they would never be sold as nobody would purchase them
8960899 the old hair systems that were in the seconds boxes were not there to be used on clients because they were so old and heavy
8960900 i know this is the same hair system as it is identical and very rare
8960901 the serial number is not easily removed it would have to be deliberately removed as they dont fall or wash off
8960902 the only reason you would remove the serial number is to avoid identification
8960903 there were at least 20 to 30 old style hair systems in these boxes they were of all varying sizes shapes hair and colours
8960904 this wig was untouched it was in the original state and it had not been cut or styled
8960905 with this type of system the hair is quite long and once it is fitted to the client a hairdresser would then cut and style the hair to the clients needs
8960906 i remember this unit as we were looking for a system for a client to use until his new system came into the store
8960907 well the indian economy is growing and i will make a bet on that
8960908 it was quite surprising to get the call but obviously i didnt hesitate to accept
8960909 you can sense theres a real change in the atmosphere of the wallabies this year a more relaxed feeling and you can see that in the way they play
8960910 the burdens have lifted off the players and they are enjoying their rugby theres no baggage
8960911 there were some people who didnt like to hear what needed to be said at the time
8960912 its been pleasing to see the wallabies being so successful this year under robbie deans and his direction to run the footy and to let guys back themselves
8960913 ive always thought these guys were the dark horses for the tri nations and their win at the weekend confirmed that
8960914 over one third of ontarios public health units lack permanent full time medical officers of health
8960915 especially in light of questions surrounding the public reporting of this listeriosis outbreak the mcguinty liberals need to properly support our public health units
8960916 el piloto decidi no despegar y solicit volver a la plataforma de estacionamiento
8960917 la compa a indic al aeropuerto la posibilidad de sustituir la aeronave
8960918 tambi n comunic al centro de inspecci n aeroportuaria que continuaba con la aeronave
8960919 the effects of this drug are consistent with mcphee being either in a confused state disorientated or even unconscious which resulted in the death of stuart and willey
8960920 i cant forgive i cant forget but i have my son i live for my children
8960921 he mcphee deserves what he got i hate to say it but he does i will never forgive him
8960922 me gusta tu blog entr al m o www lagarompa com
8960923 good schools are about getting people with a common view of where they want to go and working hard together to make it happen and thats what weve done
8960924 its a real thrill i can say for the team the organisation and supporters an absolute thrill that you have come to victoria and are able to spend some time with us particularly as the international patron of the alannah and madeline foundation
8960925 this is our version of buddy which of course is used in the school system now so this is is a little bit of a reflection of the work that you folks have done over in denmark
8960926 the alannah and madeline foundation has been an inspiration for the mary foundation and the work we do at the mary foundation
8960927 i know what happened before all of this they followed me and i was about to wash my car when it happened
8960928 we dont expect to see and dont want to see that sort of behaviour in melbourne or victoria where a cab driver doing his job taking someone home is bashed
8960929 wij dachten dat we eind september verder zouden praten en dat alle opties dan nog open zouden liggen blijkbaar is dat niet zo maar wij verbazen ons na alle perikelen met deze gemeente nergens meer over
8960930 maar we hebben in het verleden als partijgenoten wel eens over de samenwerkingsverbanden in de regio gepraat dan kom je telkens tot de conclusie dat een samenwerkingsverband van deze drie westerwoldse gemeenten een logische keuze zou zijn
8960931 ipx address for 802 3 802 3 is 1991abcd 00001a191c6e

8960936 keep trying to get better than britney was probably too long and decided on a more subtle title o that xtina whats up sista hopefully shes sucked in a few malboros to keep that lungs in check

8960938 i wish i could suddenly announce hes fit for the match
8960939 its a tremendous blow you cant replace arguably the greatest player ever so i hate it
8960940 i wanted his contribution on and off the course and im not going to get it
8960941 you have to value his insight even if he was 10 years retired in absolutely the same way ive called on ray floyd and dave stockton as vice captains
8960942 the best player in the world over 18 holes in match play can be very vulnerable
8960943 i cant see one single positive from tiger woods being missing from our team
8960944 i cant imagine how you can argue a team would be better off without him
8960945 the notable fuel efficiency of boeings 777 combined with the airplanes extensive range and large cargo capacity is something egyptair values highly in this competitive environment
8960946 as a new member of the star alliance we look forward to increasing our connectivity across the globe and bringing our passengers the utmost in cabin comfort and service with a dynamic new business class layout that will debut on the 777 300er
8960947 wed like to congratulate egyptair on its order and acquisition of boeing 777 300ers and on the airlines induction into the star alliance
8960948 the 777s operational performance with its significant savings in fuel and maintenance costs will have a positive impact on egyptairs growth plans and help the airline achieve greater profitability
8960949 change does not come from washington we bring change to washington
8960950 what an ugly way to leave the sun times it does not speak well for you your timing was exquisite you signed a new contract waited until days after the newspaper had paid for your trip to beijing at great cost and then resigned with a two word e mail i quit you saved your explanation for a local television station as someone who was working here for 24 years before you arrived i think you owed us more than that you owed us decency the fact that you saved your attack for tv only completes our portrait of you as a rat on your way out dont let the door bang you on the ass
8960951 what is cinephilia literally the love of film but everybody likes even loves film no the term cinephilia connotes an overwhelming passion for film even an obsession about it and not just particular films i meet civilians all the time who are devoted to their favorites the godfather the princess bride the matrix but theyre not cinephiles so is it just a matter of quantity is it just that the cinephile enjoys a great many movies partly but theres still more to it the cinephile displays symptoms of cinemania as chronicled in the film of the same name but i do see differences for one thing most cinemaniacs like only certain sorts of movies usually american often silent sometimes foreign seldom documentaries do cinemaniacs line up for brakhage or frederick wiseman my sense is not cinephiles by contrast tend to be ecumenical indeed many take pride in the intergalactic breadth of their tastes look at any smart critics ten best lists youll usually see an eclectic mix of arthouse pop and experimental including one or two titles you have never heard of obscurity is important a cinephile is a connoisseur
8960952 easy money was rodney dangerfields follow up to caddyshack it was pretty obvious that rodney could carry a movie the only problem was creating a vehicle where he could do his thing easy money wasnt it easy money finds rodney playing more or less himself in that seemingly reliabe story of a cheerful vulgarian being forced to change his ways in order to receive a big reward in this case it is rodneys monster in law who is leaving him 10 million if he promises to stop drinking smoking gambling and doing all the things we love rodney for for some reason filmmakers think this story is a perfect fit for high wire comic actors it isnt it neuters them from doing what we go to see them do
8960953 watching day of wrath for the second time at age 35 in a crisp new digitally restored print at ifc center i now see much more e t than schindlers list there are no villains no evil just weak and fearful individuals either hiding from or within a system that provides the cruel certainty and definition of wrathful law pretending to justice everyone in day of wrath is only trying to be as human and honorable as he she can be within the limits of a paranoiac theocracy what appeared to my 19 year old eyes to be a dour cold eyed vision of corrupt power destroying innocents in the name of god now appears as delicate and wise about human drives as that scene in e t where elliot so used to having no one to really talk to or play with shows off his toys to the extra terrestrial and prattles on like no tomorrow
8960954 i got an email from these guys celtic racing asking if i wanted to do the race this just came about at the end of last week thursday night
8960955 now im just blowing some rust off its been a long time since ive ridden a road race bike 10 months since the last gp last year at valencia
8960956 the difference here is you know hes got a few other things going
8960957 its hard to find the quality time to do this
8960958 the hardest part about writing a speech like this is not the mechanics of it but what you want to say and how youre going to say it the strategy of it
8960959 when youre working with senator obama the main player on a speech is senator obama
8960960 he is the best speechwriter in the group and he knows what he wants to say and he generally says it better than anybody else would
8960961 this is going to be a more workmanlike speech im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
8960962 i may not be as good as the other headliners the other three nights but hopefully itll make clear the choices the american people are going to face in november
8960963 we have appealed to all parties in the german parliament to give permission to the german navy to take action against pirates
8960964 for example they can arrange a convoy twice a day
8960965 anigaba mid baa guriga ii joogta oo calafkeeda ayay sugeysa
8960966 baryahaan waa yaabnoo gabdhihii soomaliyeed waxaa ku adag in ay helaan rag fiican oo dhaqda waxbeey barteen waa shaqeeyaan balse ragbaan jirin
8960967 dumarka ku dhexnool bulsho dumarka ku badan yahay waxay dareemaan awood dari iyo qiimo daro kaga timaado bulshada
8960968 nin aan is fahmayno deggan dhaqaalo ku filan haysta hal abuurleh kaftan yaqaana akhiyaar ah aan ka cabsanayn inuu muujisto jeceylkiisa diyaar u ah inuu masuul qaado reerna dhaqdo intaa waxaa dheer in uu qurxan yahay muuqaalkiisana fiican yahay
8960969 i have also one girl who is in the conventional age for marrying and waiting for her luck
8960970 nowadays in britain it is difficult for somali girls to find mr right they have admirably risen to the difficulties we are in they study hard and work hard but find difficult to settle down as there are no worthwhile men
8960971 women in such societies would have a subjective sense of powerlessness and would personally be devalued by the society
8960972 soul mate emotionally secure financially stable and intellectually stimulating a good sense of humour a gentleman not afraid to express love and affection ready to commit and accept responsibility in addition he must be reasonably good looking and in good physical shape
8960973 the islamists influence is obvious in the very way that the practice of islam has evolved for diaspora somalis
8960974 what is this guy on all we want to do is give him passengers in a way that is efficient to our corporate customers
8960975 the greatest battles of life are fought out every day in the silent chambers of ones own soul
8960976 governor palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president
8960977 governor palin has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
8960978 john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
8960979 theres been a very long discussion about the trial what happened who won and to some extent thats still going on today
8960980 the usual interpretation is that this was the great rift between science and religion youve got this arrogant scientist up against a dogmatic church and in that head ramming the popes going to win
8960981 interesting to see how people at that time from outside italy are starting to reconstruct galileos life
8960982 i am absolutely delighted by this selection once again john mccain has shown that he is an independent thinker who paints in bold strokes sarah palin is a conservative reformer with executive experience who will bring a breath of fresh air to washington she will be an ideal running mate for john mccain and will make a major contribution to our countrys future
8960983 hey good job nice timing on the mlk angle go you
8960984 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8960985 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8960986 its a complete mystery because you only seem to hear it from indoors and its exactly the same as what is being experienced in suffolk
8960987 the greatest battles of life are fought out every day in the silent chambers of ones own soul
8960988 has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of
8960989 her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
8960990 as for that vp talk all the time ill tell you
8960991 why blame the ham for being too big for the pan change the pan darn it
8960992 the name of cauchon is circulating and its a very likely scenario being worked on hard
8960993 exempting the ski industry from sales tax was put forward in the 60s when the ski industry was very small and the state legislature wanted to encourage and promote it
8960994 i would argue that the ski industry is very much on its feet and has probably grown a few extra feet
8960995 i think it would be an ideal opportunity for the skiing public to help with some of the severe problems that are associated with their recreation activities
8960996 we all are if you think the roads are bad now just wait if we as the state of colorado dont step up and do something
8960997 cest le choix qua fait john mccain pour faire oublier aux lecteurs le discours de barack obama
8960998 she also successfully took on the oil industry leading to a tax increase on oil company profits that now has the states treasury swelling
8960999 typically seen walking the capitol halls in black or red power suits while reading text messages on blackberry screens in each hand palin made a recent appearance in vogue the fashion magazine
8961000 face to face still the best way to connect and communicate you cannot communicate through emails
8961001 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
8961002 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
8961003 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
8961004 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
8961005 the universitys jesuit and marymount traditions have as one of their hallmarks an abiding concern for the education of the whole person
8961006 loyola marymount university places a premium on ecumenical and inter religious dialogue all religions are taken seriously and a genuine welcome is extended to faculty staff and students of diverse faith traditions
8961007 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
8961008 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
8961009 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8961010 a long stretch of unexpectedly good weather the past few days gave me a chance to be outside even to go climbing for a day i have been knitting making pottery and delving more into woodworking in the hopes of eventually finding an apprenticeship in woodworking somewhere on the west coast after official graduation in june
8961011 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
8961012 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
8961013 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8961014 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
8961015 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you

8961529 several members of the media were seen cheering and clapping for barack obama as the illinois senator accepted the democratic nomination thursday standing on the periphery of the football field serving as the democratic convention floor dozens of men and women wearing green media floor passes chanted along with the crowd two members of the foreign press exchanged opportunities to take each others picture while wearing an obama hat and waving a flag
8961530 television journalists were nearly uniformly enthralled with barack obamas thursday night acceptance speech relieved he showed the toughness to take on john mccain directly unlike in their world view all too soft past democratic nominees
8961531 we got to know barack and michelle obama two tall thin rich beautiful people who dont perspire but who nonetheless feel compassion for their squatter and smellier fellow citizens we know that barack could have gone to a prestigious law firm like his big donors in the luxury boxes but he chose to put his ego aside to become a professional politician president of the united states and redeemer of the human race we heard about his time as a community organizer the three most fulfilling months of his life
8961532 when john kerry was introduced at his convention four years ago an honor guard of a dozen mates from his vietnam days surrounded him on the podium attesting to his character and readiness to lead such personal testimonials are the norm the roster of fellow soldiers or fellow senators who could from personal experience vouch for john mccain is rather long at a less partisan date in the calendar that roster might even include democrats russ feingold and edward kennedy with whom john mccain has worked to fashion important legislation
8961533 the coming campaign ought to be a test of whether the country really wants that kind of change we have our doubts and mr obama may have doubts himself which probably explains the audacity of his rhetorical postpartisan disguise weve been disappointed by shooting stars before

8961571 believe it or not there are many evangelicals who are not hung up on abortion and gay issues these are the ones obama has failed to impress tonight i guess he conceded them to mccain

8961574 a 2002 literature review of elective abortion rates found that 9193 of pregnancies with a diagnosis of down syndrome were terminated
8961575 that would seem to leave bobby jindal kay bailey hutchison or rob portman
8961576 if its palin the issue that she knew she was going to have a down syndrome baby and did not abort like 91 93 of those in the same circumstance will be huge

8961580 if mccain can peel away about 15 of hillarys votes suddenly its a very very tight race
8961581 why would it be so hard to believe that someone who is holding an irrational grudge would vote for mccain
8961582 but well see if obamas elected therell be a lot of people doing acid
8961583 gotta say mccains choice is a lot more sensible and gutsy than obamas was the more time biden spends on tv the more his polls go down im betting its not true with her
8961584 among people who identified themselves as hillary clinton supporters 28 percent said they would vote for mccain if obama is his opponent the march 7 22 gallup poll daily election tracking survey found
8961585 my husband has an interesting theory i thought i drop in here he thinks mcbush intends to drop out of the race before the election

8961589 the chicago tribune and nbc reports that john mccain has chosen alaska gov sarah palin as his vice presidential running mate
8961590 and will no doubt make up for any obama bounce
8961591 which is why he did so well in the primary right
8961592 yet perhaps the biggest factor keeping the presidential race close has been obamas inability to close the deal with some of hillary clintons supporters according to the poll 52 percent of them say they will vote for obama but 21 percent are backing mccain with an additional 27 percent who are undecided or want to vote for someone else
8961593 no hes only served his country honorable in military service became a war hero and has served more than two decades in the senate

8961602 i can give him an ultimatum keep the promise he made in 2006 and put the 10 billion in education we wouldnt even be discussing a boycott

8961664 you must never depend on one person and i dont think we wouldve had the success initially without nigel
8961665 we had 24 semifinalists by the time we hit say show five of the live show i felt that id known them for years i did
8961666 and the other problem was they were so media savvy these contestants that they never showed us or you their true personality i mean in parts they were like robots
8961667 hey youre not going to drown i promise you that and if you keep trying to dam things up everything is just going to leak out and seep through at the seams and its just going to slowly flood everything in your life
8961668 nothing i just couldnt wait to kiss you but i had morning breath and wanted to make sure i brushed my teeth first
8961669 i thought oh my god i found someone to help me with my son because she was a counselor and he was having some problems then i found out she was making love to my son in my own house
8961670 while clothing may be deceiving it is still worth noting that gang members usually wear baggy clothing pleated white cotton t shirts undershirts and button up shirts usually buttoned all the way at the top
8961671 aspiring gang members will generally doodle their gang name moniker or common gang slogans
8961672 well we could give him a football cause you know he plays football

8961687 talks about extending the scheme are taking place this september
8961688 i think teams who have deficit should be kicked out of europe the only way to go is that there is a control over all of europe and i think it will go that way whether you like it or not
8961689 uefa will bring in a control of the management of every individual club and every individual club will be controlled
8961690 every transfer nowadays in europe is paid over two or three years and it is compulsory that uefa controls that the commitment of the club is right because if that does not happen it can all collapse very quickly
8961691 thats the promise of america the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
8961692 baron scooter pikes had been confined cuffed and was nonconfrontational there was no need to kill him nevertheless scott nugent a louisiana police officer stunned pikes repeatedly with a taser the man was dead before the last two 50 000 volt shocks were delivered surmised cnn an autopsy revealed no evidence of drug use in pikes system he had been detained for possession nugent was indicted this month on a charge of manslaughter
8961693 i agree that mcmurrin does have his problems especially for any lay member who might google him
8961694 and i hate saying that but what i mean is like madonna she can be hanging out and laughing and then you put the camera on her and its like holy sh
8961695 it was the hardest video ive ever edited because every moment was great
8961696 every moment that she was on camera she was amazing shes got an incredible quality about her she
8961697 she came out in these high heel boots and i was going to say something to her about them
8961698 but on her own she was like id feel better in sneakers her instincts are great she has great charisma and personality
8961699 she started showing me all of her personal items from under her bed that her ex boyfriend gave her so she pulled out his dirty socks and a bunch of photographs
8961700 the necklace shes wearing in the video is the necklace he gave her
8961701 she was very down to earth and its kind of very popular for little girls in the entertainment industry to be kind of bratty
8961702 i couldnt believe how many people wanted to visit the video set and ive worked with people like mariah and madonna she was very gracious and shes very smart she really knows her stuff look whether she wins or not i think shell make a great transition from being a teen star shes very conscientious of her persona and of the crossover
8961703 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world i think we know where the rest of this blog is going if you guessed it had to do with my father then you guessed right
8961704 it really hurts because i have tried after all that my mother and siblings have gone through i really tried to make things work for the hope of having a father again
8961705 he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame why he feels the need to comment on anything in my life that i may want to keep private is beyond comprehension
8961706 if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it samantha has and would never sell me out nor has my mother who is wonderful im not going to engage any further though i probably could go on i have said enough i have a therapist and it is not the cameraman at x17
8961707 i really dont want to say anything because i feel like he wins he being the man who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible i was angry when i first read his attack on me but i believe that actions speak louder than words so now i just pity him
8961708 i feel no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him p s im not the one that is so lost that i need to use my relationship with lindsay to earn a living
8961709 the response by samantha and lindsay regarding what i said is absolutely ridiculous when i first spoke to x17 i clearly started that everything i said and my concerns were generated by my ex wife dina i have taped recordings texts and the corroboration from lawyers and authorities to prove it
8961710 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship i want her to use the gifts she has in the best ways and to help others i said it from the very beginning show me who you walk with and i will tell you who you are people may deceive us but our eyes and facts dont open your eyes
8961711 she went from looking like a little farm girl to looking like royalty now she needs to push back a little so she doesnt look too dowdy or old
8961712 there is a strength now at her age more than when she was working in her 30s with this left over vulnerability from her 20s that was unbelievable to watch when she is shaking her entire body is shaking for real you cant fake that
8961713 we certainly have seen more intense pollen cycles both in number of pollen levels as well as duration of the cycles over the past few years i would say our tree pollen cycle has increased by three weeks and the same with our grass pollen cycle
8961714 weve been following the changes in climate now changes in climate not only include temperature warming during the summer but also higher winter temperatures and that actually may be the more important one but in addition to that with these temperatures and more precipitation were seeing the migration of alpine tundra so its actually disappearing and its being recaptured by other flora and fauna which is gonna create more grasslands more forests and actually probably relocate and redistribute certain insect species
8961715 i do believe were gonna see an increase in severity of simple allergic rhinitis which is actually very significant and it affects peoples quality of life
8961716 were already seeing a significant impact with some of the redistribution of insects and people have allergic reactions and requiring more aggressive therapy for that in fact were now seeing fatal events as a result of it
8961717 and i think beyond that if you step back again a little further were looking at what else is impacted by climate change theres very very very good evidence that were seeing dramatic increases in malaria dengue fever viral encephalitis throughout the world even as a close as mexico and south america and these are directly impacted by climate change even things like hantavirus in the southwestern united states as well as plague in the southwestern united states and west nile virus all of these are probably a reflection of shifts in the environment and shifts in climate
8961718 ohmigod what a great head of hair thats who im voting for and i liked the way he flipped those pancakes the other day at that small town diner showed hes a real man of the people the way he had his sleeves rolled up on his flannel shirt
8961719 i dont court attention i dont go to other peoples premieres i havent been out to a club in london for years when im not working i want to be myself i dont have assistants bodyguards or even a driver because i try to pretend in my own head that this isnt happening
8961720 i have a lot of respect for keira shes another girl whos in a similar position to me but she still has her reputation intact naturally i intend to sully it before the years out only joking
8961721 were having our lawyers review the ruling and will dutifully follow what it says were still trying to figure out what it says
8961722 local school boards can now breathe a sigh of relief
8961723 the state board of education threw them under the bus last month by refusing to adopt the clear specific standards schools need to give the bible the respect it deserves and help them stay out of court now schools wont be required to maneuver through a legal minefield without a map
8961724 texas schools are required to have some type of instruction in the bible which is the hebrew scriptures and new testament
8961725 schools are not required to offer a particular type of course in order to meet the requirement of having some type of instruction in the bible but they have to offer something
8961726 if a school district or charter school chooses to offer a course authorized by section 28 011 and fewer than fifteen students at a campus register to enroll in the course the district or charter school is not required to provide the course at that campus for that semester but that does not mean that the school is not required to comply with the curriculum requirements in subsection 28 002 a 2
8961727 the river was swollen so we almost didnt get back

8961732 inching along at a snails pace feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands

8961737 could i just mention to you jay a moment of seriousness i spent 5 1 2 years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair and i didnt spend those 5 1 2 years because not because i wanted to get a house when i got out
8961738 cindy i refuse to take out the garbage i lived in garbage for 5 1 2 years
8961739 to those who impugn my honor by pointing out that i now support permanent bush tax cuts for the rich after having voted against them i need only mention that after all the suffering i endured for 5 1 2 years i have now earned the right to change my mind
8961740 one of the things ive never tried to do is exploit my vietnam service to my country because it would be totally inappropriate to do so

8961748 i stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger american story
8961749 obama will see a significant bump and we believe it is reasonable to expect nearly a 15 point bounce out of a convention in this political environment
8961750 john mccain says hes a maverick but hes voted with bush over 90 of the time
8961751 it sure makes me not judge people as guilty until i hear everything
8961752 its easy to judge people just because they are here
8961753 its very ironic and thats what everybodys kidding me about saying havent you had enough of this place
8961754 people who go to lakewood are screwballs and nuts we try our hardest not to put anybody who goes to lakewood regularly on any jury

8961760 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8961761 the sight of russian tanks in a neighboring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8961762 trig is beautiful and already adored by us we knew through early testing he would face special challenges and we feel privileged that god would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives we have faith that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential to make this world a better place we are truly blessed
8961763 is even more beautiful inside than out her proud and warm announcement of the birth of their special child revealed the depth of love and faith of this extraordinary woman may god give america more women and statesmen like her
8961764 always liked the middle name van because you know growing up in the 80s van palin which rhymes with rock band van halen would be a really cool name
8961765 its a sign of the times to be able to do this
8961766 i can think of so many male candidates who watched families grow while they were in office my baby will not be at all or in any sense neglected
8961767 on what the person cant do in our mind we are focused on what he can do what he will be able to do and do very well
8961768 many people will express sympathy but you dont want or need that because trig will be a joy children are the most precious and promising ingredient in this mixed up world trig is no different except he has one extra chromosome
8961769 ive always worked with britney and i love working with her im trying to reinvent her and reinvent myself for her project and stuff we did for her is very dancy really uptempo in the clubs real aggressive and catchy very hook friendly

8961792 nun ich war tats chlich an einem pitch zu einem neuen batman film geladen als warner bros damit begann batman begins zu entwickeln es war zwar nicht dass was es nun letztendlich wurde aber von der stimmung her sehr hnlich
8961793 mein ansatz war etwas weniger episch es ging mehr um seine entwicklung und spielte haupts chlich in gotham city ich schickte ihn nicht nach tibet um dort coole leute zu treffen aber es war in etwa die gleiche grundstimmung wie in nolans batman begins
8961794 in meiner version gab es einen neuen gegner keiner der klassischen schurken was wahrscheinlich auch der grund war warum mein vorschlag nicht umgesetzt wurde

8961827 the other foreigners were starved for news and information and my contacts information and clear status as an insider made me the star of the group i never told them anything really secret of course but my sources of information were considered and were impeccable
8961828 over the next two years i was more and more at the centre of things more and more called on to perform sensitive and delicate tasks more and more appreciated and lionised for my efforts everywhere i was in great demand at chairman maos personal request i set up a network to translate and circulate anna louise strongs letters from china i began a whirlwind one man campaign to set up the translation network in beijing and recruited a translator from nearly every major language group

8961831 the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road

8961846 yeah there are no vampires in the treatment there may be a mermaid but im not sure i dont want to give away too much because were letting meyer run with her vision i mean i will say theres a good amount of water in the video and what else can i say
8961847 its cool its not some sort of expos on my life its nice to know were going to make a video for the sake of making a video were making something thats kind of fantastic and different and exciting but isnt about the song specifically and it isnt about me specifically
8961848 im quickly becoming super aware of how big of a deal it is im partway into twilight now i found out about stephenie through a close friend who told me i dont know if you know this but youre referenced in a couple of places on stephenies web site as being a musical inspiration for what she does and i was obviously incredibly flattered especially considering the finger she has on a lot of pop culture
8961849 so we were getting to this place where we were getting video treatments and we had seen a lot of good things but nothing that was really jumping out at us
8961850 so i said can i reach out to her and see if shed be interested in writing for the video and coming out and directing it and we got her music and she was fantastic and weve been working with her ever since
8961851 and it works so well because with my music i always try to create something super visual and create a backdrop where people can take a bunch of experiences but relate them and shes done that in a huge way with her books
8961852 ive just agreed to write a movie for sony and producer scott rudin about how facebook was invented
8961853 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page

8961855 the ideal time for the auctions will be between september and october this year
8961856 theres no doubt that alaskans right now are dealing in an atmosphere of distrust of government and
8961857 hitachi has been more than willing to take peoples money for these tv sets and they should be more than willing to fix them
8961858 in some cases people paid 3 500 or more for these tvs you cant take that kind of money and deliver a defective product
8961859 format surface area equal to that of about new mexico the company said
8961860 battery life will decrease by a small amount its about 20 minutes maybe 30 minutes and thats because theres a larger power draw with the brighter screen
8961861 social ostracism economic injury governmental retaliation and potential physical harm
8961862 parents not the public schools should be responsible for deciding whether their children receive religious education
8961863 religious freedom is eroded when the government endorses any particular religious viewpoint
8961864 s tudents not only face overt compulsion to adopt the religious beliefs of school officials but also must contend with subtle coercive pressures to conform their religious beliefs to those favored by school officials
8961865 often members of groups like the fellowship of christian athletes or the christian world order
8961866 we realize there have been some delays in collection but our crews will continue to work diligently to ensure this disruption is short lived
8961867 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community where it is in fact a court of nato
8961868 i would rather hear you say that not guilty at the end of the trial than at the beginning
8961869 of all the evil men of the balkans he is the worst
8961870 earlier today tsutomu morishita asked akiko mikawa out for a drink but was turned down mikawa works as a secretary in the same company as morishita this is the fifth time morishita has asked mikawa out for a date hes been refused on all but the first occasion
8961871 i slammed my cup down on the table and looked on in disbelief
8961872 its not yet clear why mikawa continues to reject morishita hiruma sakamoto a friend and work colleague of mikawa thinks its because although mikawa doesnt particularly dislike morishita she doesnt particularly like him either
8961873 in view of this evidence its thought that morishita failed to leave any impression at all on mikawa during that original date according to well informed sources morishita went straight to his apartment after work today and is now eating a meal that he prepared himself well thats all we have on tsutomu morishita for today now lets go over to our correspondent at the yakuyoke hachiman night festival in kobe i imagine things are starting to heat up mizuno san
8961874 someones playing a practical joke on me my god all this just to have a laugh
8961875 shinjuku this is shinjuku change here for the yamanote line the train on platform two is for yotsuya kanda and tokyo by the way tsutomu morishita was on this train today all hes had this morning is a glass of milk mind the doors
8961876 i didnt know they were journalists i didnt think theyd put it all in the newspaper like that
8961877 there were four or five men i didnt know any of them they accosted me on my way home and asked all sorts of things about you
8961878 you cant trust the media can you but dont worry personally i couldnt be less interested
8961879 then im not going to know you am i sir
8961880 thats a lot to ask sir if you dont mind me saying so
8961881 unless you know which car it is anyway youd have a job shaking anyone off in this traffic
8961882 i think its that black nissan look its got a newspaper company flag on it
8961883 well all right sir if you insist though personally i think youre being paranoid sir
8961884 well thats perfect take me back to shinjuku will you
8961885 i switched the radio back on didnt i and they were talking about you werent they they said youd been carried off by a rogue taxi driver whod deliberately taken you out of your way and squeezed five hundred yen out of you for it they even mentioned my name
8961886 all right if thats the way you feel anyway will you take me to shinjuku now
8961887 how can i say no next thing theyd say i refused a fare
8961888 but i did lose that black nissan i did really
8961889 but i reckon its not that simple theyre not just following me in a car theyve probably bugged this taxi
8961890 im sure i saw that chopper on the way here sir
8961891 oh dear oh dear oh dear even the skys getting congested now
8961892 and of course therell be more patients as a result but they wont come for treatment until its too late oh no another bad characteristic of people today
8961893 they suddenly started talking about me on tv last night and there were articles about me in this mornings papers they made an announcement about me at the train station i was even mentioned on the radio at work theyre all talking about me in whispers im sure theyve bugged my house and the taxis i travel in in fact im being followed its a major operation that helicopter on the news crashed while it was following me
8961894 but no you come only when your condition is already too serious you give me no option but to admit you to the hospital immediately by force if necessary for theres no doubt about it at all you are suffering from a persecution complex a victim complex in other words total paranoid delusion a classic case of schizophrenia luckily theres no loss of personality as yet ill admit you to the university hospital right away leave it to me
8961895 i was in a hurry i didnt explain myself well i had a feeling you wouldnt believe me im not a good talker i cant express things logically but everything ive just said its nothing to do with any plain fact yet im just an ordinary office worker certainly not famous enough to be followed by the media however you look at it these media people who are tailing me reporting about me theyre the ones who are insane i just came here to ask your advice you know what you think i should do to cope with all this
8961896 everything youve said merely proves how serious your case is
8961897 after leaving his clients office at ginza second street tsutomu morishita an employee of kasumiyama electric industries took another taxi apparently intending to return to his office in shinjuku but he suddenly stopped the taxi and entered the takehara psychiatric clinic in yotsuya
8961898 it is not yet known why morishita entered the clinic
8961899 he just said it didnt he im a company employee just an ordinary person but in spite of that my every move is being watched and broadcast to the entire nation
8961900 well you asked me how you could adapt to an abnormal environment without losing your sanity
8961901 but i find your question contradictory an environment is created by the people who live in it you then are among the people creating your abnormal environment in other words if your environment is abnormal then you must be abnormal too
8961902 therefore if you persist in asserting your own sanity it proves conversely that your environment is in fact normal and that you alone are abnormal if you consider your environment to be abnormal then by all means lose your mind
8961903 all right ill see you at the san jos after work
8961904 now i think we come to a very difficult question at this point
8961905 if events continue to unfold at this pace when do you think morishita and mikawa might be booking into a hotel or might it not come to that professor ohara
8961906 well this akiko is a bit of a shy filly if you know what i mean
8961907 it all depends on morishitas persistence and determination in the saddle
8961908 ill sue for defamation who cares how many times i did it
8961909 id like permission to leave the office on personal business i assume you know about this article im going to complain to the company that publishes this magazine
8961910 but theres surely no point in losing your temper is there the media are too powerful and id always give you permission to leave the office on personal business as you know im quite flexible when it comes to that kind of thing im sure youre aware of that yes im sure you are but im just concerned for your welfare you see i agree its pretty disgraceful this article yes its disgraceful yes i can certainly sympathize with your predicament
8961911 listen mr morishita wed prefer it if you didnt come here you understand
8961912 youre a nobody whose life was reported in the media you were supposed to remain anonymous even when people recognized you we thought youd understand that well enough
8961913 but why did a nobody like me become part of the news
8961914 how should i know i suppose someone decided you were newsworthy
8961915 someone you mean someone in the media what idiot had that idea
8961916 idiot you say as if theres just one person at the bottom of it the media dont need to be told theyll follow someone if they think hes got news value
8961917 well something about the weather forecast being wrong a war going on somewhere a massive power failure an airplane crashes killing a thousand the price of apples goes up the u s president is caught shoplifting someones bitten by a dog a dog is caught shoplifting man lands on mars an actress gets divorced the war to end all wars is about to start a company profits from pollution another newspaper company makes a profit
8961918 so those are the things you regard as big news are they
8961919 not in themselves of course they could be made into big news thats why theyre duly reported but at the same time we report on the life of an ordinary office worker anything can become big news if the media report it
8961920 news value arises only after somethings been reported but you by coming here today have completely destroyed your own news value
8961921 a rockin good way to mess around and fall in love
8961922 vorig jaar lagen we echt met twintig man te ronken in die bus je kon geen kant op het stonk en nu heb je met zijn twee n een eigen kajuit ik slaap met simon op een kamer dat is prima we hebben een eigen douche en een eigen badmeubel dat is wel stukken beter dan die vieze bus
8961923 we zien dit toch wel als een soort vakantie de dingen die we hier doen zijn leuke dingen ook de optredens dus daar word je niet moe van
8961924 het is wel een soort vakantie maar we zijn wel de hele dag bezig
8961925 je moet natuurlijk ook een programma maken maar we hebben voornamelijk lol we hebben gisteren gekart we gaan paintballen en heel veel varen natuurlijk ook
8961926 je wordt s ochtends gewekt door een camera en vervolgens word je gevolgd als je zit te ontbijten kijk de opnamen zijn wel spontaan maar er worden wel dingen ondernomen want als je op een strand blijft liggen tien dagen lang kun je geen tien afleveringen maken uiteindelijk ben je wel gewoon vijftien uur per dag aan het draaien
8961927 vooral nu we iets meer privacy hebben dan in de bus gaat het hartstikke goed
8961928 daarbij komt dat wij als harde kern de 3js jan smit en wij n grote vriendengroep zijn
8961929 we zitten elke avond tot in de late uurtjes met zijn allen op het dek gezellig aan het bier en dan hebben we verhalen te over dus wat dat betreft groeien we denk ik alleen maar dichter naar elkaar toe
8961930 in portugal is het fiftyfifty en dan moeten we het thuis af zien te maken
8961931 ze moeten net als wij nog in hun ritme komen
8961932 in deze ronde gaat het erom door te komen de leuke tegenstanders treffen we dan wel in de groep
8961933 dit is beter dan dat je ergens in een uithoek van europa terechtkomt
8961934 ik weet eerlijk gezegd nog helemaal niets van de ploeg
8961935 ze doen toch elk jaar mee in de europese bekertoernooien een lastige ploeg gepokt en gemazeld
8961936 de besprekingen zijn voorspoedig verlopen ondanks de lastige economische ontwikkelingen
8961937 aside from the fact that peter robinson has no authority to write any letter on any subject on behalf of ofmdfm the office of first and deputy first minister without the agreement of sinn f in people will be amazed that at a time when there are real outstanding issues to resolve mr robinson has the time to play petty politics
8961938 the regional development strategy produced by drd the department of regional development is an accurate reflection of what was agreed at executive level
8961939 the background to this letter is a query made by rejectionist mep jim allister the pattern seems to be jim allister raises an issue and it becomes a dup priority it is weak politics and no way to do business

8961947 ik ken de club absoluut niet maar het lijkt me duidelijk dat we niet in de positie zijn om de tegenstander te onderschatten
8961948 het is geen gemakkelijke tegenstander maar we hadden ook een grotere club kunnen loten

8961965 every four years an astonishing array of conservative commentators and republican campaign strategists suddenly discover an intimate concern for catholic consciences and an overriding preoccupation with the roman churchs sacramental and liturgical norms
8961966 war and recession would push values issues back into perspective in this election cycle abortion is too large a wedge issue to abandon casually
8961967 who described herself as an ardent practicing catholic gave a response that was not only incoherent but managed to get wrong virtually every fact that might have buttressed her pro choice position which by the way is shared by more than half of all u s catholics
8961968 all this conservative crosier waving is about a simple set of numbers
8961969 the republicans think their margin of victory might be found in that 17 many of them white ethnic swing state voters presumed to be socially conservative

8962285 cdw is an instance of one of the bigger dogs demonstrating that they clearly understand that they want to control their own destiny and not necessarily resell someone elses service but instead host deliver and manage their own service and maintain a relationship with their own customers
8962286 we see that more and more customers are continuing to look at ways that they can turn their capital costs into operating costs and this remote backup service offering provides customers backup solution without huge upfront costs
8962287 by adding backup and recovery into our solution we can now provide a full end to end solution for our customers
8962288 televaulting was designed for service provisioning and is an agentless solution
8962289 the theory here is that the less touching that cdw needs to do at the customer site the more profitable the service will be since it is agentless televaulting is very low in terms of people print or foot print from a software point of view
8962290 we provide a set of technology infrastructure labs monitoring reporting and expertise
8962291 in the past there were concerns that there was too much data that had to be pushed across the pipe during the night to make such a service feasible
8962292 now it is quick enough to be reasonable to do backup over the internet
8962293 the thing that is making the stock go down is theyre starting to talk about demand destruction in western europe and in asia
8962294 up until this point the large tech companies like the ibms of the world have done pretty well in holding up their earnings because theyve had strong and consistent international demand
8962295 this shows international economies are slowing down and dell cited that specifically
8962296 it is conservatism that has been relatively consistent for the last six months or so but it is somewhat spreading
8962297 strategic actions to accelerate growth in certain areas of our business affected gross margins this quarter
8962298 its a really tough tech market and dell is obviously cutting costs but it wasnt enough to offset the pressure on gross margin
8962299 what people on the street wanted to see was revenue growth and a solid gross margin number because if you sell things for no profit to some extent whats the point this indicates that they might have to streamline even more now

8962309 so i was wondering why extremetech would allow such blatant misinformation and fud on their site
8962310 mccain voted 90 of the time with bush i dont know about you but i dont want to take a 10 chance on change
8962311 john mccain may pay hundreds of dollars for his shoes but we are the one who will pay for his flip flops
8962312 for years i tried to get producers to have vinny sell his hummer sports utility vehicle and buy a enviromentally friendly toyota prius then i realized this show is entertainment i know that entourage is often demeaning and crude but theres also a lot of social commentary
8962313 that man has a personal grudge because he came here but failed to convince anybody that he was a serious partner and failed to have any stake here
8962314 the problem has never been money because we are not depending on any donors you can even ask rujugiro he will tell you that they are very far with the project
8962315 but there is a bigger picture and it is that methane can be used to establish a gas to liquids industry and produce liquid fuels and pipeline gas there are many benefits to be derived from this resource
8962316 this is significant in rwanda which has a gross domestic product per capita of less that 250 a year and where currently only 6 of the population is connected to power now we have an opportunity to generate power that is 80 cheaper and to also develop enough power to support neighbouring countries
8962317 there isnt a woman in the world that doesnt have a friend or a partner whos actually experiencing some sort of violence against them so i think although domestic violence hasnt happened to me personally i certainly know women who are dealing with this struggle every day
8962318 i am still looking forward to doing a lot of great things
8962319 i get pretty emotional when i see them having a wonderful time
8962320 when they are on a ride and they are screaming and they are happy
8962321 i am writing all the time i love composing and the whole thing but i am also raising my children and enjoying it and teaching them how to ride bicycles and how to read i love it

8962325 somebodys gonna turn on that television and say man if he can be president of the united states then what can i do
8962326 that hope he speaks about is right here its me
8962327 i notified all my kids and my lawyer notified dinas attorney lets see if she has the decency and respect to bring my kids to the wake and funeral this will show her true colors
8962328 thus not even a call but thats par for the course with dina she didnt even send a card or visit when he was sick
8962329 i do not frustrate the grace of god for if righteousness come by the law then christ is dead in vain
8962330 for my part all the use that i got of the law the more
8962331 christ died for me and i am crucified with christ and yet i live but it is christ that lives in me and christ lives in me only by faith
8962332 1 know how i am justified and all the world shall never persuade me to join the righteousness of the law with the righteousness of christ
8962333 that the grace of god shines gloriously in the justifying of a sinner by the righteousness of christ alone
8962334 none properly offended by sin but god and nothing violated by sin so immediately as the law of god
8962335 to justify the wicked and to condemn the righteous are both an abomination in the sight of god
8962336 unto the lambs wife it was granted to be arrayed in fine linen clean and white
8962337 is there more grace in god than there is sin and guilt with me

8962349 the income numbers are a reminder that the economy is going to look worse before it gets better
8962350 supporting paid sick days is a plus for political candidates
8962351 both before and after hearing arguments for and against paid sick days voters indicate they are more likely to vote for a candidate who backed this requirement
8962352 the lack of paid sick days has real consequences for americans forced to choose between losing a days pay or going to work sick
8962353 its difficult for employees to be productive when they are not well they also expose co workers and customers to illness providing paid sick days which this survey shows is favored by the vast majority of americans is a simple matter of good employer practice and good public health
8962354 across all socio demographic groups majorities endorse paid sick days as a fundamental workplace necessity that employers should be required to provide the lack of paid sick days is a concern to those lacking coverage and is associated with dissatisfaction with ones job
8962355 this simple image of an illustration i remember from my childhood book on black beauty that stuck in my head forever im kind of overwhelmed by that image here is this beautiful animal and hes pulling a cab and its night and the streetlights are coming on and it is snowing and the snow is covering him and he is gone in a way its not exactly sad but its more like he has flown away hes disappeared from that path that job of pulling the cab its almost like magic there are certain things you can do in poetry that are truly magic and i dont mean in terms of an illusion you cannot devise this method of magic it just has to happen to me in this poem i have succeeded in doing this

8962408 giocheremo la prima in casa contro la squadra rumena e dovremo scoprirli quantomeno questanno andiamo a londra e non a manchester una bella citt e una squadra che tutti conoscono in un girone nel quale dovremo fare attenzione lesperienza avuta negli scorsi anni far s che giocheremo al massimo contro tutti dobbiamo andare avanti pensando gara dopo gara tutte partono con i presupposti per arrivare in fondo bisogner valutare le situazioni che potranno evidenziarsi nellarco della stagione intanto pensiamo al napoli e poi penseremo allossatura mi auguro che come lo scorso anno si possa disputare un ottimo campionato ed unottima champions league perch vogliamo dedicare qualcosa di grande al nostro presidente che ci ha lasciati poter arrivare primi nel girone ti porterebbe a giocar con squadre competitive ma non di prima fascia noi dobbiamo vivere alla giornata ed i ragazzi hanno dimostrato di saper far bene speriamo che i nuovi acquisti diano un ulteriore contributo
8962409 per me un piacere essere una in grande squadra come la roma e potermi allenare con dei grandi campioni
8962410 non mi piace darmi delle definizioni anche perch compete allallenatore scegliere in che ruolo giocher sicuramente sono stato preso per le mie caratteristiche tecniche e per il modo di giocare in attacco
8962411 sar lallenatore a decidere spero comunque di poter giocare subito e vincere
8962412 spero di riuscire a giocare gi domenica per il resto sono un ragazzo normale che fa cose normali e cercher di dimostrare quello che so fare so che a roma c un pubblico molto caldo spero di entrare presto nei loro cuori
8962413 sicuramente ho avuto modo di legare di pi con mexes perch parla francese e gi lo conosco lui mi ha parlato di totti oggi gli parler per la prima volta
8962414 zidane un grande campione in francia un campione per tutti ha giocato anche in italia in un grande campionato
8962415 youtube forse ha esagerato un po ha fatto vedere solo le cose pi belle giocher in una grande squadra con grandi calciatori e spero di lavorare bene e vincere qualcosa per poi essere convocato in nazionale
8962416 la roma ha tutte le qualit per arrivare fino in fondo tutte le squadre di champions sono forti ci arriveremo solo con tanto lavoro e applicazione sarebbe bello giocare la finale proprio a roma
8962417 questo un po il calcio ci sono cose che non si spiegano io ho deciso di restare al monaco e forse non aver giocato in squadre pi importanti mi ha penalizzato vado avanti lavorando duro sperando di arrivare presto al top
8962418 ho avuto dei problemi di pubalgia una cosa abbastanza comune sono stato operato a giugno e dopo ho continuato a giocare e ad allenarmi con il monaco ormai un problema risolto
8962419 la seguivo in televisione e sicuramente la roma la squadra che gioca il miglior calcio in italia sono contento di giocare qui e spero di migliorarmi
8962420 ci sono stati in precedenza dei contatti con i miei agenti ma la svolta stata dopo lamichevole con il monaco e da l non c stata esitazione
8962421 si ma la squadra che mi ha voluto di pi stata la roma
8962422 vincere qualcosa il desiderio di ogni calciatore speriamo di iniziare da domenica
8962423 sicuramente importante che ci sia un giocatore francese per il mio inserimento ma la volont stata del club e sicuramente la mia
8962424 uno degli obiettivi di giocare nella roma di ottenere la convocazione per la nazionale nella mia selezione

8962445 over the past few years weve seen an increase in the number of students taking ap courses
8962446 i think our biggest problem is that we dont have a lot of students that come in prepared for that kind of stuff

8962702 at the moment its the end of august and were getting moderate pollen counts which is normal for this time of year
8962703 last year we had low pollen counts because of the drought
8962704 people tend to blame the poor old wattle tree because they can see it but that doesnt blow so far
8962705 its trees like silver birch which throws its pollen very early on before there are any leaves on the tree that are the main problem
8962706 we advise asthma sufferers to reduce or avoid outdoor activities in the morning when pollen counts are highest to prevent attacks
8962707 in addition there are many reports of asthma epidemics being associated with thunderstorms because of the airflow patterns which tend to concentrate allergens in a band of air at ground level
8962708 this means that spring storms can cause major asthma problems people with asthma who know they are sensitive to pollens should be particularly careful when storms are predicted on days with high pollen counts

8962730 at a time when many republicans are still clinging to pork barrel politics governor palin has quickly become a leader on this issue

8962732 mccain who is a well known misogynist picks a woman who is clearly a complete light weight and the women who backed hillary clinton a senator who has proven herself in politics and policy are supposed to swoon isnt this kind of insulting to hillarys supporters and to women in general
8962733 mccain has had months to consider his choice and has made it clear to reporters that one of his overriding goals was to avoid a situation like the one in 1988 when dan quayle was thrown into a national campaign with little preparation
8962734 i will do anything to get elected even take a chance that this country will be governed by a stunningly unqualified person

8962763 and the land shall rest a sabbath to ha shem six years you shall sow your fields and six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather its produce and in the seventh year shall be a sabbath for the land a sabbath to ha shem you shall not sow your field and you shall not prune your vineyard
8962764 and the sabbath of the land shall be for you to eat for you and your slave and maidservant and your hired worker and the settler who lives with you and your animal and the wild beast in your land all its produce shall be to eat
8962765 you shall not reap a harvest of what grows by itself and you shall not gather the grapes of your untended vine it shall be a sabbatical year for the land
8962766 six years you shall sow your land and gather its produce and the seventh you shall release and abandon it and the poor of your people shall eat and what they leave over the beast of the field shall eat so too you shall do to your vineyard to your olive
8962767 and for your animal and the wild beast in your land all its produce shall be to eat
8962768 at the end of seven years you shall make a release everyone shall release his claim that he has against his friend he shall not oppress his friend and his brother
8962769 take care lest an unworthy thought be in your heart namely that the seventh year the year of release is near and your eye be evil against your poor brother and you do not give him a loan you shall give to him and your heart sha ll not be sad in giving to him
8962770 and you shall count seven sabbaths of years seven years seven times and you shall sanctify the fiftieth year it shall be a jubilee for you
8962771 and you shall pass a blowing horn in the seventh month on the tenth of the month on the day of atonement you shall pass a horn throughout your land
8962772 a jubilee the fiftieth year shall be for you you shall not sow and not harvest what grows by itself and not gather what is untended for it is a jubilee it shall be holy for you you shall eat its produce from the field
8962773 in this jubilee year you shall return each to his property
8962774 and in all the land of your possession you shall allow the land to be redeemed
8962775 in the jubilee year the field shall return to the one from whom he bought it to the one whose property the land is
8962776 and if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city its redemption shall be until a full year from its sale
8962777 but houses in villages that have no wall around them shall be counted with the fields of the land it can be redeemed and it goes out in the jubilee
8962778 they shall give the levites cities to dwell in and pasture around the cities the cities that you shall give to the levites 48 cities together with their pastures
8962779 and the field of the pasture of their cities shall not be sold

8962782 preparations for an israeli military option intended to stop irans nuclear program are underway
8962783 the debate between those who believe in doing everything including a military operation to prevent iran from getting a nuclear bomb and those who think we can live with iranian nukes has been settled
8962784 if the ayatollahs regime does not fall in the next year if the americans do not strike militarily and if the international sanctions do not break the iranian nuclear plan israel will have to act forcefully
8962785 the americans have accepted the fact that iran will be a nuclear power and are trying to get us to accept it too

8962790 after consultation with diplomatic sources israelnationalnews com has decided to remove the reference to the militant group in niger as terrorist while there may be no credibility to the threat published in reuters as long as there is a possibility that this change will help free the israeli we are happy to comply
8962791 the regions main militant group whose campaign of sabotage has included bombing pipelines and kidnapping foreign oil workers
8962792 belief of the kerry campaign that israel was not a point of differentiation and therefore the campaign did focus on other issues
8962793 george bush with john mccain at his side promised to spread freedom but delivered the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time they misread the threat and misled the country instead of freedom its hamas hizbullah the taliban and dictators everywhere that are on the march
8962794 under george bush the middle east has become more troubled that hurts america and endangers our ally israel which has been forced to confront a resurgent hamas an emboldened hizbullah and an iran determined to get nuclear weapons that is not the change we need
8962795 we entered into an unnecessary war and remain bogged down in iraq as afghanistan backslides and the architects of sept 11 remain free on bush and mccains watch we have witnessed the growing influence of a belligerent iran that has destabilized the middle east and threatens our ally israel
8962796 in his heart in his gut barack obama stands with israel
8962797 understands the threats israel faces from hamas hizbullah syria and iran and as president barack obama will strongly support israels right and capability to defend itself and finally make progress toward the goal of a two state solution that preserves israels security as a jewish state
8962798 a failure to consistently use the power of diplomacy from the middle east to africa to latin america to center and eastern europe
8962799 should we trust john mccains judgment when he rejected talking with iran and then asked what is there to talk about or barack obama who said we must talk and make it clear to iran that its conduct must change
8962800 now after seven years of denial even the bush administration recognizes that we should talk to iran because thats the best way to advance our security again john mccain was wrong barack obama was right
8962801 i dont know how an appeasement policy being advocated by sen obama and sen biden makes israel any more safe and secure
8962802 at the end of the day we took out one of the most despotic dictators and destabilizing regimes in iraq that was paying 25 000 to families of suicide bombers sent to kill israeli civilians
8962803 there is the idea of remembering and never forgetting that this destruction began the day after tisha bav when we mourn the destruction of our holy temples
8962804 its important that they visit here so that they can see and remember what they fed us with as if this thing might bring some sort of salvation or redemption but eventually it slapped back in their faces none of the promises were kept
8962805 i want to commend the activity of the gush katif youth and this is the core that will eventually return to their homes this is a message to the next generation they will continue to lead the struggle we are not tired we are with them but it is time to pass the torch over to the youth
8962806 join us at the yad mordechai junction on september 8th at four oclock
8962807 from there we will reach eli sinai nisanit and dugit the northern gush katif communities we are marking the day the idf completed its retreat from gush katif the day the synagogues were demolished and the graves were uprooted
8962808 we want to return home to the stability to what we are familiar with we dont want to live on a tightrope we fall and get up and fall again we want to return to building its time to replant the seeds and return to life
8962809 the legal authorities must not stand for the phenomenon that is evidenced by alleged rabbi yisrael rosen and not allow such incitement and calls to murder
8962810 peace now will continue in its struggle to put a stop to the illegal construction of settlements and the struggle for a sane future of the state of israel
8962811 we recognise that consumer markets are likely to remain challenging

8962827 the other airlines are quoting 2 500 and we just cant do it well have to cancel our trip but the canadians need to get home they are just going to have to pay out
8962828 we appreciate that airlines go bust but what i object to is that the authorities at the airport made no attempt to communicate with passengers
8962829 baa would have known about this in good time and they didnt let us know
8962830 we were here for 7am yesterday and were told at 5 30pm that zoom had gone under
8962831 we booked into a hotel and we were on the internet until 11 30pm trying to find flights today ba are quoting 2 500 and bmi only have business class seats left it seems that weve been left with no help from anybody
8962832 its a desperate situation it was to be a holiday of a lifetime
8962833 as the failure of zoom yesterday has meant that many hundreds of customers are finding that they could be out of pocket or stranded today
8962834 this failure in a tough economic climate along with numerous other airline failures this year highlights the importance of having financial protection in place when you book flights
8962835 customers with forward bookings who booked using a credit card are advised to contact their credit card company about refunds
8962836 customers who paid by debit or charge card should contact their card company for advice about full or a partial refund where only part of the journey has been completed customers with travel insurance should check their policy to see whether any airline insolvency cover was provided
8962837 we are trying to make as many passengers as possible aware of their options in terms of alternative flights and the possibility of securing refunds for the flights they booked
8962838 there is good availability of alternative flights as we have passed the main holiday period we believe the majority of passengers who booked with us should be able to secure an alternative flight
8962839 we have been in contact with other airlines including ba virgin and flyglobespan in particular and they have made clear the availability of alternative flights

8963045 eco tourism is one of those areas which could easily touch both jon is here at the invitation of the us because we hope that he would be able to spark a discussion between the ministries of culture forestry the environment and tourism and the people of cameroon to see whether eco tourism might be or might not be of cameroonian context and to see what might and might not work here
8963046 one thing that immediately strikes me that was important for costa rica to develop and that seems to be present here is political stability though i have just been three days here cameroon seems to have this stability especially when you compare with some surrounding countries this is an important factor because the government in its international marketing could take advantage of that fact like costa rica cameroon has so much natural and cultural diversity and the government is already taking advantage of that through the countrys slogan cameroon africa in miniature also cameroon has a large amount of forest reserve
8963047 provide accurate information and a good website i dont know if cameroon has tourism offices in other countries i dont know if cameroon has strategic alliances with other tour operators those things are very helpful for people to know more about cameroon when people come here there should be policies and efforts to make the country user friendly road signage maps good roads tourism guides directory of where the good hotels are etc then if we talk about eco tourism in particular certainly you want to have protected areas park fees that could help to provide better quality

8963107 the fact that shes not a washingtonian that she is a reformer that shes outside the beltway is you know a point in her favour the fact that i dont know her the fact that others maybe in washington havent known her and she doesnt know the ways of washington might be the very best thing of all
8963108 this has to be the biggest surprise in this years presidential campaign drama but its a strategically brilliant development for mccain he needed a reformer but he also desperately needed to woo evangelical voters
8963109 governor palins involvement over the years with groups such as feminists for life and fellowship of christian athletes sends all the right messages to these evangelical supporters
8963110 she brings some appeal to women voters who feel that obama has treated hillary clinton badly she also reinforces mccains links to the family values segment of the republican party and she can energize the base and help to close the enthusiasm gap between the obama and mccain campaigns
8963111 the one upside of being seen as the less exciting of the two candidates is that you have the real chance to make an exciting choice with the vice presidential candidate
8963112 this was a fabulous pick not just strategically because it sets up his ticket to be historic but also because this lady is really sharp
8963113 people who havent seen governor palin before will be blown away by her personality and her communication skills are going to make joe biden look even more boring than he already does
8963114 an issue in the election is predictability and reliability the election is likely to remain close because both tickets have elements of uncertainty
8963115 at the margin however the democrat team come out as clearer and more cohesive now so the selection of a relative unknown palin as mccains vp pick is likely to hinder the republicans
8963116 one positive for palin is that as a governor she does have experience running an administration while all the others are senators which tend to be lone positions
8963117 a very bright leader who will bring a fresh perspective
8963118 she brings an excitement on the part of the republican base the strong conservatives really like her and you have to activate the base he is also clearly trying to attract clinton supporters who want to see a female in the vps office on the down side there is no way in the world she passes the commander in chief test obama looks like the grand old man of american politics compared to palin and she makes it look like mccain and his daughter are running
8963119 the markets are not going to be happy with an obama presidency and mccain is not particularly loved by wall street either but if he picks sarah palin i think the conservatives are going to come out roaring in favour its going to be a positive influence on economic activity
8963120 shes a conservative pro life shes a republican obviously for drilling even in alaska and also off shore for increasing supply shes for alternative energies including
8963121 one of the biggest problems the gop faces is being a good ol boy not sensitive to women here youve got a very vivacious young pretty experienced woman more experienced than barack obama i think shes going to bring a lot of disenfranchised clinton women to the gop
8963122 as someone else said you cant be further from washington than alaska so shes going to bring freshness youth and womens rights and womens opportunities right to the forefront meanwhile obama picked the standard guy joe biden
8963123 i thought he would do well to pick a woman on the ticket but i thought he would pick someone with more experience in the senate i dont think this has much market impact

8963191 if we keep accelerating the rate at which we are able to save these very little babies we are likely to see more cases of cerebral palsy in which case we havent saved them neurologically
8963192 our findings are applicable only to early pre term birth
8963193 the woodbury police are excited because they got something thats more serious than a cat up a tree
8963194 this is a very unique case and frankly i dont know the ramifications of anything yet
8963195 were just always looking out the windows the whole neighborhood in general is feeling the same way
8963196 that to me is ridiculous i dont understand how that can happen
8963197 hes going to have to bang a little bit to get in at me and hopefully ill be able to wake up by then
8963198 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl told him that he had come up with a plan on how to murder someone
8963199 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl wanted to find an adult male who lived by himself and within walking distance of the defendants house
8963200 mr busskohl stated that he would then either stab the potential victim in the chest or slash his throat mr busskohl told mr eischens that he would then either cut off the eyelids of the victim or cut out his heart
8963201 im not even sure i would have gone through with it
8963202 the evidence i received he busskohl discussed very openly these things with the police
8963203 within eight to 10 hours the bizarre type of thinking he was undergoing was gone
8963204 if anybody were to meet him and talk to him at this point he represents no threat to anyone
8963205 i didnt even look at it as a murder plot until they actually started putting it on the news
8963206 what bothers me is if you throw a rock hes about four blocks away
8963207 which is a substantial step toward and more than preparation for the commission of the crime
8963208 but if we have somebody thats just simply preparing to commit the crime and does not take a substantial step toward committing that crime we cant charge an attempt and thats what this is all about

8963213 the government is encouraging education and i also felt that i should contribute my own quota by building additional classrooms in gss great soppo which is in dire need of accommodation structures

8963215 i have the knowledge and the experience and the judgment to lead this nation
8963216 one had a kind of moral neutrality to it that comes i think from inexperience

8963221 many have started farming in order to satisfy some of their necessities
8963222 it cannot control production and transportation cost because these goods are not made in cameroon we control only the excessive profit margins on cameroonian markets
8963223 the expired items we have seized and which we are still seizing would be publicly destroyed we are now selling a 50 kg of quality rice only at fcfa 17 750 while the average quality is fcfa 16 250 the prices are higher on the market but as i said we set average prices

8963226 though domestic gas costs fcfa 6500 the quantity of gas that is put in the bottle is small and doesnt correspond to the weight for that bottle
8963227 the price of sugar doesnt permit me to provide for even a breakfast we have forgotten about luxuries but just providing for the basics is yet not easy with price hikes we are unable to save for the future how can one think of the future when we cant even feed well
8963228 only rich people are able to feed well but the majority who are the poor barely survive
8963229 many have started farming in order to satisfy some of their necessities

8963238 they use his mobility to escape and run play action they have good skill and speed at receiver they are going to run the ball take their shots and feel their way through the first game
8963239 they have got a big line several tight ends and running back that are about the size of guards for most teams
8963240 they are talented indeed and their running back situation is pretty secure they have a 230 pound tailback a 250 pound fullback and some good tight ends one of whom is extremely good at receiving
8963241 its a great feeling to pound it out and take out your aggressions on a guy and blow them out
8963242 last year we came in thinking that things were going to be given to us last year because of the high expectations this year people have a chip on their shoulder they know weve got to work for it
8963243 the missed opportunities weve seen and the potential too i think thats the biggest thing weve seen what we couldve done and how easily we could have been a great defense it came down to a play here and there getting off the field making this tackle or that tackle
8963244 we made too many mistakes which cost us games we just shot ourselves in the foot take penn state we just got our butts kicked but in the other games we left things on the field our biggest fear was we were going to beat ourselves and i think we did

8963267 stellaa shes the one who made this a public issue by taking her test results public and giving speeches about her nobility in bringing a downs child into the world
8963268 its the same as it was two months ago when they did the first exam

8963278 steven gerrard has had the operation it was not serious but he will not be available until after the international break
8963279 i have spoken today to fabio capello about the situation he asked me how steven was and it was a good conversation everything was positive between us and i have explained to him the timing and when he will be fit
8963280 we had no option but to have the operation done now there will be another international break soon anyway and we could not wait any longer
8963281 the player had problems and we needed to do it straight away we had no choice fabio capello understands this
8963282 i do not know what response i will get on sunday from villa fans but i will be only concentrating on what goes on out on the pitch
8963283 i do not want to say too much i do not want to analyse too much what has gone on before because we cannot change things now
8963284 i am now only concerned with how to beat villa and how to control barry on the pitch
8963285 do i have a good relationship with martin oneill i dont think so but of course i will shake his hand i am a calm man and i do not have any problems with him about that
8963286 i had a good relationship with martin oneill before this summer and i was surprised at what has been said but i insist that i have not spoken to him since april
8963287 but i do not believe there will be any problem shaking hands we can do it
8963288 we know that barry is a good player very good for them we will try to contain him on the pitch and not talk too much about other things that have happened in the summer
8963289 it is important that we all concentrate on football but i expect barry to do his best for his team
8963290 as for the situation regarding the new stadium it is not something i can do anything about so i prefer to concentrate on the next game and beating aston villa
8963291 we are trying not to think about this we are concentrating on things we can have an effect on it is not good news but we cannot change things
8963292 at the moment i have too many other things to think about riera the champions league aston villa that is the immediate future i am concerned with
8963293 i understand very well our fans and what they may think but they will understand that i must concentrate on the next match and three more points
8963294 i am sure everyone thinks the same way about the stadium delays but it not something i can do anything about my responsibility now is to keep focused and think only of the points and improving
8963295 i want to get back to playing football with city and doing the best i can
8963296 im glad to be given the opportunity to help the club move forward
8963297 i cant say i ever felt i was truly not wanted but when i was at the club chelsea it is a fantastic club fantastic fans
8963298 i can say i gave 110 per cent for them like i always would but i am glad now to leave what was a great experience and try and get to work at home
8963299 from my point of view i am absolutely delighted he is key to what we are trying to do we need to attract top quality players and that is certainly what shaun is
8963300 we have got great plans it is a huge project we are trying to get off the floor here and the need for quality players was obvious this is the start of a great journey we hope
8963301 they have talked to me about the 4 4 game not the carling cup one mistake in the last two minutes meant they lost the premier league
8963302 they also told me they respected some of the tottenham players and at this moment it is important for tottenham not to lose another game
8963303 they want their first three points in the league so we have some problems we know this we need to respect them even more
8963304 if you win a derby it is fantastic when i arrived here some people said to me you need to win three derbies tottenham fulham and west ham
8963305 they said we didnt need to win against the other teams but for me i need to win all the other games against wigan manchester city everyone
8963306 in the last game one or two players played because they wanted to help chelsea but this time it is impossible for one player to play because he feels his foot more than before
8963307 maybe i will be without more than one player if they cannot train tomorrow i will need one or two players to switch position because my midfielders have injuries
8963308 tottenham thought they would have a better start to the season than they have done because they have lost both games
8963309 but i know juande and the players at tottenham they made one or two mistakes in the games before ours but we need to remember this is a big chance for tottenham because it is a derby
8963310 i know more about them than you might think because 11 portuguese players are there when i was in charge of the portugal national team every week i had news about cluj
8963311 we are looking to move a couple out and to bring a couple more in as we have to try to balance the books i imagine it will a bit hectic in the coming days
8963312 harry believes this will be the hardest premier league for many years all clubs are capable of beating one and other
8963313 it is going to be a tough season so it is important to get the balance of the squad right despite the credit crunch the transfer market is very busy
8963314 i am sure lots of our fans were watching the draw at home and are probably still pinching themselves we are in the uefa cup it is great history for the club
8963315 this is a tough competition as there are sides in it who should be in the champions league
8963316 harry takes all competitions seriously and he will send a strong side i am sure of that
8963317 we will have an absolutely packed stadium for the first leg when we make our european debut if we can get into the group stages that would be fantastic
8963318 i think it is going to be difficult because they are top of their league
8963319 they beat barcelona the other night so we will have to do very well at home to start with
8963320 but i am not too concerned about the tie as we have a lot of quality players in our squad
8963321 it is a good draw and hopefully we can do the job in the first leg
8963322 we are just glad to be playing in europe again is is fantastic for the club and fantastic for the fans
8963323 i would think the manager mark hughes is pleased with the tie we played a very good side in denmark and did well to come through that tie we want a winning culture so all competitions are important
8963324 i dont think he has a hope of being a candidate for president
8963325 michigan should rebuild its gubernatorial campaign financing system or shirt the funding to supreme court campaigns

8963340 w hen americans see the iraq war as an entertainment theyre afraid theyre going to be lectured to about how bad the war is or about our politics there
8963341 they really dont have a place in this piece nor do the opnions of ed burns
8963342 what emerges is the picture of an increasingly imprecise and problematic conflict
8963343 but i have no feeling for the numbers at all if i did the wire might have been different
8963344 who wants to be reminded once a week that five years ago the patriots of this great nation respectfully and politely followed our honorable president into a devastating long term no win war overseas
8963345 the scariest showing we had was in front of them when they thought it was what their world was we were very pleased we knew we had done what we were supposed to do
8963346 the first iraq war movie to aspire to something close to documentary realism
8963347 write for the people you are telling the story about convince them that youve got the story right and then everyone else will follow
8963348 are doing what theyre trained for theyre not asking for forgiveness and none need be given
8963349 even possible to make a good movie about a war thats still being fought
8963350 filming the whole fuckin thing like it was the turning point in the fuckin war
8963351 emphasized ideas as well as trying to describe the experience one that went further up the chain of command to the real decision makers
8963352 we should try those people responsible for putting us to war put them in a courtroom because what they did was a crime
8963353 an abdication a moral failure to judge and to acknowledge the horrors that followed
8963354 and say evan i cant tell you what this is about but you have to come with me the ticket will be waiting for you colbert and person two of the marines with whom wright rode into battle will pick you up i would go anywhere they said

8963357 make no mistake this isnt laser guided weapons hitting exactly the right bad guy straight in the ass a lot of people in iraq are dead in the wake of this decision to go to war
8963358 acknowledge who these marines are and what they went through
8963359 our commitment to building a new world class lfc stadium is undiminished
8963360 like many other major development projects in the uk and overseas we are affected by global market conditions and as such work on the project will be delayed in the short term
8963361 we will use this period productively and revisit the plans for the stadium to increase its capacity to 73 000 seats
8963362 he is a very good player but it is not only me that wants him all the coaches in the world do too
8963363 but at the moment what is happening on the pitch is the only important thing for me for my players to play well against tottenham is what matters
8963364 uefa will bring in a control of the management of every individual club
8963365 it is very important for the fans of the competition first and it is very important that every club lives with the resources they have available clubs should not speculate and then after one year they cannot pay the salaries for the next seasons
8963366 hes a player in an ideal world you would not want to lose
8963367 but i just want to make it absolutely clear that it was my decision to sell him we got an offer that i feel was his value hes a fantastic professional and theres no doubt about it villa have got an outstanding player and we have got to move on

8963403 yeah you can almost party all day long so thats pretty special
8963404 it comes from the english concept of high tea sort of early evening event we shortened it to t dance
8963405 there definitely is a different vibe the t dances that start at six are definitely more of a social event
8963406 guys come out and have a cocktail with their friends and then once the sun sets it becomes more of a dance event
8963407 its overall just a big wonderful party its no holds barred you have your dancers your non dancers everyone just dresses up and has a great time
8963408 that just puts an air of suspense to it it just builds the anticipation
8963409 i think sometimes you just need a little gentle reminder every now and again about what has transformed in the club in the last 12 months in regard to young players coming in
8963410 quite frankly i think given our vulnerability of where were going to sit on the ladder we were extremely tired after a very very solid emotional gut busting month
8963411 ive no doubt that there is a psychological let down after big games particularly if youve got a lot of young players
8963412 no question about that because theyre human theyre going to have the frailty of human nature
8963413 finals football in our case is going to be cut throat one loss and youre out one win and you get another chance
8963414 so i believe that we can rebound from this i dont think our players have been that flat for a number of weeks well get back early and perhaps a few blokes might come up im not sure how our injury list is
8963415 we cant afford to procrastinate well have a look at tonights game and see who we should and who we shouldnt take with us into the next game but certainly we wont be spending a lot of time on this game

8963420 we think the apps store is great for iphone users and everyone else
8963421 one of the big challenges is that people dont know that their phones can download apps so the visibility of the iphone store has been great for us weve had an apps store for several years that supports over 100 phones and we have thousands of content titles it is really exciting to see a big brand like apple create awareness in the market for things you can do with your phone

8963497 if you look at world maps for diseases and high mortality rates what you see is africa asia india some of the pacific regions
8963498 were in those areas were in central america south america the pacific islands were in micronesia indonesia in the us we deal with populations that are poor and not getting enough nutrition we have some presence in eastern europe we did a big drive after the war in iraq to help children we sent a million supplements to a big hospital in baghdad

8963500 our cost for purchasing two high dose vitamin a what it takes one capsule every six months is a nickel per child per year
8963501 figuring in transportation training for local distributors and educational materials
8963502 our costs may go up to 15 cents per child per year over six years the span when most children are vulnerable to childhood blindness our total expense is less than a dollar
8963503 nobody is arguing about whether vitamin c will cure scurvy that vitamin a will cure vitamin a deficiency childhood blindness that vitamin d and calcium will cure rickets that prenatal vitamins stop maternal hemorrhaging during childbirth we know that if you provide this product to this person its going to make a difference and if we provide more product to more people its going to make a bigger difference
8963504 the single fact i find most riveting is that the solution to vitamin a deficiency childhood blindness is so close at hand this is not a disease for which there is no known cure this is not a medical enigma that will require billions of dollars and many years of research to resolve this is a problem for which there is a readily available low cost low tech solution
8963505 one quarter of all humanity 1 4 billion people live in absolute poverty

8963508 it seems almost inconceivable but one dollar can actually save someones life lack of basic nutrition causes more deaths each year than heart disease cancer or aids most of these deaths are preventable

8963533 is generally thought to be caused by insufficient potassium in plant leaf tissue which predisposes the foliage to secondary pathogen infection this occurs when extreme wet conditions are present with the roots being soaked for an extended period
8963534 symptoms are seen in the upper third of the plant canopy beginning with yellowing between the plant veins followed by a rapid change to a red orange bronze color
8963535 the affected leaves continue to deteriorate eventually showing brown necrotic lesions and leaf margins
8963536 sixty percent of the total plant potassium is in the cotton boll
8963537 adequate potassium is necessary for fiber and seed development potassium is important for enzyme activation ph balance stomatal control and translocation of photosynthates
8963538 barren plants and those with very little boll load will generally appear unaffected because their demand for potassium and other nutrients is much less
8963539 in addition the plant hormone cytokinin is important in regulating senescence and roots are a major site of cytokinin production as root function decreases so does the production of cytokinin which leads to senescence
8963540 under these conditions plants cannot absorb enough of the nutrient to meet boll demand
8963541 research hs indicated this condition can occur even in fields that contain ample soil potassium
8963542 however it is important to test soil annually to determine seasonal crop needs in addition annual soil testing will provide a good history for tracking levels over time moderate soil potassium levels in fields with a history of premature senescence may signal the need for supplemental fertilizer
8963543 in addition to alternaria on the leaves we are also seeing some bacterial blight on bolls
8963544 this is occurring in full growth bolls and is a result of the cool wet cloudy weather that just passed there are no remedial actions that can be taken except let the field dry out before applying more water in irrigated fields probably a week after the last week of august would be time to start applying water again if you need to mature more bolls
8963545 we are seeing some damaged bolls in several fields in southwestern oklahoma
8963546 research has shown that stink bugs feeding on bolls less than 12 days old can result in abscission when stink bugs attack older bolls they remain on the plant but can cause damage to seed lint staining and yield reductions
8963547 because stink bugs are very mobile scouting them can be difficult
8963548 one scouting method is to examine six row feet at several locations in the field when there is an average of one or more stink bugs per six feet of row you have reached the threshold and both nymphs and adults can inflict damage the best method for determining stink bug infestations is to examine bolls for external and internal damage

8963574 in the first days of her administration palin followed through on a campaign promise to sell the westwind ii jet purchased on a state government credit account by the murkowski administration the state placed the jet for sale on ebay three times in august 2007 the jet was sold for 2 7 million

8963590 i think her selection would be something similar to dan quayle
8963591 dan quayle proved to be sort of an embarrassment as a campaigner being thrust on a national stage like that could be very tough
8963592 now mondale tried to shake things up by going with geraldine ferraro she proved to be a disaster as a running mate and as a campaigner she was absolutely awful and so i just think that it is very risky for mccain to do this but it may be all he has left

8963605 arsenic poisoning is behind many instances of ill health in southern asia including a rising number of cancer cases developing a low cost method of decontaminating ground water that is laced with high levels of arsenic is a key challenge for sustainable agriculture there
8963606 while there are some techniques available for treating relatively small quantities of water there has until now been no viable technology available for decontaminating groundwater on a large scale that can ensure safe irrigation and potable water supply
8963607 this project developed by queens is the only method which is eco friendly easy to use and deliverable to the rural community user at an affordable cost
8963608 from its inception we have had the vital support of indian based stakeholders such as village councils and local financial institutions this has been vital as they are the authorities who monitor the water supply and distribution in rural areas and provide micro credit to the local farmers

8963714 we believe that the current system of benefits for carers is outdated and we recommend the introduction of two distinctive tiers of support for carers offering income replacement support for carers unable to work or working only part time and compensation for the additional costs of caring for all carers in intensive caring roles
8963715 the dwp needs to provide adequate financial support for those who provide care when of working age either by compensating them for the extra costs of caring or if they need to give up work to care through adequate income replacement and pension protection mechanisms
8963716 the current system is enormously complicated and even dwp staff struggle to correctly identify and clearly explain the benefits that carers and their families are entitled to
8963717 it is crucial that the government takes action to boost carers incomes as a matter of urgency
8963718 if the government is serious about reaching an 80 employment rate and empowering people to work it needs to look seriously at how it can remove the barriers that make it very difficult for carers especially those on means tested benefits to engage in the labour market
8963719 this includes 150m over two years so that carers can take short breaks over 6m to support young carers and up to 38m to help them to enter or re enter the job market
8963720 we are working with employers to ensure that carers can have a better balance between their work and caring responsibilities the government is committed to reviewing the care and support system as part of the longer term welfare reform programme
8963721 we welcome this report which is a valuable contribution to the debate we will study the recommendations and respond to them in due course
8963722 we argued for improvements to benefits as part of the governments carers strategy and were bitterly disappointed when none were included
8963723 as well as being insultingly low at just 50 55 per week carers allowance does not recognise carers individual circumstances and discourages them from combining caring with paid work the two tier benefit recommended by the committee would be a major improvement to the current system carers need a separate benefit which recognises that they are not unemployed but are making an important contribution to society
8963724 the committees excellent report lays bare the extent to which carers struggle to access the support they need while carrying out one of the most valuable jobs in our society carers save our health and social care systems billions of pounds and they deserve a better deal in return
8963725 we are delighted that the committee has recognised the potential of care vouchers and we look forward to working with the government and the dwp to implement the committees recommendation
8963726 at the very least the reports conclusions and recommendations should be at the forefront of the current thinking thats going into the green papers on both welfare reform and on social care funding for adult services
8963727 while britains athletes may have won more medals than usual they must remember that they are tainted with the blood of tibetans falun gong practitioners and roman catholic priests

8963729 boris was forced to go to beijing to collect the olympic flag
8963730 i would have told the international olympic committee to put it in the post
8963731 brian coleman is entitled to his views on the olympics which is a matter of taste and political opinion but it is preposterous to suggest that boris johnson was forced to go to beijing
8963732 he rejects absolutely any suggestion that britains athletes are tainted with the blood of tibetans falun gong practitioners and roman catholic priests it is offensive to suggest so when these fine young men and women are not only doing britain proud but are helping to open china to the world and the world to china
8963733 the mayors support for our athletes as they return from beijing has been totally undermined by one of his senior appointments mr coleman has gone out of his way to personally attack insult and disparage the remarkable achievements of the british team
8963734 mr colemans gross insult does nothing but undermine and embarrass the city we should be giving our young athletes all the resources and support possible not rubbishing and going out of our way to put them down
8963735 aside from the fact that peter robinson has no authority to write any letter on any subject on behalf of ofmdfm the office of first and deputy first minister without the agreement of sinn f in people will be amazed that at a time when there are real outstanding issues to resolve mr robinson has the time to play petty politics
8963736 the regional development strategy produced by drd the department of regional development is an accurate reflection of what was agreed at executive level
8963737 the background to this letter is a query made by rejectionist mep jim allister the pattern seems to be jim allister raises an issue and it becomes a dup priority it is weak politics and no way to do business
8963738 this might have nothing to do with the question i admit but from my perspective id explain it this way if a building were on fire and it came down to my having to save either say kirk cameron or spider pedro the guy who scores me my rock cameron would be a left behind potato crisp

8963992 phil and i have always kept in touch throughout the years and i know i will miss his passion and love for ferrari very much
8963993 i think it would make sense because we have all the material with us anyway
8963994 one of my greatest regrets in life is helping the candidacy of gov eddie panlilio
8963995 this is a very good sign that democracy is still alive in the country
8963996 any concrete government program and deliver the needs of the people in the province
8963997 another indication of the loss of confidence in his panlilios administration is the disharmony in the provincial government today
8963998 gross violation of pertinent provisions of the civil service law the anti graft and corrupt practices act and for grave misconduct in office
8963999 the governor need not worry about the recall if he believes that he is doing his job and if he is true to his words
8964000 im also starting to wonder if he is going to abandon his promises to the people like he abandoned the highest calling of his vocation
8964001 these people spelled the difference for panlilios win in 2007
8964002 pasalamat ku king tiwala at suportang bibye yu kanaku napun nakadwa na ngeni at karing daratang pang panaun i thank you for your support yesterday today and tomorrow
8964003 i am not endorsing any candidate but definitely governor panlilio is not the best alternative if the recall election will push through
8964004 he was just trying to make a play i saw the guy dive and hold the ball out but you cant do that that is kind of a cardinal sin you have to protect that ball stanfords bo mcnally on osu wr darrell catchings attempt to score in the last 47 seconds
8964005 cant wait to open the gates were going to knock down the gates in reference to the teams slow starts in the past two seasons
8964006 we had a two point conversion play that would have worked said riley
8964007 they said he catchings reached for the end zone with the ball and got it knocked out before he scored said riley
8964008 i had hoped he had stepped out of bounds thats why i asked for the review
8964009 i was just trying to make a play for our team unfortunately thats not what happened
8964010 went to the well a little too often on the play that stanford strong safety bo mcnally returned 36 yards for a touchdown and a 36 20 cardinal lead with 9 36 to play
8964011 it was pretty evident we could make plays said riley as the fireworks went off above the team locker rooms and the jubilant cardinal players celebrated
8964012 i think well get better said riley of a defense that was out played up front
8964013 guys will learn from this we had some young guys out there some first timers they werent perfect but they fought weve had worse numbers against us i e ian johnson boise state i think well come back from this and well have a good run defense
8964014 this will be a hard game to watch on film because of the opportunities we missed said riley
8964015 but it will be a good game to learn from
8964016 even though they didnt play very good tonight i thought they never quit they came back to make enough plays to give us a chance to win
8964017 oregon state is going to win a lot of games in the pac 10 this year historically they catch their stride after about five games so i think we really got them at the right time
8964018 there was a big difference from last year when we played oregon state i really think they got the better of us physically last year we hung in there with them tonight in that regard
8964019 these new census figures make clear the bush administration s damaging impact on struggling families it is unacceptable that 800 000 more americans are living in poverty including 500 000 more children women working full time earn 78 percent of the salaries earned by men and we still have more than 45 million americans without health insurance including more than eight million children we should be doing everything possible to raise families out of poverty close the pay gap and ensure every american has quality affordable healthcare instead the bush administration has blocked our efforts to expand the childrens health insurance program to cover millions more children and tried to cut vital medicaid services used by more than 400 000 new yorkers we cannot continue with the bush administration s misguided policies that only hurt children and families and i will continue to work with my colleagues in congress to reverse them

8964024 i dont have one a favorite rap song i dont need to listen to music that brings me down with negative thoughts i prefer to listen to music that makes me happy like my new album louis armstrong
8964025 the impact of higher gas prices on drivers accident severity and insurance costs is anything but simple
8964026 our findings indicate that higher average claim costs associated with lighter vehicles have the potential to offset to some extent whatever beneficial effects might occur from less driving
8964027 i do not know what to say about this issue at the moment but i am thinking about it
8964028 i am not answering you because i do not care about you and deliberately ignore you what you say is not at all important that is why i am not replying
8964029 i will not leave you until you tell me what happened and calm down

8964049 another view that is being addressed to the ummah is the concept of fighting the rulers and that through military struggle islam will return to the world stage again this is based upon a particular hadith it has been narrated from many sources including imam muslim that the prophet saw said do not challenge the people of authority unless you see explicit kufr of which you have clear proof from allah from islam ibn kathir in his tafseer states that if the khaleefah reverts to the rule of disbelief he would be fought until he returned to the implementation of islam and the shariah ibn hajr in his fateh al bari also states that if he becomes a kafir or changes the shari ah he should be fought and removed this view is also mentioned in nayl al awtar and supported by imam shawkani that is if the ruler rules by other than the shariah he is fought until he either repents or is removed however that is the only situation that it applies to i e the ruling of a khaleefah who resorts to the kufr ruling and disobedience to allah it does not relate to the khaleefah becoming tyrannical and also does not relate to his personality becoming corrupt in which case obedience to him is binding and the muslims should still pray behind him and fight jihad behind him however these ahadith are not connected to the current situation they are all connected to revolt and rising against the khaleefah and are titled under the subject of khurooj min al khaleefah i e rising against the authority of a khaleefah or an imam the current situation is not that of the khulafaa who used to rule by islam and then turned away from islam the current problem is also not merely related to removing a ruler by killing him rather entire systems of kufr have been implemented over muslims for over 76 years none of the rulers have ever ruled by the shari ah and none of them are khulafaa within a khilafah the systems that they are applying are either monarchies or capitalistic with some sort of democratic framework hence the reality isn t that of removing a bad khaleefah within an islamic state the reality is of uprooting an entire kufr system including it s ruler to again establish dar ul islam the current rulers are not comparable in any way to khulafaa who have introduced one kufr law into the khilafah hence these ahadith which have always been understood in the context of dar ul islam i e where islam is implemented and the muslims possess the security do not apply upon the current situation the reality which they address is that of removing a khaleefah who rules with kufr within the islamic state not that of uprooting an entire kufr system merely by fighting and the only situation that is comparable from the evidences is the establishment of the islamic state for the very first time by the prophet saw and the struggle which he saw went through in order to establish this state and change dar ul kufr to dar ul islam this is the struggle which he saw referred to in the hadith of hamza and as is illustrated in the books of sunnah and seerah as that is the only instance in which a complete system of kufr existed and was changed to a complete system of islam so the matter is regarding the changing of a system not merely a ruler the ahadith of fighting apply to changing a ruler i e a khaleefah who has gone astray not a system only the struggle of the prophet saw in makkah applies to the changing of a system so military struggle is not the method of re establishing the khilafah
8964050 for you is your religion and for me is my religion
8964051 and a faction of the people of the scripture say to each other
8964052 we send them as sheep into a world of wolves only for them to come back to us as an eaten up skeleton
8964053 could the shaikh give us some words of benefit for the blessed month of ramadaan on this fine occasion
8964054 allaah the exalted and most high says in the noble quraan
8964055 o you who believe fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you so that you may become people having taqwaa
8964056 whoever does not abandon falsehood in speech and action then allaah has no need that he should leave his food and drink
8964057 my ummah will continue to be upon good for as long as they hasten to break the fast and delay the pre dawn meal
8964058 my ummah will continue to be upon good for as long as they hasten to pray the maghrib prayer
8964059 my ummah will continue to be upon good as long as they hasten to break the fast
8964060 and the sun has set then the fasting persons fast is broken
8964061 if one of us had climbed onto his camel he would have seen the sun
8964062 my ummah will continue upon good for as long as they hasten to break the fast
8964063 allaah desires ease for you and he does not desire to make things difficult for you
8964064 if one of you hears the call to prayer and the vessel is in the hand of one of you then let him not put it down until he fulfils his need from it
8964065 if one of you hears the call to prayer and the vessel
8964066 if one of you hears the call to prayer and the vessel is in his hand then let him not put it down until he fulfils his need from it
8964067 and eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes clear to you from the black thread of the night
8964068 because he gives the adhaan in order to awaken the person who is sleeping and so that the person who wishes to eat the pre dawn meal can do so so eat and drink until ibn umm maktoon gives the adhaan
8964069 he frowned and turned away that the blind man came to him
8964070 if one of you hears the call to prayer and the vessel is in his hand then let him not put it down until he has fulfilled his need from it
8964071 allaah desires to make things easy for you and he does not desire to make things difficult for you
8964072 and that you should complete the number of days and that you should glorify allaah by mentioning takbeer for his having guided you and that you should be thankful
8964073 if someone hears the adhaan and has some food in his mouth then he must spit it out
8964074 o people of the book do not exceed the limits in your religion and do not say anything about allaah except the truth
8964075 beware of ghuluww exceeding the limits in the religion because those who came before you were destroyed by their exceeding the limits in their religion
8964076 if one of you hears the call to prayer whilst the vessel is in his hand then let him not put it down until he has completed his need from it
8964077 allaah loves that his allowances be acted upon just as he loves that his prescribed duties be carried out
8964078 just as he hates that disobedience to him be committed
8964079 allaah loves that his allowances be acted upon just as he loves that his prescribed duties be carried out

8964095 esto significa que la mosca debe integrar la informaci n visual de sus ojos que le dice de d nde procede la amenaza con la informaci n mecanosensorial de sus patas que le indica c mo moverse para alcanzar la postura adecuada antes de emprender el vuelo
8964096 se transforma en un patr n apropiado de movimientos en patas y cuerpo antes de echar a volar
8964097 es mejor no dirigirse al punto en el que se encuentra la mosca sino un poco m s hacia donde se cree que va a saltar cuando vea venir el cazamoscas

8964115 mandatory community service sucks in much that is private and diverse and spits out an excessively homogenized version of the good a version that would come with a government seal of approval its probably not an accident that many american groups who tend to favor greater government largesse are relatively stingy in their own donations to charity

8964136 the speed with which opinions have changed in santa barbara county as gasoline prices have climbed has been astonishing the vote there reinforces at the local level a shift evident in national polls and in the delicate willingness of democratic leaders like senator barack obama the presumptive presidential nominee and the house speaker nancy pelosi of california to open the door to limited coastal drilling

8964140 it is not an easy draw they are a good side the portuguese league is a tough one with teams like fc porto sporting lisbon and benfica but vitoria finished third last season so they cant be bad

8964167 promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family
8964168 ours is a promise that says government should do that which we cannot do for ourselves
8964169 that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend
8964170 if socrates had engaged in an interminable presidential campaign in a media drenched age perhaps he too would have come to seem banal but the fact that obama lost nine of the final 14 primaries might have something to do with the fact that when he descends from the ether to practicalities he reprises liberalisms most shopworn nostrums obamas rhetorical extravagances are inversely proportional to his details the diminished enthusiasm of some voters hitherto receptive to his appeals might have something to do with the seepage of reality from his rhetoric
8964171 the recent death of aleksandr solzhenitsyn should make us recall what he said when he was awarded the nobel prize the timid civilized world has found nothing with which to oppose the onslaught of a sudden revival of barefaced barbarity other than concessions and smiles what would a barack obama presidency mean other than more concessions and broader smiles while iran goes nuclear

8964177 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

8964181 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
8964182 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
8964183 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
8964184 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
8964185 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
8964186 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
8964187 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
8964188 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
8964189 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
8964190 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
8964191 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
8964192 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
8964193 weve been able to pick things that offer the biggest value
8964194 a strong indication of the macro environment getting a lot worse
8964195 i woke up this morning and had about a 3 second flash of excitement in my gut
8964196 we are very aware our hands are as full as they can be to handle him and rest of that offense
8964197 we havent done as much prep work on them as we would normally do because of the staff change
8964198 that happens when youve got a lot of things going on as a coach
8964199 he took a significant amount of cyanide he either drank it or he ate it
8964200 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
8964201 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
8964202 despite this sluggish u s economy the general demand picture is better than it was post 9 11
8964203 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees
8964204 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
8964205 the reality is and i dont want to diminish this the industry is going to have to cover its costs
8964206 if there are fewer flights that wont bother me but if flights are really expensive i just wont go or ill go by myself instead of bringing my son and husband
8964207 and then youre good to go you dont have to worry about that
8964208 a very very small number of people would have purchased tickets for travel in september or thereafter before the flights were taken out of the fall schedule in may and june of this year
8964209 i think if oil prices continue to go down you will hear calls for relaxation of fuel surcharges but that doesnt mean they wont hike base airfares
8964210 i dont think most people in every aspect of their trip will notice a difference
8964211 if there is a silver lining it may be that as a result of fewer overall operations they may see better on time performance

8964214 i remember his speed of play was miles ahead of everyone
8964215 he was noticeably faster than everyone on the field and also was a great finisher
8964216 we cannot take sole credit for the advancement of edsons soccer career
8964217 we did provide him with some exposure to get his name out there as we try to do with all of our players
8964218 the league is constructed in a setting where you get to see the adaptation of players
8964219 they get familiar with the traveling aspects of the sport as well as the extreme level of competition that is out there in this league you have to bring your best to every game if you want a chance at winning
8964220 but for those ten minutes i wished he wasnt as good as he was
8964221 the pdl gives players a national perspective that can really help in all aspects of their game
8964222 the league allows the players to stay on top of their game and provides them with great competition during the summer
8964223 but a wins a win we would have liked to do a lot of things better defensively than we did we are in no way satisfied we have to do a lot of things better
8964224 i was trying to make a play for the team but unfortunately it didnt work out that way
8964225 it didnt happen i have to learn from this and try to make better decisions
8964226 it feels like i didnt play football in two years
8964227 it feels good to be out there i picked up where i left off now just keep it going
8964228 it will be a hard game to watch on film because of all the mistakes well learn from this
8964229 hes up in it and hes running it doesnt take him a long time to get to full speed he has those instincts you come out of the crib with ive seen him in two games and hes been darn good
8964230 you cant feel the pleasure of the treasure without pressure
8964231 some of the girls in the movie did their first anal scenes here for others it was their first scene on camera of any kind either way everyone ended up taking it like a champ thats why i love my burningangel girls

8964234 i thoroughly enjoy this programme i sing along every week
8964235 they keep talking about hip hop dancing without actually saying what it is
8964236 in the 1930s a similar humming sound was heard in the air in yorkshire and i felt the programme should have discussed if there was a possible connection
8964237 i would like the bbc reporters speaking from the actual spot where soldiers are killed in afghanistan and not sitting miles away in a hotel
8964238 the weather presenter was heavily pregnant which annoyed me immensely instead of standing there looking as if she was about to give birth she should just go home and look after herself someone needs to tell her to stop being so silly
8964239 gabby logan is a poor quality presenter she is too ugly to look at please get rid of her
8964240 jeremy paxman referred to hugh laurie as a comedian on the show i feel that this was inaccurate as hugh laurie is also an actor
8964241 scotland should not be included in the weather forecasts they have their own parliament after all
8964242 someone needs to tell her to stop being so silly
8964243 i looked around the internet for a few luxurious minutes and vastly enjoyed cranmers blog which i intend to read more regularly in future
8964244 his grace investigates with moral seriousness and intellectual rigour bringing some refreshing common sense to some of the touchiest subjects in british politics
8964245 i take advice in matters spiritual and religious from the ghost of archbishop cranmer his blog is a role model for niche blogs of all descriptions thoughtful erudite and provocative
8964246 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
8964247 this means that from a basic science point of view cafe2as2 offers a clean model system that seems to encompass all of the salient features of these compounds structural magnetic and superconducting phase transitions and that its behavior can be tuned with pressure
8964248 this is a very exciting discovery that may help guide the way to understanding this new family of superconductors
8964249 i was able to theoretically confirm that planned design changes to the current bifilar fault current limiter being developed by siemens and american superconductor would decrease ac losses in the system
8964250 my calculations are good news for the future of the device
8964251 we are working on getting a second cell phone increasing the staff to 45 drivers and co pilots and this process will lead to the second van
8964252 there seemed to be such an overwhelming response last semester
8964253 they did a good job of demonstrating that there was demand for another van and that the presence of steer clear was important
8964254 drivers need to be able to handle stressful situations and cooperate with campus police
8964255 the most complex building the college has ever undertaken to build
8964256 a consistent reliable and transparent set of procedures when conducting risk assessments
8964257 outlines the components that should be included in a risk assessment and provides for improved public access to rulemaking information
8964258 issuing administering or enforcing any rule regulation or requirement derived from
8964259 prohibiting the department of labor s secret rule act of 2008
8964260 in order to gain valuable outside input and in the interests of full transparency and accountability to the public
8964261 i dont think so i think what we did was to respond to a situation that was unconscionable
8964262 when interim college president taylor reveley came on he wanted to focus five years out on the important things facing the university and financial issues were high on that list
8964263 the corporate sector is ahead in terms of information collection
8964264 the college has worked to get more student focused business in williamsburg
8964265 i think the future of the college is directly related to the economic environment around the college of william and mary we want to foster a diverse economy more entry level opportunities for graduates and internships for students
8964266 we need a stronger link between william and mary and the city of williamsburg
8964267 its an important time for this position given the current state of the budget news in richmond and the need for the college to develop a strategy for greater financial sustainability
8964268 at the state level it is very clear that the state legislature has pressing economic challenges the ability to sustain support of higher education is a challenge the college is indebted to the state for function and operations the state is unlikely to contribute more than 20 percent on operating budget and we must find a solution
8964269 in september we will start thinking systematically about the planning process
8964270 my goal is to put a continuous strategic planning process in place that becomes the normal way of how the college does its business

8964283 theres lots of stuff we can learn by studying the past one thing we cant learn though is how much the future will resemble the past
8964284 i have a balanced portfolio made up entirely of 4 and 5 star funds
8964285 theres been a lot of speculation about the situation around the club as were all aware and maybe i needed to reassure people that actually whats written and whats reported about the club at the moment is not quite what the actual situation is
8964286 it was a case of just making shaun and his dad and his advisors aware that weve got great plans here its a huge project that were trying to get off the floor
8964287 this is the start of a great journey we hope
8964288 were trying to pursue other targets as well which will complement the good players that we already have here but the key to it was to get shaun back through the door and back where he belongs
8964289 shaun is certainly one of those players who benefits from playing week in week out
8964290 that will be a positive for him and he will benefit and i think possibly in the end england will benefit
8964291 thats our aim we want him back playing international football on a regular basis
8964292 thats all ill be doing that wont be strange at all
8964293 ive spoken to the manager and ive no problem giving 100 for aston villa and that will be starting against liverpool on sunday
8964294 all i can do is give 100 for the club that is all the fans will want to see anyway i am sure that will be enough
8964295 it has been a long summer there was continuous speculation but i feel i am strong enough mentally and ill be fine with it all now
8964296 i always take things a season at a time this speculation happened at the end of last season and it has been decided that ill be staying at villa
8964297 ill take this season now concentrate on that and hopefully we can improve on last season
8964298 do i feel like ive been hung out to dry over what has happened that is what the football business is all about
8964299 i think david moyes is just looking as we are for loans
8964300 theres a shortage of money out there in the world at the moment it seems
8964301 although sunderland have signed a few players most clubs have not really been spending like they used to and i think they will be spending less and less
8964302 i can see it getting tighter wages have gone up expenses are higher lots of people involved in businesses are struggling
8964303 and clubs are selling players who not long ago you wouldnt expect them to sell
8964304 they are players you thought they wanted to keep so that they could push on and push on and build
8964305 suddenly it has gone the opposite way and one or two other clubs have come in and taken the opportunity to strengthen
8964306 for me as i keep saying it will be the toughest premier league ever look at the other sides
8964307 sunderland are a possible top 10 team this season stoke have just come up but they will be strong they showed that in beating villa
8964308 but certain clubs will still spend certain owners have mega money
8964309 our owner has been fantastic and given us great backing but he knows hes got to balance the books
8964310 if you buy people youve got to sell others to pay for them thats how it should be really
8964311 at pompey i suppose that in the long term weve also got to finance a new training ground and in time a new stadium as well
8964312 i know for a fact that i havent been given the nod
8964313 im disgusted that people players media would think that nick faldo would be that unprofessional
8964314 its pathetic that people can even think thats the case
8964315 nicks a professional hes been a professional the last 30 years of his career and hes not going to start changing now
8964316 i told him basically that my decision is to stay here and play and i got the best answer i could have possibly got off a captain which was youve got to do whats right for you
8964317 i just hit the starter button and it didnt work
8964318 the post american world is naturally an unsettling prospect for americans but it should not be this will not be a world defined by the decline of america but rather the rise of everyone else

8964488 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8964489 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8964490 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8964491 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8964492 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8964493 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8964494 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8964495 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8964496 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8964497 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8964498 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8964499 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8964500 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8964501 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8964502 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8964503 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8964504 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8964505 they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8964506 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8964507 what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes
8964508 because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
8964509 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8964510 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8964511 let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8964512 i dont care where the system is i just want it to run

8964568 like the antic shrines and alters they construct in their flower beds these eclectic havens are in a very real sense churches where people find faith both in themselves and in their neighbors
8964569 if you live in an unrealistic world then you can say everything should be a community garden

8964578 typically online communities are criticized for promoting disembodied and immaterial connections too often political campaigns that may once have mobilized a street action or something directly physical have instead turned into a cascade of emails and online petitions but as the remarkable participation in the february 2003 global anti war demonstrations revealed the same electronic communities can network themselves to produce an unprecedented public demonstration
8964579 an unfolding potential can and does erupt in the most surprising places seemingly simple and limited but also embodying deeper aspirations for a more profound transformation
8964580 i have a feeling we can put this story to bed
8964581 i think with the purchase of pavlyuchenko the idea of arshavin moving to london no longer exists
8964582 the only team who are interested in arshavin at the moment is valencia
8964583 the feeling amongst us is the same that it always has been we form a team and he forms part of the team for which the feeling is equal what robinho does is up to him
8964584 he does not have any reason to ask our pardon it is a decision between him and the club

8964605 miss buffalo chip isnt a beauty contest in the traditional sense its a relatively debauched topless and sometimes bottomless multiday contest where women dance jiggle and reportedly even perform blow jobs on bananas for the titillation of the spectators and john mccain offered up his 54 year old wife as a contestant

8964632 i finshed high school when i was almost 19 turned 19 a month later because my mom had me held back in preschool because they thought i wasnt ready for kindergarten

8964639 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8964640 nigeria is never entering into any agreement with iran for any matter that has to do with weapons
8964641 there shouldnt be a misunderstanding between exploration or uses of energy to provide power and the uses of energy for weapons
8964642 so that our relationship with iran will not be misconstrued by nigerians and the entire international community
8964643 we not only consider it irans inalienable right but also the nigerians so that they could use this clean source of energy and nobody can limit the use of knowledge anywhere in the world
8964644 yes we wrote a letter to the security council in 2003 saying were responsible for the acts of our employees our people but it doesnt mean that we did it in fact
8964645 what can you do without writing that letter you will not be able to get rid of the sanction i admit we played with the words we had to we had to there was no other solution
8964646 i think they the families were very greedy and they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
8964647 the position with them it was very terrible and it was very materialistic and it was very greedy and they were asking for money and more money and more money and more money
8964648 and they were talking just about money money money money money
8964649 i dont think that poor guy is behind that sophisticated operation im sure that that poor guy is not sophisticated and clever and capable enough to carry out that job
8964650 i spoke to manchester united director david gill and he always said that the club did not want to sell ronaldo
8964651 i asked him about it obviously because i thought we could do something
8964652 it was the same with villarreal president fernando roig when i asked about santi cazorla he said no and that was that
8964653 with cazorla we could have signed him if we had wanted to but we did not want to pay his buy out clause five days before the transfer window closes
8964654 that was why we did not sign him although villarreal have seen things differently
8964655 in the case of villa they offered him to us for 80m and he was never part of our plans for that amount i do not understand why that turned out like that
8964656 it did not appear that kak s position needed strengthening according to the coaches i did not enter into it
8964657 i have to say that it was a possibility to sign kak this summer but i was told that we did not need him now
8964658 he may have cost 100m but i do not think that would have been the price but those in charge told me not to look into it
8964659 personally i think saying he wanted to leave was a mistake and that it was a problem with him i think his representatives advised him badly and they confused him
8964660 but once it had been said it was my job to defend the interests of the club in the best way that i could
8964661 we did not consider selling him even if cristiano had joined robinho was not going it would not have been necessary to sell anyone
8964662 i have said before that all this came down to a problem of communication more than anything else
8964663 the media become involved and then we wanted to sort it out with the player and his club but we became spectators and had no role to play in it all
8964664 we received the news that player wanted to come to madrid but as i said throughout it was down to manchester united to say whether or not they would sell him
8964665 the player still has a contract with his club and there is nothing more that we can do i am not thinking about next summer now because i do not know what could happen
8964666 we just do not know if he will end up playing here or not i hope he can but that is another matter
8964667 there was no call from ronaldo saying he was not coming i do not want to give the impression that we interfered in any way with all this because we did not
8964668 the relationship between manchester united and real madrid is magnificent still although it did bother me that their manager made some comments but we will remain friends
8964669 hey cameron wanted to talk to you he asked me to tell you because we share the house he figured i could reach you
8964670 come on you knew it was going to happen sooner or later couldnt you smell it the new pungent odor
8964671 fine i was just the messenger anyway you can go talk to cameron yourself and you know i could have turned out worse murderer
8964672 dont be that upset havent you ever wanted to talk with another
8964673 you were born to protect and guide thats what youre going to do besides this is the last time so rejoice
8964674 well no but i think id still be able to do my job david
8964675 you had to do it too david and your terms were worse
8964676 i must be going your partner is awakening tomorrow arianas place
8964677 davey im sorry i fell asleep ive been so tired lately
8964678 its this strawberry lotion stuff it smells really good smell
8964679 one hundred flys always comes down to finishes and some would say cavics finish was it was at that point 50 50 whether you take another stroke or you take a glide
8964680 you see phelpsy took another stroke he cavic took a glide and obviously phelps arms are coming over at a faster pace he phelps made the right decision and the other guy made the wrong decision
8964681 but if he phelps had made the other decision he might not have been as lucky and he might have come away with a second and he would have come away with equalling spitzs record
8964682 im not saying he didnt deserve it im saying he did everything he could do to win those golds and he came away with it but at the same time there were little mistakes by other people that allowed him to do that
8964683 i guess what else is left to do for him except come down and win races he hasnt won before
8964684 when you are the greatest swimmer ever i guess you can afford to do that
8964685 hes accomplished so much already he wants to accomplish more he better bring his a game because us sprint boys are a different league and we are not going go easy on him
8964686 representatives from microsoft aided joe in swiftly resolving the issue
8964687 the second leg will be away they beat barcelona the other night
8964688 they are very passionate fans so we will have to do very well at home to start with
8964689 im not saying im concerned but we have to be careful it will be a competitive tie for sure
8964690 i think the talent is there the quality is there its just a question of confidence the new players settling in
8964691 it is a tough competition as there are sides in it who should be playing in the champions league
8964692 harry takes all competitions seriously and he will need a strong side we have not got the biggest squad so it is important to get the balance right
8964693 they were all tough opponents and benfica is probably the best we could have got because at least if we do go out it would be to a big club
8964694 i made a choice to run a junior team in quebec city and because of that i didnt have time to go to the bell centre
8964695 i would have like to have gone to some events like the jersey retirements of bob gainey and serge savard i would have liked to go see ex rempart
8964696 its the same as it was two months ago when they did the first exam
8964697 its not worse which is important now the thing is its not better either and it seems like the only way to repair it completely is arthroscopic surgery
8964698 my plan was to be part of the olympic games and i knew that if i suffered from pain they would have to operate this isnt something that took me by surprise
8964699 ahora el juez deber informar en un plazo de 30 d as de mi solicitud de condena a la defensa de blanco
8964700 why should i cop one what reason do i have
8964701 in the spirit of the west we can move forward but its going to take leaders who are strong enough to stand up for whats right bold enough to bring new ideas and sweep away the worst of washingtons old ways
8964702 this is our moment to change the course of history
8964703 its going to be very good for udall for fundraising
8964704 hes got a lot of people who regularly give money to democratic candidates
8964705 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8964706 i know this is being thought a lot about in washington and at the white house and discussed and i suspect they will monitor it carefully and figure out what to do
8964707 fire dancing circuses and 3 000 person light saber war
8964708 look jordan i want people to visit this amazing place but you guys make it very difficult and uncomfortable and then nobody will come and that hurts everyone
8964709 this transaction represents further progress in the execution of our five point plan and provides additional financial resources to support our holding company and core u s mortgage insurance business
8964710 entiendo que no soy el candidato m s probable para este puesto no encajo en el prototipo habitual y no he pasado mi carrera en los salones de washington
8964711 estoy ante ustedes por que en am rica se est sintiendo algo
8964712 lo que las personas negativas no entienden es que estas elecciones nunca han sido sobre mi son sobre vosotros
8964713 este momento estas elecciones son nuestra oportunidad para mantener en el siglo xxi la promesa americana con vida
8964714 no es a causa de que a john mccain no le importe es por que john mccain no lo entiende
8964715 la semana que viene en minnesota el mismo partido que les ha tra do dos legislaturas de george bush y dick cheney pedir a este pa s una tercera
8964716 el 4 de noviembre debemos levantarnos y decir ocho es suficiente
8964717 a john mccain le gusta decir que seguir a bin laden hasta las puertas del infierno pero no llegar ni a la cueva donde vive
8964718 que dice acerca de su juicio el que est de acuerdo con bush el 90 de las veces
8964719 si john mccain quiere tener un debate sobre qui n tiene el temperamento el juicio de servir como el pr ximo comandante en jefe ese es un debate para el que estoy preparado ha asegurado
8964720 somos el partido de roosevelt somos el partido de kennedy as que no me dig is que los dem cratas no defendemos este pa s
8964721 como comandante en jefe nunca vacilar a defender esta naci n pero s lo enviar a nuestras tropas al peligro con una misi n clara y un compromiso sagrado de darles el equipamiento que necesitan en la batalla y el cuidado y las ventajas que merecen cuando vuelven a casa
8964722 terminar la lucha contra al qaeda y los talib n en afganist n
8964723 no se que tipo de vidas cree john mccain que tienen las celebridades pero esa ha sido la m a
8964724 esos son mis h roes sus abuelos esas son las historias que me formaron y por ellos pretendo ganar estas elecciones
8964725 there could not have been a better place for me to start my journey of showing the film tff is an intimate film lovers festival and here i will know how it resonates with the audiences
8964726 the bar is very high here with the likes of mike leigh and david fincher showing their films and also films that were awarded in cannes so in many ways this is a good beginning to the litmus test
8964727 abba felt that people are turning away from classical music towards pop music and wanted to promote classical music among the newer generation to fulfill his wishes i am trying to create more awareness regarding classical music and instruments as it will be a fitting tribute to his memory
8964728 right from the days of the great depression era in the usa it has been seen that if inflation is high the expense on entertainment goes up
8964729 besides inflation the other challenges that the entertainment sector faces are quality content difficulty in increasing ticket prices and contracting peoples costs
8964730 there definitely has been a reduction in the occupancy rate and the footfalls have gone down adding to the woes of distributors and exhibitors
8964731 the past six months have been slow for the film industry but it will be premature to attribute that to inflation
8964732 there have been just three hits out of the 33 films released
8964733 every year we expect a 7 per cent increment so we hike the ticket rates accordingly
8964734 most of the films which are already in production will not be impacted but the ones that are going to be launched will require a bit of budget reshuffling
8964735 as the pressure on spending on leisure is felt more at that level
8964736 not really as its just a small phase one or two blockbusters will bring back the crowds and the enthusiasm to the theatres
8964737 the story of this film happens on a wednesday anupam kher plays the police commissioner and he narrates a case that is unregistered and has no mention in any police record the greatest thing of working on a wednesday was working with a great set of actors anupam kher and naseeruddin shah are veterans and having them in my film was great the ease with which i got them on board was unbelievable i just sent them the copies of the script and they were raring to go like all contemporary thrillers a wednesday is sans any interruptions in the form of on screen songs the format of the story didnt have any scope for singing and dancing everything happens within a span of four hours and even this period is condensed into a two hour screenplay the film has a good story and i felt it needed to be told it talks about the choices people make during testing times in this case during an act of terrorism
8964738 this is the best phase of my career and work comes first
8964739 the video released in the year 1988 but the memories are as fresh even after 20 years
8964740 working with cameron diaz and ashton kutcher was a case of chemistry which is so important to this movie on one level it was the chemistry between them and then their chemistry with me we all needed to get used to the idea that we shared a sense of humour because if we didnt then we not be able to do a comedy film together both cameron and ashton have a lot of similarities they are both very attractive and very funny which is a really unique combination honestly there are not that many people out there who can do what they do so when we reviewed the idea of putting them together it felt like casting two actors who were evenly matched essentially the visual appeal of what happens in vegas comes from its contrast between new york and las vegas they are two of the most famous cities in america visually people know images of vegas and of new york city and it felt like a great opportunity to play with those this is a fun movie filled with lots of great comic actors and a stunning visual appeal fingers crossed ill be hoping it hits the jackpot in entertaining its audience
8964741 mobile navigation caught on in europe in 2003 and the us followed in 2006 it is now asia pacifics turn
8964742 even after our maps were available on yahoo it was difficult to prove that good maps existed and indians will actually want to pay for navigation
8964743 it is like selling shoes on an island where everyone is used to being barefoot if you are able to sell the concept you have a huge untapped market
8964744 we have seen a very good start for personal navigation devices since we introduced them with highend cars in december last year after security system it is the best selling electronic gadget in high end cars
8964745 you can compare it to cameras most of us still pack a digital camera on our holiday even though we are carrying our cellphones equipped with a camera
8964746 to begin with we are restricted to giving driving instructions later when operators join in we could combine navigation features with location based services to come up with ads according to the area you are currently in
8964747 there has been zero advance booking so far through our ticket booking counters at the theatre for all the three new films
8964748 mumbai meri jaan is about bomb blast a topic which is not much appreciated by the audience any longer
8964749 in recent times we had very big releases and compared to that the demand for the new films is quite weak
8964750 all the three films are of different genres and so it will be unfair to compare them
8964751 it the performance of the israeli rhythmic gymnastic team ranks alongside the israeli football teams 1976 olympic quarterfinal as israels greatest ever achievement in an olympic team event
8964752 its great it shows that our music bollywood in particular is so popular
8964753 whenever commercial music is played our critics rip it apart
8964754 but the best way to make indian music popular in the world is through commercial numbers
8964755 we sometimes underestimate ourselves indian film music had always been a fusion one right from the days of maestro pankaj mullick when indian classical ragas were played on western orchestra
8964756 i have been feeding strays since i was very young and continued the habit when i came to mumbai four years ago i do not feed them in my colony as the residents do not like it but have someone who feeds them outside the compound
8964757 from a brood of about five puppies she was the only one who would be left lying around as she could not walk i was so touched by her plight that i brought her home
8964758 if you want to make it here you have to put in that much of effort like go out and meet people and generally be on the move i was very na ve and thought that work would come to me sitting at home
8964759 it is a brief but very interesting part i will be seen in trousers shirt and blazer and specs for the first time
8964760 i am on the lookout for land outside mumbai if other animal activists want to help its fine but i am all set to finance it on my own
8964761 aishwarya discontinued nakshatra because she had some conditions and the company did not come to terms with this so she called it off it is false news that she lost out the endorsement to katrina kaif
8964762 a santoor ad featuring saif ali khan might seem ambiguous to some but no advertiser will pay a celebrity a large sum of money without considering the outcome
8964763 people identify with celebrities easily and as a result are able to indentify with the product that celebrity endorses
8964764 i divided the songs into five types based on where they appear in the movie and what they meant
8964765 when i started my research in 2006 item songs had become a phenomenon every movie had them and so it was but natural to study them in relation to cultural studies
8964766 my examiner during the viva even thought item numbers are empowering as the yallow other girls to express their sexuality too
8964767 at the end of the day item songs are there to generate curiosity about the movie if it was very liberating why is the heroine not depicted doing them it is always a random girl who has no link with the story who does the item numbers they are never shown having a family or friends
8964768 it was an interesting topic in terms of culture studies and we welcomed it
8964769 many of our students are researching movies directors and such topics we are always expanding the scope for english studies
8964770 and i love to travel the show put all my three loves together
8964771 we just pack the couch when we travel and can set up anywhere in half hour
8964772 when there are 15 television channels covering something everything is un exclusive
8964773 i dont like the invasion of privacy for me it is all about the celebration of the personality
8964774 i expected him to be blunt and straightforward but he was also so gentle and so soft
8964775 yet salman was so focussed on me that day i learnt from him that when you have a job to do you should be focussed only on that
8964776 i play the owner of a lifestyle store who has lived life im a sort of mentor for prachi desais character
8964777 we girls play groupies and the guys did all the hard work
8964778 i know how to play the harmonium but im musically challenged
8964779 i was travelling so i missed the trials i told abhishek kapoor that i will see it at the premiere
8964780 we wanted her to be remembered for her life not for the way she died we also wanted to bring some tranquility in mumbai which is a city where there is stress on every corner
8964781 on the one hand shes a diva on the other shes the embodiment of the serene mother
8964782 i couldnt refuse i was moved ive told him that as long as im alive he can never say that he doesnt have a mother
8964783 it isnt the audiences fault its the artistes job to make listeners comfortable
8964784 were all part of the same universal soul so if i sing from the soul to you youll understand my music
8964785 you can only do something well if it brings out some feeling within you if you want to take a picture of a scene and it does not inspire you how will you get a good photograph
8964786 people get scared of our classical music because they see all these acrobatics of notes and rhythms thats not all there is to it im a straightforward person what you see is what you get that comes across in my music
8964787 they are holding a meeting what objections have you got
8964788 why does it bother you whether i enter politics or not mind your own business
8964789 eppo varuvaen eppadi varuvaen theriyaadhu vara vaendiya naerathula varuvaen was a dialogue written by somebody i just uttered that
8964790 in these challenging times for the toronto film industry we needed a boost we hope filmport can play a role in putting toronto where it belongs back on top
8964791 this way i monitor the script acting editing and see that there is no gap between the creatives and shooting i am essentially a technician who believes that the director is the captain of the ship
8964792 secondly its balajis own show and ekta has always given me great characters till date so i was sure if she thought i was fit for this then i had to do it lastly i play a completely positive character which is what i wanted to do after kayaamath
8964793 we are working in the same show but are not seen as a couple maybe later if the track shapes up with us being paired together audiences will see our chemistry on screen till then it will be just nice to be working on the same sets and having a hassle free time
8964794 music is meant to touch the soul of the listener and aspire for a fine harmony between tradition and modernity that is in sync with the sensibilities of a global audience
8964795 i have received lots of awards in my career par yeh queen wala prestige khaas hai and thats because i am the first asian not just the first indian to receive the mbe another honour i treasure is the one conferred on me by the canadian prime minister and after all this it is especially thrilling ke ghar mein aake bhi rajiv gandhi award jaisa bada sammaan mila
8964796 i have spread not just punjabi folk but also indian culture in 36 countries for over two decades
8964797 i have presented bhangra live and bally sagoo began with a remix of my song
8964798 i concentrate on shows when i perform in spain italy or anywhere else it is because they want to hear india ka music people respect you only if you love your own culture my style is consistent it will seem as if i went to england just two years ago its pure desi gehu indian wheat ka music
8964799 so many musicians are using the bhangra pop name but sometimes it is not bhangra at all the media is responsible for spreading such myths
8964800 non punjabis like it because the words and beats sound good but we think yeh kya ho rahaa hai these people are not even familiar with our music the correct grammar and the right pronunciation
8964801 my song jind maahi was used in bend it like beckham but indians have this belief that unless you do a film aap itne bade nahin ho so what if you have performed in buckingham palace
8964802 i have my band of ten people called the golden star i compose write the words and sing and they are my musicians
8964803 i think for everybody it signalled the end of the madness
8964804 it rained 12 times a day people were getting sick
8964805 it comes back to what we are satirising the actors and the hollywood system what do you do to be taken seriously
8964806 for the 14 3 million americans with cognitive disabilities such arguments may be problematic
8964807 being negative is a recursive function that will get invoked by someone else
8964808 we can do this if you want but i trust where youre going with the character
8964809 if dark knight failed to perform way above expectations this would have been a decidedly down summer
8964810 they may not hesitate for one second to spend 10 bucks on a movie ticket to go see the dark knight but some of these other films they may say oh im going to wait or im going to be a little bit more careful with my spending
8964811 i had braces and glasses and a big curly fro
8964812 i wasnt necessarily too active in getting into the social crowd so i definitely understand not fitting in
8964813 even though she doesnt need it anymore its kept her from having to show the world her true self
8964814 its been a very different experience to be on my own
8964815 after being compared to jay leno for so long you dont think of yourself that way
8964816 como dije a los trabajadores de la corporaci n no se trata de un cambio de s mbolo sino del s mbolo de un cambio
8964817 era necesario dinamizar la percepci n que los ciudadanos ten an de rtve
8964818 el a o y medio de trabajo de la corporaci n no ha sido en balde y hemos conseguido acelerar la marcha de tve
8964819 dinamizar la percepci n que los ciudadanos tienen de rtve

8964821 se debe al magn fico trabajo que han desempe ado los profesionales de esta casa en pek n
8964822 tve no fue l der a pesar de que no exist an a n cuatro ni lasexta
8964823 las audiencias no son un fin sino una consecuencia del trabajo bien hecho

8964825 en rtve es tendremos el portal de deportes m s importante de espa a
8964826 why live in a fools paradise when you know what the audience wants people are no more watching channels but shows the audience follows stories and characters the paradigm is still in the space of home it is not wise to be brave and do radical stuff
8964827 ruby is hugely aspirational and determined to be a successful story the value system is important to her but she will not mind using a different modus operandi to live on her own terms
8964828 but its differently coloured and textured it is a story that has not been seen on television in recent times rubi is a girl next door who is a representative persona of small town girls
8964829 it is a great show with good production values its not a medical thriller but a show with all normal emotional elements though there is suspense and mystery
8964830 it is not important to be different but it is very important to be good
8964831 but we are proud of our shows they have been appreciated we have been making engaging content and traction is growing for our weekday band now we are taking the journey forward with the two new bi weeklies and there is lot more to come in coming months
8964832 even star plus and zee experience swings of 30 to 40 grps but it doesnt get noticed but a decline of 5 to 10 grps in our case appears humongous
8964833 it is a finite story and will go on for about seven to eight months
8964834 these are good looking cards but im cheaper and more effective than this card because i believe in what im advertising and this card doesnt believe in anything and i probably wont be thrown in the trash can
8964835 umm i am sort of offended by this law here that says i cant speed i sort of like speeding and it offends me that you dont so down with speed limits
8964836 when you are part of a family that comes up with a concept sometimes youre the last to admit that it needs to be changed
8964837 all antipsychotics are associated with an increased risk of stroke and the risk might be higher in patients receiving atypical antipsychotics than those receiving typical antipsychotics
8964838 more than twice as great among people with dementia compared with those without
8964839 men who use heated car seats could be unwittingly putting their fertility at risk
8964840 the frequent use of a heated car seat represents an additional scrotal and consequently testicular heat stress factor to that which is present by merely sitting for long periods
8964841 it ceases to remain personal once an official complaint has been lodged in writing to the forum
8964842 the artistes forum ought to have taken action as soon as the letter reached it it is an important issue that involves the entire industry
8964843 if koel has really made such comments and swastika has leashed out against them then koel is responsible for whatever has happened you must expect to be hit back if you throw a stone at someone if others in the industry followed swastikas example then the mass adulation of stars would get back its former position
8964844 the final decision the casting and crew for any film is jointly taken by the producer and the director considering the demands of the character within the script as hero all i can do is to suggest names if anyone feels that i have been suggesting swastikas name to every director may i kindly point out that i have recommended koels name too for bandhan i suggested the names of sagnik and sandhita for champion so the bottom line is that everything in casting is a mutual decision between the producer director on the one hand and the hero on the other i was stunned when i read koels comments i back swastika rachana and others who support their stand completely if someone lights a fire and thinks she can get away without being hit back by its flames she is mistaken
8964845 i cannot blame swastika we have families of our own we command some respect among the masses koels irresponsible comments that definitely point fingers at actresses and the casting couch can harm all of us the saddest part of this whole issue is that koel fails to realise that if you point a finger at others the other fingers will point back at you
8964846 here is a role id like to play and no one else should do it
8964847 we are launching the bengali marathi and gujarati channels on our own and all the three channels will come up before june end next year
8964848 the state has a unique cultural identity with a great body of art and literature and our programming will draw from this identifiable treasure trove of great culture and literature our channel will attempt to present a different style of storytelling the youthful look of the channel will further drive away the false notion that anything to do with the word regional translates into an inferior quality of content and presentation
8964849 we see an upper sec male skew in bengali gec viewership our bengali channel is positioned with this in mind
8964850 the relationship between star and balaji as broadcaster and content provider will not be affected
8964851 star and balaji have agreed to determine all prior agreements such that each side is freed from all respective rights and obligations arising from such agreements
8964852 star and btl have enjoyed a successful relationship over the past few years one that has been to the mutual benefit of both we are keen to continue this relationship in the best spirit going forward
8964853 for a long time ive wanted to make a period horror film set in the hill stations of the british raj
8964854 i go by instinct i think the time has come for us not to think that small films should be made with small stars and big films with big stars even films with big stars flop it is the story that works in the end
8964855 an item number is most needed in a horror film
8964856 till then the audiences brains are fried with fear constant horror is monotonous the song brings a bit of relief and is needed because the sequence immediately after will shock the daylights out of you
8964857 we were in a quandary we wanted the songs to sound like they belonged to the year 1920 yet appeal to the listeners of today
8964858 but we did not have any problems from the ghosts i think they were quite happy that someone is making a film on them you can even say the film is sponsored by spirits
8964859 just because modern physics doesnt say so doesnt mean they dont exist
8964860 my life can either be about one film or about my growth
8964861 i hope to finish it by january but i am very lazy
8964862 it has one of the finest depictions of friendship on screen every time i see it it is emotional and very touching i think it set the benchmark for depictions of friendship in hindi movies
8964863 in todays times the relationship might seem implausible because you have an inspector who is fighting criminals being friends with a lawyer who is helping those criminals escape the jail but i feel it was a unique relationship i still remember the friendship song
8964864 dch is in a league of its own it is not just about the friendship of these three heroes but also about how they use it as a guide for their other relationships
8964865 true friendship has to be selfless which is how it is in the film the film is beautiful because all three of them are good friends they understand each other as human beings even if they fight
8964866 we never wanted to make this into a reality show that people normally have preconceived notions about we had come together with a motive to bring out true talent that our children have
8964867 we had initially decided to shortlist 32 entries for the finals but looking at the talent and the overwhelming response we decided to increase the number to 50 it was this same talent that compelled us to divide them in two age groups
8964868 till that moment we never thought the show would be so popular but it was the talent pool that made us feel this would be a unique show
8964869 we did not want to give them the feel of a competition while many reality shows take away the originality of the contestants we decided not to suppress the child in them thus instead of calling the judges sir or maam here the children call them avdhoot dada and vaishali tai
8964870 avdhoot dada and vaishali tai cheer us up before and after the show what i also realised during the grooming sessions and the performance is that my competition is not with others but with myself
8964871 like most of the parents i was reluctant to send ketki for this contest but my experience here was completely different what i like about the show is that they treat children like performers yet keeping the child in them intact she would initially sing childrens songs but what she sings today are the songs that adults sing
8964872 platform and appreciation are no doubt the positive aspects of this show but there is another side to it as well not only children but also the parents get used to the attention that their children draw and once addicted to limelight it becomes difficult for them to live without it i believe that it is the responsibility of the parents to make their children realise that it is the performance that matters and not the glamour i keep advising the contestants that whether they win or lose the riyaz must begin from the very next day more than success what matters is the time when it comes
8964873 what i like about the show is the way the judges explain the intricacies of music the show is filled with talented children and getting knocked out might mean the end of the world for them but i must say the judges constantly pep them up to be better performers the next time
8964874 it is difficult to be judges but that is only for the moment when we give the scores after that we like the audience enjoy the show and feel it should never end
8964875 die jungs haben einen tollen zusammenhalt und das ist f r unsere art zu spielen sehr wichtig
8964876 wir werden auch heute offensiv spielen aber hoffentlich mit weniger fehlern
8964877 we have a high level of respect for georgia southern
8964878 most of their kids are from in state just as ours are we think it will be a pretty heated rivalry a great majority of our georgia guys have high school teammates on their team
8964879 i dont know how theyre going to react if we were playing in front of 92 000 or in front of 4 000
8964880 i just dont know i wish i did i sure would sleep better at night
8964881 is it a good thing its good if we stay there if were there at the end
8964882 i would have to think its a motivating factor for our guys and an excitement factor for our guys to feel like people believe that about our program but its going to be up for judgment every week from this week forward
8964883 has the highest likelihood of having a non genuine copy
8964884 look i dont know from where these stories surface it is true i know her and we are friends but no i am not having any affair with her
8964885 the media has always played up stories whenever cricketers or actors have been friends it is nothing new we are just good friends and we have gone out a couple of times in mumbai
8964886 the story is about a little boy and his best friend a donkey it is almost after 18 years that a bollywood film has been entirely shot in the valley and the experience was very overwhelming
8964887 the security personnel were friendly because we shot in winter a large crowd used to surround us all the time some women and children were very enthusiastic to work in the movie
8964888 our crew members thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful sceneries of j amp k at that time the valley was very peaceful and police and locals also supported us we have not imagined that when the film will be ready for release the condition would be so worse
8964889 anupam kher is a kashmiri but even he had some first time visit to some places he was very happy we also let locals to be the part of the film
8964890 no it is not based on any real incident but completely a fiction but it does have a few aspect of terrorism and the film has been given a u certificate
8964891 i have watched quite a few episodes and i think the character portrayals are interesting
8964892 during my research for sbas i met many housewives who collect the kitty party money and invest in the stock market
8964893 for many of us the sensex is just numbers that go up and down but it is a phenomenon that affects many
8964894 usually when we show india it is about poverty i wanted to show us in a positive outlook
8964895 i wanted to make it interesting for even those who know nothing about the sensex
8964896 saas bahu aur sensex falls more in the old school style with delicate characterisation like chashme buddoor its a non traditional comedy
8964897 when they were on the sets i felt like im the old person and they are the young ones they were so mischievous and naughty
8964898 if we have even a bit of sense of humour it can get us through lifes difficult moments
8964899 were giving youngsters an open platform to do an ad with akshay the ads announcing the contest will be aired on tv starting august 27 we will also promote it through the outdoor and internet medium and through our 200 stores across the country
8964900 if it works roadside romeo would change the scenario for all of us
8964901 getting film folks and trade to attend the conference has been an exhilarating experience this has been a modest beginning but the event has given us an assured positive outcome that there will be a movement towards bringing animation into the mainstream
8964902 indian cinemas fancy with animation has been increasing by the day this thrill of telling a story in an altogether new way has excited not only the new breed but also the legends in the field in this quest directors distributors financers exhibitors and the animation fraternity were collectively looking forward to share knowledge and insights to complete the frame and after the resounding success of this event i am sure many more such events will follow
8964903 it is a myth that classical music lacks an audience in the country
8964904 classical music is a high end product and it is important to create a buzz around it through proper marketing
8964905 the mobile phone is the future of music due to an increasing mobile market physical music sales have gone down drastically youth are discovering and accessing music through free internet sites there is a shift from music ownership to music consumption classical musicians too should recognise the potential of this platform
8964906 classical music is a super niche category the market for classical music downloads in india is almost negligible while bollywood has a market share of 60 to 65 per cent of the entire music industry regional music is making its presence felt with a share of around 30 per cent the share for classical music is as low as 1 per cent
8964907 there can be a sizeable audience for classical music only if it is incorporated in bollywood films
8964908 money has become a major player in determining the success of classical music more corporate support accompanied with efficient organising skills can breathe life into this medium
8964909 connecting with the youth is an important aspect in popularising classical music
8964910 the new generation of classical musicians is opting for fusion music and releasing their music videos which helps attract a wider audience
8964911 until a few years ago there was hardly a glamour quotient in the way a hindustani musical show was presented on television
8964912 but the younger breed of classical musicians has realised the need to package themselves and present themselves as a strong brand
8964913 the idea is to make the whole experience a blend of education and entertainment it isnt just effective but is extremely interactive amongst the movie lovers
8964914 although one needs to watch the movie with 3 d glasses one can have a multi sensory experience which is not involved in a 3 d or 4 d film the seats supplied by simnora have special effects for water jet passage tickling effect air nozzles and a fragrance nozzle the evolution of our country can be seen in a varied manner
8964915 the entire production unit at israel is extremely professional the concept that has been a huge success in israel for 11 years will definitely lure movie lovers in india
8964916 not yet but we have plans of introducing the format at popular tourist destinations such as jaipur and goa indian culture and entertainment are very popular the world over and we plan to launch it at international airport terminals
8964917 my desire to live with you remains unfulfilled may i get to live with you again in another life
8964918 i have always felt that a politician is to be judged by the animosities he excites among his opponents
8964919 dir ne n mirovski aborde un sujet pr dominant dans la france des ann es 1930 celui de limmigration deurope centrale et orientale paria sur le continent europ en et bient t dans le monde entier

8964921 eles os produtores queriam outra mulher no j ri no caso de paula perder uma filmagem
8964922 houve diversas vezes que tiveram que dar cobertura paula durante as apresenta es ao vivo ela estava completamente desaparecida
8964923 na verdade paula ama o que ela faz ela jamais iria desaparecer por completo ela voltaria mas talvez n o a tempo da filmagem ao vivo
8964924 and thus a nation of loud and proud rednecks was born
8964925 der gro handel h lt weiter kurs auf ein erfolgreiches jahr das auseinanderklaffen zwischen nominaler und realer umsatzentwicklung im gro handel h lt an und zeigt den preisdruck am markt die klimaindikatoren und die auftragseing nge haben sich jedoch deutlich verschlechtert und zeigen dass sich deutschland der abk hlenden weltwirtschaft nicht entziehen kann die politik ist deshalb gut beraten an reformtempo zuzulegen
8964926 die positiven entwicklungen von f nf der sechs teilbereiche im gro handel weisen auf die breite der umsatzentwicklung hin und best tigen zugleich die entwicklung in den letzten monaten der preisdruck in den m rkten bleibt besonders im gro handel bestehen und senkt wie das auseinanderklaffen der realen und nominalen ums tze zeigt die margen der gro h ndler der gro handel wird seiner aufgabe als preispuffer weiterhin gerecht
8964927 once developed this molecule will cause much less wheezing and shortness of breath and should be able to be given safely to the hundreds of thousands of patients with both heart and lung diseases furthermore because it will have so few side effects it has the potential to become the beta blocker of choice for all heart patients
8964928 we know that beta blockers save lives in patients with heart disease so making them safe for those unlucky enough to have a respiratory disorder as well is a clinical imperative i applaud jill baker for questioning why beta blockers should remain contraindicated for so many of her patients and being stirred to correct this with an incisive programme of work in the best traditions of medical research this endeavour was born out of a problem encountered at the sharp end of clinical practice
8964929 by building upon the experience acquired over the past years we are now ready to put into production the first e infrastructure that will enable sharing and seamless access to heterogeneous content service and computer resources
8964930 we expect that the d4science infrastructure will have a multiplicative benefit to many scientific fields in a not distant future it will be able to act as a catalyst for increasing the resource sharing cooperation and cross fertilisation among multiple communities that is necessary for addressing the many grand challenges of science and society
8964931 these microdomains are so tiny you could fit five million on them on a full stop there are 10 000 receptors on each cell and we are able to follow how single drug molecules bind to individual receptors in these specialised microdomains
8964932 what makes this single molecule laser technique unique is that we are looking at them in real time on a living cell other techniques that investigate how drugs bind to their receptors require many millions of cells to get a big enough signal and this normally involves destroying the cells in the process
8964933 since the nineteen seventies vigorous technical debates have been in progress regarding the function of plasma which however have not led to any conclusive results in particular we do not fully understand the exact energy coupling mechanism
8964934 ever since plasma has been discovered and utilized significant differences have existed between theoretical predictions on the behavior of the plasma and actual measurements
8964935 electron resonance can even be controlled specifically to initiate the mechanism
8964936 this isnt just about cutting down on the number of squirrels killed on the roads we also know that when a natural habitat becomes fragmented such as by the introduction of unnatural barriers like roads there is a lesser chance of the species surviving in the long term because the opportunities for breeding are fewer the bridges hopefully encourage the squirrels to explore a wider area and therefore lessen the chance of inbreeding by finding out whether they actually use these bridges we can assess how useful it is to install them
8964937 an snh grant for rope bridges was successfully applied for by the local community of strachur and two have been erected across the main road there but we needed to find out how cost effective they were before spending any more money putting them up at other sites when we looked into it we were surprised to discover that no one has ever really tested the efficiency of these bridges the research that stephen from the university of leeds has now carried out should help us make our case when we apply for funding for future projects
8964938 in areas where there is a high population of squirrels then the new bridges we put up were being used within a couple of days not surprisingly we also found that baiting the bridges with food also encouraged the squirrels to use them this kind of information has never been collected before and it could now be used by other wildlife conservation groups or even by developers when considering plans for new road building projects that cut through squirrel habitat
8964939 our masters programme in biodiversity and conservation provides us with an opportunity to conduct the kind of research that could have a real impact on british wildlife this project is just one example
8964940 our ice breaking research vessel polarstern is currently on a scientific mission in the arctic ocean departing from iceland the route has taken the ship through the northwest passage into the canadian basin where geophysical and geological studies will be carried out along profiles into the makarov basin to study the tectonic history and submarine geology of the central arctic ocean in addition oceanographic as well as biological studies will be carried out polarstern will circumnavigate the whole arctic ocean and exit through the northeast passage
8964941 the polar regions especially the arctic are very sensitive indicators of climate change the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change has shown that these regions are highly vulnerable to rising temperatures and predicted that the arctic would be virtually ice free in the summer months by 2070 other scientists claim it could become ice free as early as 2040 latest satellite observations suggest that the arctic could be mainly ice free even earlier
8964942 at awi we place particular emphasis on studying arctic sea ice and along with in situ studies of sea ice thickness change satellite data have been used extensively not only for the regular observation of changes in the arctic and antarctic but also for optimising the operation of polarstern in regions covered by sea ice
8964943 fear of legal problems is one of the main reasons why smes are slow to launch internet based services from e commerce to online marketing
8964944 it is vital for smes to know what regulations apply to which country to respect them and then to adjust their cash flow to reflect their obligations
8964945 web 2 0 refers to the sharing collaboration and interactivity typical in many of the most successful online services that have launched in recent years
8964946 we didnt use the wikipedia software which is also open source because any users can post information
8964947 we check contributors manually using our panel of experts around europe to establish that the contributor has a sufficient level of expertise to write an article on internet law
8964948 most of the contributors come from universities or law firms who want to raise their profile
8964949 the choice of contributors was deliberate because were hoping to keep the service as low cost as possible so it will remain sustainable
8964950 we are building a critical mass of users and contributors around the world and we hope the service will continue to track the rapid change in online law
8964951 i am a lifetime member of the nra i support our constitutional right to bear arms and am a proponent of gun safety programs for alaskas youth i have always strongly supported the personal use of fish and game by alaskans i grew up hunting and fishing in alaska and i am proud to raise my children with this same uniquely alaskan heritage anti hunting groups who oppose hunting and fishing rights will be the winners if we allow them to pit us against ourselves as an alaskan with strong beliefs on this issue i am confident in my ability to build consensus among diverse user groups and reconcile the many competing interests in a manner

8964956 we are going to move forward we are in the process of talking to the government they have not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us
8964957 given all of these considerations we believe that it is imperative as nasa continues the transition from the space shuttle to the successor vehicles that the means for producing additional flight hardware and obtaining additional flight engineering and support services not be completely or irretrievably lost through destruction or deterioration at least until a clear path to alternative launch capabilities is at hand at a minimum we request that you direct nasa to take no action for at least one year from now that would preclude the extended use of the space shuttle beyond 2010 we understand that several such actions are pending in the near future and believe that allowing them to continue would remove an option for us human spaceflight capability that must not be irretrievably lost at this time
8964958 in probably 15 to 18 months would would have the parts to build that second tank only a year or so later than we needed them
8964959 hey i am the biggest shuttle hugger there is i think it is the best spacecraft ever built but i also deal in the real world where does the money come from where do the people who should be working on the moon rocket where do they come from we started shutting down the shuttle four years ago that horse has left the barn
8964960 its not the size of the wand its the magic in it

8964962 there is a reserve day for this match and if there cannot be any more play today the match will be continued from 14 2 overs tomorrow
8964963 with these fellows out of the way the loyalty of my 1948 side was a big joy and made a big contribution to the outstanding success of that tour
8964964 there is a reserve day for this match and if there cannot be any more play today the match will be continued from 14 2 overs tomorrow
8964965 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me
8964966 i will not plead in line with my standpoint as regards to this court
8964967 may i hold you to your word that i am not guilty
8964968 we came to see the initial appearance of the biggest butcher of the 20th century in the balkans
8964969 contributive efforts are better because you are not relying on one individual
8964970 you will get individual performances brilliantly but its always better to win through a team effort everyone can enjoy it that way
8964971 he has played two crucial knocks and he is outstanding
8964972 at this level youngsters do not get many opportunities i am happy that they have grabbed the opportunities that came their way
8964973 i read the hands of murali and mendis my game plan was that if i could read their bowling i could play them well
8964974 our batting has let us down disappointed the way we played we had opportunities but we have not utilised but one day cricket cannot be predicted and is about opportunities overall performance with the bat has been inconsistent
8964975 adopted for life the priority of adoption for christian families and churches
8964976 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8964977 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8964978 i guess by tomorrow they will have their act a little more in order
8964979 put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
8964980 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
8964981 it shows perhaps that hes a bit of a gambler that he was willing at this stage to roll the dice
8964982 its a tremendous risk to take someone of this little experience
8964983 shows that theyre making a concerted effort to go after women voters who are upset that barack obama passed over hillary clinton
8964984 a quintessential john mccain pick shes someone whos a reformer someone whos been a maverick
8964985 we dont want to be too presumptive we need to carry out the scientific work the forensic work to make sure weve done it
8964986 the remains we believe will be released to our government for repatriation to australia and as i say well be able to finally give private fishers family the opportunity to say an appropriate good bye to a fallen hero
8964987 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8964988 all of us at showtime wish david and his family the best during this very private time
8964989 you know john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8964990 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
8964991 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8964992 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency ofthe united states
8964993 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8964994 in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own out of work tough luck no healthcare the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own
8964995 well its time for them to own their failure its time for us to change america
8964996 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
8964997 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8964998 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet
8964999 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and thefailed policies of george w bush
8965000 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8965001 i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8965002 must also admit that fulfilling americas promise will require more than just money
8965003 it will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what john f kennedy called our intellectual and moral strength
8965004 yes we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair but we must also admit that programs alone cant replace parents that governments cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need
8965005 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8965006 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meagre record of barack obama
8965007 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8965008 john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have for while he was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing it would distract us from the real threats we face
8965009 i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8965010 the carbon price will be higher non assisted industries and firms will have to reduce their emissions even further and the impact on household budgets will be even greater

8965012 it has left the whole family in darkness this episode just because of some i dont know some foolish mistakes from some person
8965013 the afp has concluded its active inquiries although some longstanding overseas inquiries are yet to be fully resolved
8965014 at the present time there is insufficient evidence to institute proceedings against dr haneef for any criminal offence
8965015 the continued claims by mr keelty that dr haneef was a person of interest which is the police euphemism for a suspect has continued and exacerbated the damage to dr haneefs reputation that the unreasonable and unjustified actions of july 2 2007 had already caused
8965016 we are ready to negotiate the terms of any apology and a damages settlement with the government so as to avoid the unnecessary expense and further angst of civil litigation
8965017 i have always had a plan to come back to australia and i still believe i have this option open
8965018 its just a matter of convincing my family it is very hard its my wife and my mother and my mother in law
8965019 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me
8965020 i will not plead in line with my standpoint as regards to this court
8965021 may i hold you to your word that i am not guilty
8965022 we came to see the initial appearance of the biggest butcher of the 20th century in the balkans
8965023 there is little appreciation of what gm is and how it can improve food production
8965024 gm is extremely important unfortunately there is little appreciation of what it is and how it can improve food production there is a need for advocacy
8965025 is it possible to solve the food security problem in africa without gm
8965026 but its the right of every country to decide if it wants to use gm
8965027 in the short term we should look to conventional approaches
8965028 i dont think african food security depends on gm crops
8965029 la compa a indic al aeropuerto la posibilidad de sustituir la aeronave aunque finalmente tambi n comunic al centro de gesti n aeroportuario que decid a continuar con la aeronave que hab a pedido sustituir

8965034 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like a no 1 probably not
8965035 its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8965036 i was thinking am i really made to play tennis
8965037 i think what i experienced so far is girls when they play against higher ranked players they have nothing to lose so they go for their shots
8965038 many times they play matches of their life not only in womens tennis also in mens
8965039 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8965040 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08
8965041 la mesure du taux de b ta amylo de dans le cerveau pourrait devenir un bon indicateur du retour de la communication des cellules entre elles
8965042 what i hope happens is the country doesnt forget the jubilation and excitement thats been generated here
8965043 and i hope it turns into something that changes the world
8965044 i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
8965045 really spoke to me as a woman and i think she spoke to a lot of people in that way
8965046 sales have been under pressure for so long even before the retail environment became challenging
8965047 one of the concerns is that the company continues to lose market share and in that case theres only so much it can do in terms of cost cutting and realigning the organization
8965048 da han s stemadministratoren red har samlet den nye server og installeret systemer p den g r en anden kritisk del af mailsystemet ned et problem der skal tilses med det samme for at sikre fortsat modtagelse af post p vores system da telefonsupporterne tager hjem tirsdag eftermiddag tror de faktisk at systemet bliver reetableret meget snart
8965049 vores kommunikation imellem teknikere og support svigter desv rre i den periode og vi f r derfor ikke informeret vores kunder om de nyopst ede problemer i l bet af tirsdag aften og derfor st r vores driftmeddelelse forkert tirsdag eftermiddag og aften det er vi meget kede af og det er naturligvis noget af det vi m evaluere p s vores kommunikation kan forbedres fremover
8965050 et nyopst ede problem der deler sig i to for rsager at vi bliver yderligere forsinket vi har faktisk f rst den nye mailserver oppe onsdag morgen da den kommer op bliver den ganske jeblikkeligt overbelastet af ivrige kunder og derfor g r det meget langsomt for den med at komme i gang med leveringen af mail p normal vis f rst hen imod slutningen af eftermiddagen vil de fleste kunder have oplevet normal maildrift den prioriterer i denne periode meget de nye mails for at kunne f dem igennem og derfor st r mange af de gamle mails fra s ndag stadig i k p skrivende tidspunkt de vil blive leveret i den hastighed serverens arbejdsbyrde tillader nogle af disse mails ligger p diske fra det nedbrudte system hvor de skal genoprettes fra hvilket vi lige nu er i gang med
8965051 i disse tilf lde vil afsender have modtaget en fejlmail retur men normale mailsystemer vil vedblive at fors ge at levere mails til os i 4 dage dermed burde ogs disse mails p et tidspunkt komme igennem da disse folks dns kom op igen onsdag morgen
8965052 it feels good man you know to get a second chance and i just have to take advantage of it
8965053 first and foremost i dont want to let myself down definitely my little girl down im thankful for cowboys owner jerry jones the fans in dallas and my teammates for believing in me i need to keep doing what ive been doing to get reinstated staying with myself and my teammates and staying away from those knuckleheads and just stay focused
8965054 i am very grateful for this opportunity and i understand my responsibilities to the dallas cowboys and the national football league right now i just want to keep working hard so i can accomplish the goals that i have set for myself both on and off the field
8965055 i dont have it lingering over my head will he get reinstated will he not get reinstated i just have to keep myself out of bad situations like i have been doing the last six or seven months
8965056 i did scream immediately i called my mom because ive been beating myself up but my mom has been through this roller coaster with me
8965057 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8965058 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8965059 i have to conduct myself like an nfl player to make sure none of these actions come again
8965060 i work hard every day to make sure i dont make the same mistakes can i say i would never ever make the same mistakes no i cant say that ill make sure i put myself in way better situations than i have put myself in the past
8965061 surrounding myself around the right people and staying out of gentlemens clubs having a great relationship with god and spending more time with my family
8965062 i think from the beginning there were a lot of critics saying that this couldnt be done that he couldnt turn his life around
8965063 hes proven everyone wrong hes got a very bright personal and professional future
8965064 theres no sure thing in life its nice to finally get the affirmation for all the hard work hes put in
8965065 the rest is up to him its time to play football hes a very motivated player i think hes matured greatly through this he has a good head on his shoulders he should be fine
8965066 being human it changed him a lot it was a very difficult process to go through
8965067 durante a tarde eles v o se dedicar campanha mas far o isso de forma volunt ria
8965068 ap s o expediente todos devem se dedicar minha campanha
8965069 s o 14 funcion rios mas s estar o trabalhando pelas elei es fora do expediente
8965070 n o tenho ger ncia sobre os gabinetes cada um faz o que quer pelo menos os setores administrativos v o funcionar normalmente
8965071 ao presidente dean e ao meu grande amigo dick durbin e a todos os meus concidad os deste grande pa s com profunda gratid o e grande humildade aceito sua indica o para disputar a presid ncia dos estados unidos
8965072 permitam me exprimir meus agradecimentos ao conjunto hist rico de pr candidatos que me acompanharam nessa jornada e especialmente quela que percorreu a maior dist ncia uma defensora dos trabalhadores norte americanos e uma inspira o para as minhas filhas e para as suas filhas hillary clinton
8965073 ao presidente clinton ao presidente bill clinton que na noite de ontem defendeu a necessidade de mudan a da maneira que s ele capaz a ted kennedy que personifica o esp rito do servi o p blico e ao pr ximo vice presidente dos estados unidos joe biden muito obrigado
8965074 estou grato por concluir esta jornada com um dos melhores estadistas de nossa era um homem que se sente bem na companhia de todos de l deres mundiais aos condutores do trem amtrak que ele ainda toma para voltar para casa a cada noite
8965075 ao amor da minha vida michelle obama e a malia e sasha a quem amo muito e de quem muito me orgulho
8965076 quatro anos atr s eu lhes contei minha hist ria sobre a breve uni o entre um jovem do qu nia e uma jovem do kansas que n o eram bem conhecidos nem estavam bem de vida mas compartilhavam a cren a em que nos estados unidos seu filho seria capaz de realizar tudo aquilo que desejasse
8965077 essa promessa que sempre distinguiu o nosso pa s a de que pelo trabalho rduo e pelo sacrif cio cada um de n s possa seguir seus sonhos pessoais e ainda assim se manter unido grande fam lia norte americana para garantir que a gera o seguinte seja capaz de igualmente seguir os seus sonhos por isso que estou aqui hoje porque por 232 anos sempre que essa promessa esteve sob amea a homens e mulheres comuns estudantes e soldados agricultores e professores enfermeiros e zeladores encontraram a coragem necess ria a mant la viva
8965078 n s estamos reunidos em um desses momentos de defini o um momento em que o nosso pa s est em guerra nossa economia passa por tumultos e a promessa norte americana mais uma vez est amea ada
8965079 hoje mais norte americanos est o desempregados e ainda mais deles v m trabalhando muito por sal rios cada vez menores
8965080 am rica n s somos melhores do que os oito anos passados demonstram somos um pa s melhor que isso
8965081 este pa s mais decente do que aquele no qual uma mulher do ohio beira da aposentadoria se v a uma doen a de dist ncia do desastre econ mico depois de uma vida de trabalho rduo
8965082 somos um pa s melhor do que aquele no qual um homem de indiana tem de embalar o equipamento com o qual trabalhou por 20 anos e assisti lo sendo despachado china e depois explicar com a voz embargada sua sensa o de fracasso ao voltar para casa e informar sua fam lia sobre a not cia
8965083 somos mais compassivos do que um governo que permite que veteranos de guerra durmam nas ruas e fam lias ca am pobreza que se mant m im vel enquanto uma grande cidade norte americana se afoga diante de seus olhos
8965084 este momento esta elei o nossa chance de manter a promessa dos estados unidos viva no s culo xix
8965085 porque na semana que vem em minnesota o mesmo partido que lhes deu dois mandatos de george bush e dick cheney pedir por um terceiro
8965086 em 4 de novembro devemos nos erguer e dizer que
8965087 e na semana que vem tamb m ouviremos falar sobre aquelas ocasi es em que ele se afastou de seu partido como prova de que poder nos propiciar a mudan a de que precisamos
8965088 mas o hist rico claro o senador john mccain votou com george bush 90 do tempo
8965089 o senador mccain gosta de falar de capacidade de julgamento mas o que podemos presumir sobre o julgamento de uma pessoa que acredita que george bush estivesse certo 90 do tempo
8965090 n o sei o que voc s acham mas n o estou preparado para aceitar uma chance de mudan a de apenas 10
8965091 a verdade que em quest o ap s quest o que poderiam fazer diferen a em nossas vidas sa de educa o e a economia o senador mccain n o se provou nada independente
8965092 ele disse que nossa economia fez grandes avan os sob o atual presidente
8965093 que ele o diga s fam lias de militares que arcam com seu fardo silenciosamente enquanto assistem partida de seus seres amados para uma terceira quarta ou quinta temporada de servi o em zonas de guerra
8965094 o ponto n o que eu acredite que o senador mccain n o se importa com o que est acontecendo nas vidas dos cidad os do pa s acredito que ele n o saiba
8965095 de que outra maneira ele poderia oferecer um plano de sa de que na pr tica tributaria os benef cios que as pessoas recebem ou um plano de educa o que nada faria por ajudar as fam lias a pagar pelos custos do ensino universit rio ou um plano que privatizaria o seguro social e colocaria em risco as aposentadorias de todos voc s
8965096 n o que john mccain n o se importa na verdade ele n o entende
8965097 voc s sabem n s democratas temos uma medida diferente quanto quilo que constitui progresso para o nosso pa s
8965098 medimos o progresso em termos do n mero de pessoas que conseguem encontrar empregos que lhes permitam manter em dia suas hipotecas e economizar um dinheirinho no final de cada m s para que um dia possam ver seus filhos recebendo um diploma universit rio
8965099 medimos o progresso com base nos 23 milh es de novos empregos criados quando bill clinton foi presidente anos em que as fam lias norte americanas viram alta de us 7 5 mil ao ano em sua renda m dia em lugar da queda de us 2 mil vista sob george bush
8965100 os fundamentos que empregamos para medir a for a da economia envolvem descobrir se estamos cumprindo a promessa fundamental que tornou este pa s grande a promessa que representa a nica raz o para que eu esteja aqui na noite de noite
8965101 porque nos rostos dos jovens veteranos que retornam do iraque e do afeganist o eu vejo meu av que se alistou depois de pearl harbor marchou com o ex rcito de patton e foi recompensado por um pa s agradecido com a oportunidade de fazer uma faculdade sob a gi bill lei que estimulava a retomada dos estudos pelos ex combatentes da segunda guerra mundial
8965102 no rosto daquela jovem estudante que dorme apenas tr s horas antes de come ar a trabalhar em seu emprego noturno vejo o de minha m e que criou minha irm e eu sem ajuda enquanto trabalhava e conclu a seus estudos e que precisou recorrer a assist ncia alimentar do governo em determinados momentos mas ainda assim conseguiu nos matricular nas melhores escolas do pa s com a ajuda de programas de cr dito educacional e bolsas de estudo
8965103 e quando ou o uma mulher falar sobre as dificuldades que encontra para abrir um neg cio ou subir na vida penso em minha av que avan ou de uma posi o como secret ria a um cargo executivo m dio a despeito de ter sido preterida nas promo es durante anos s porque era mulher
8965104 eu n o sei que esp cie de vida john mccain acredita que as celebridades levem mas sei que esta foi a minha
8965105 mas o que exatamente vem a ser a promessa dos estados unidos
8965106 uma promessa que diz que o mercado deve recompensar o esfor o e a inova o que geram crescimento mas que as empresas precisam cumprir sua responsabilidade de criar empregos aqui no pa s cuidar dos trabalhadores norte americanos e respeitar as regras do jogo
8965107 nossa promessa afirma que o governo n o capaz de resolver todos os problemas da na o mas que necess rio que fa a por n s aquilo que n s mesmos n o podemos que nos proteja do mal e que ofere a a cada crian a uma educa o decente que mantenha nossa gua limpa e nossos brinquedos seguros que invista em novas escolas e novas estradas e na ci ncia e tecnologia
8965108 nosso governo deveria trabalhar por n s e n o contra n s
8965109 essa a promessa da am rica a id ia de que somos respons veis por n s mesmos mas tamb m a de que ascenderemos ou cairemos como na o una a cren a fundamental de que cabe a mim ajudar os meus irm os e irm s
8965110 assim permitam me definir exatamente o que a palavra mudan a significaria caso eu me eleja presidente
8965111 ao contr rio de john mccain voc s sabem eu deixaria de conceder isen es fiscais a empresas que despacham empregos para o exterior e come aria a oferec las a empresas que criem empregos aqui nos estados unidos
8965112 eliminaria os impostos sobre os ganhos de capital das pequenas empresas e das companhias iniciantes que criar o os empregos de alto sal rio e de alta tecnologia do amanh
8965113 e pelo bem de nossa economia de nossa seguran a e pelo futuro de nosso planeta eu estabeleceria como presidente uma meta clara dentro de 10 anos por fim deixaremos de depender do petr leo do oriente m dio
8965114 e durante todo esse tempo ele disse n o a padr es mais severos de efici ncia energ tica para os autom veis n o aos investimentos em energia renov vel n o aos combust veis renov veis
8965115 como presidente explorarei nossas reservas de g s natural investirei na tecnologia do carv o limpo e encontrarei maneiras de empregar em seguran a a energia nuclear
8965116 depois de a tempestade sair da jamaica poss vel que ganhe bastante for a
8965117 am rica n o vivemos um momento de pensar pequeno chegou a hora de por fim cumprir nossa obriga o moral de oferecer a cada crian a uma educa o de primeira classe porque isso o m nimo necess rio a concorrer na economia mundial
8965118 como voc s sabem michelle e eu s estamos aqui hoje porque tivemos uma chance de obter educa o
8965119 investirei na educa o desde o in cio da inf ncia e recrutarei um ex rcito de novos professores a quem pagarei sal rios melhores e oferecerei mais apoio
8965120 e cumpriremos a nossa promessa a todos os jovens norte americanos se voc s assumirem o compromisso de servir as suas comunidades ou ao pa s garantiremos que tenham condi es de arcar com os custos de uma educa o superior
8965121 agora chegou enfim a hora de cumprir a promessa de um sistema de sa de acess vel e de pre o justo para cada cidad o dos estados unidos
8965122 se voc s j dispuserem de planos de sa de o plano que estou propondo ajudar a reduzir suas mensalidades
8965123 e na condi o de homem que assistiu pr pria m e brigando com operadoras de planos de sa de enquanto ela estava internada morrendo de c ncer garantirei plenamente que essas empresas deixem de praticar discrimina o contra as pessoas doentes exatamente as mais necessitadas de tratamentos de sa de
8965124 chegou a hora de ajudar as fam lias oferecendo licen as m dicas remuneradas e um sistema melhor de f rias familiares porque n o certo que qualquer cidad o norte americano se veja for ado a escolher entre manter o emprego ou tomar conta de um filho ou pai adoecido
8965125 agora chegou a hora de mudar nossas leis de fal ncia e concordata de modo que as pens es dos trabalhadores sejam protegidas acima de tudo e n o as bonifica es dos executivos e a hora de proteger o sistema de seguro social em benef cio das futuras gera es
8965126 e agora chegou a hora de cumprir a promessa de igualdade salarial por trabalho igual porque desejo que minhas filhas tenham exatamente as mesmas oportunidades que os filhos de voc s
8965127 sabemos claro que muitos desses planos custar o dinheiro e por isso que expliquei claramente como cada centavo de custo ser coberto eliminando as lacunas tribut rias que beneficiam empresas e os para sos fiscais que n o ajudam no crescimento dos estados unidos
8965128 mas tamb m pretendo estudar o or amento federal linha a linha eliminando todos os programas que deixaram de funcionar e fazendo aqueles de que precisamos funcionar melhor e a um custo menor porque n o podemos enfrentar os desafios do s culo 21 com uma burocracia do s culo xx
8965129 e meus amigos democratas preciso que admitamos que cumprir a promessa dos estados unidos requerer mais do que simplesmente dinheiro
8965130 sim o governo precisa liderar no esfor o para promover a independ ncia energ tica mas cada um de n s precisa batalhar para tornar nossas casas e nossas empresas mais eficientes
8965131 sim devemos fornecer novos caminhos e mais caminhos para que os jovens que se deixam levar a uma vida de crime e desespero possam encontrar o sucesso
8965132 responsabilidade individual e responsabilidade m tua essa a ess ncia da promessa norte americana e da mesma maneira que cumpriremos essa promessa para a pr xima gera o em nosso pa s devemos cumprir igualmente a promessa dos estados unidos ao resto do mundo
8965133 caso john mccain deseje realizar um debate sobre quem tem o temperamento e o senso de julgamento mais adequado para o papel de nosso pr ximo comandante em chefe eis um debate do qual eu adoraria participar
8965134 porque enquanto o senador mccain estava concentrando suas aten es no iraque j alguns dias depois dos ataques de 11 de setembro de 2001 eu preferi me erguer em oposi o guerra sabendo que ela nos distrairia quanto s amea as reais que o pa s enfrenta
8965135 quando john mccain disse que pod amos simplesmente continuar tocando a situa o no afeganist o sem muitas mudan as eu defendi o envio de mais recursos e de mais soldados ao pa s para concluir a luta contra os terroristas que realmente nos atacaram em 11 de setembro e deixei claro que se tivermos osama bin laden e seus lugares tenentes em nossa mira devemos abat los sem hesita o
8965136 john mccain voc s sabem gosta de dizer que ele seguiria bin laden at os port es do inferno se necess rio mas na verdade n o o segue nem mesmo at a caverna onde bin laden vive
8965137 e hoje sim hoje depois que meus apelos por um cronograma para a retirada de nossas tropas do iraque foi ecoado pelo governo iraquiano e at mesmo pela administra o bush mesmo depois de termos descoberto que o governo iraquiano registra um super vit de us 79 bilh es enquanto estamos afogados em d ficits john mccain continua isolado em sua teimosa recusa quanto a p r fim a uma guerra que jamais deveria ter sido travada
8965138 n o desse tipo de ju zo que precisamos isso n o manter os estados unidos seguros
8965139 n o se derrota n o se pode derrotar uma rede terrorista que opera em 80 pa ses por meio da ocupa o do iraque
8965140 caso john mccain deseje seguir nos passos de george bush que sempre fala duro e sempre opta por m s estrat gias isso seu problema mas n o essa a mudan a de que os estados unidos precisam
8965141 somos o partido de roosevelt somos o partido de kennedy por isso n o venham me dizer que os democratas n o defender o o pa s n o venham me dizer que os democratas n o ser o capazes de nos manter em seguran a a pol tica externa de bush e mccain desperdi ou esse legado que gera es de norte americanos democratas e republicanos batalharam por construir e estamos aqui para restaur lo
8965142 como comandante em chefe jamais hesitarei em defender o pa s mas s enviarei nossas tropas em opera es militares com uma miss o clara e tendo assumido o sagrado compromisso de lhes dar o equipamento de que elas precisar o em combate e os cuidados e benef cios de que necessitar o quando voltarem para casa
8965143 encerrarei a guerra no iraque de maneira respons vel e concluirei os combates contra a al qaeda e o talib no afeganist o
8965144 construirei novas parcerias para derrotar as amea as do s culo xix terrorismo e prolifera o nuclear pobreza e genoc dio altera es clim ticas e doen as
8965145 e restaurarei nossa posi o moral de modo que os estados unidos estejam uma vez mais possam ser a ltima e a melhor das esperan as daqueles que se sentem compelidos a tomar a causa da liberdade no anseio de uma vida de paz e daqueles que desejam um futuro melhor
8965146 s o estas as pol ticas que pretendo adotar e nas pr ximas semanas aguardo ansiosamente pela oportunidade de debat las com john mccain mas o que n o farei sugerir que o senador assume as posi es que assume por motivos pol ticos porque uma das coisas que precisamos mudar em nossa pol tica a id ia de que pessoas n o podem discordar em que isso resulte em contesta es ao car ter e ao patriotismo uns dos outros
8965147 o momento s rio demais e h coisas demais em jogo para que essa mesma t tica das disputas partid rias do passado seja repetida
8965148 os homens e mulheres que servem em nossas campos de batalha podem ser democratas republicanos ou independentes mas eles combateram juntos e sangraram juntos muitos deles at mesmo morreram juntos em defesa da mesma orgulhosa bandeira
8965149 por isso tenho uma novidade para voc john mccain colocaremos o pa s em primeiro lugar
8965150 podemos n o concordar quanto ao aborto mas decerto podemos concordar quanto redu o do n mero de gesta es indesejadas em nosso pa s
8965151 a realidade da posse de armas pode ser diferente para os adeptos da ca a na zona rural do ohio e para as pessoas que est o sob o ass dio da viol ncia das gangues em cleveland mas n o venham me dizer que imposs vel defender a segunda emenda constitui o americana que garante o direito ao porte de armas sem que para isso tenhamos de permitir a criminosos o acesso a fuzis de assalto ak 47
8965152 sei que existem diferen as quanto ao casamento homossexual mas certamente todos podemos concordar em que nossos irm os homossexuais t m o direito de visitar a pessoa que amam em um hospital e a viver suas vidas livres de discrimina o
8965153 a discuss o quanto imigra o pode se tornar passional voc s sabem mas n o conhe o ningu m que seja beneficiado pelo fato de que uma m e se veja separada de seu filho pequeno ou por um empregador norte americano que tente escapar s normas salariais do pa s contratando imigrantes ilegais
8965154 mas isso tudo tamb m parte da promessa dos estados unidos da promessa de uma democracia na qual podemos encontrar a for a e a gra a necess rias a superar as divis es que nos afastam e encontrar a uni o em nome de um esfor o comum
8965155 sei que existem muitas pessoas que descartam esse tipo de afirma o sob a rubrica de otimismo ing nuo alegam que a nossa insist ncia em algo de maior algo de mais firme e mais honesto em nossa vida p blica representa apenas um cavalo de tr ia para impostos mais altos e para o abandono de nossos valores tradicionais
8965156 de esperar que o fa am porque quando n o existem id ias novas s resta recorrer embolorada t tica de assustar os eleitores
8965157 caso voc n o tenha um hist rico positivo para apresentar em sua campanha ent o basta pintar o seu oponente como algu m de quem as pessoas deveriam fugir correndo
8965158 e se voc s querem saber essa t tica funcionou no passado porque se enquadra bem ao cinismo que todos sentimos com rela o ao governo
8965159 mas estou ocupando esta posi o diante de voc s na noite de hoje porque algo est despertando nos estados unidos o que as pessoas de vis o negativa n o compreendem que esta elei o jamais girou em torno de mim gira em torno de voc s
8965160 por longos 18 meses voc s se ergueram um a um e disseram
8965161 demonstramos o que a hist ria nos ensina que em momentos de defini o como o atual a mudan a n o vem de washington
8965162 mudan as acontecem acontecem porque o povo dos estados unidos exige se ergue e insiste em novas id ias e novas lideran as uma nova pol tica para uma nova era
8965163 acredito que por mais dif cil que venha a ser a mudan a de que precisamos est a caminho porque n s a vimos e a vivemos
8965164 eu a vi em washington onde superamos divis es partid rias para abrir o governo e tornar os profissionais de lobby mais diretamente respons veis pelos seus atos para oferecer melhor assist ncia aos nossos veteranos de guerra e impedir que terroristas viessem a ter acesso a armas nucleares
8965165 e o vimos ao longo desta campanha nos jovens que estavam votando pela primeira vez e nas pessoas de cora o jovem que voltaram a se envolver em pol tica depois de longos hiatos o vimos nos republicanos que jamais acreditavam que votariam tamb m nas prim rias democratas mas acabaram por faz lo
8965166 eu o vi eu o vi nos trabalhadores que decidiram reduzir suas jornadas di rias de trabalho ainda que isso fosse prejudic los economicamente para evitar que seus colegas fossem demitidos nos soldados que voltam a se alistar mesmo depois de perder um membro nos bons vizinhos que acolhem um desconhecido quando chegam os furac es e as guas da inunda o recobrem um bairro
8965167 este nosso pa s tem mais riqueza do que qualquer outra na o mas n o isso que nos torna ricos
8965168 em lugar disso o esp rito americano a promessa dos estados unidos que nos propele mesmo quando o caminho incerto que nos mant m unidos a despeito de nossas diferen as que nos faz ter em vista n o aquilo que podemos ver mas aquilo que ainda n o podemos o lugar melhor que deve surgir logo que dobrarmos a curva
8965169 e foi essa promessa que h 45 anos levou norte americanos de todos os cantos do pa s a se unirem no mall de washington diante do memorial de lincoln para ouvir um jovem pregador da ge rgia falar sobre o seu sonho
8965170 mas o que as pessoas ouviram em lugar disso pessoas de todos os credos e cores de todas as profiss es foi que na am rica nosso destino est inextricavelmente ligado ao dos demais cidad os e que unidos podemos ter um sonho comum
8965171 e ao caminharmos devemos assumir o compromisso de que sempre marcharemos adiante n o podemos recuar
8965172 n o quando ainda resta tanto a fazer n o com tantas crian as a educar tantas veteranos de guerra a atender n o com uma economia a reparar e cidades a reconstruir e fazendas a salvar n o com tantas fam lias a proteger e tantas vidas a retificar
8965173 neste momento nesta elei o devemos prometer uma vez mais marchar em dire o ao futuro
8965174 nos apeguemos firmemente e sem hesita o esperan a que confessamos
8965175 in regard to the circumstances we played under this week only tough people can do that

8965197 aerial gunning of wolves is strongly opposed by the masses because it is considered barbaric unethical and nearly impossible to regulate
8965198 im still not quite sure why obama didnt try and lock that vote down by overlooking the personal animosity he and clinton shared and picking her as his running mate but he didnt

8965210 shes an executive shes a reformer and she is going to be a great leader for our country
8965211 she has executive experience and as i said before senator obama has not
8965212 i am disappointed i thought he pawlenty would be a very good choice
8965213 hes certainly a great republican candidate maybe the time isnt right maybe next time
8965214 this election isnt about me this election is about you
8965215 i would believe it all evolved but i just dont have that much faith
8965216 so on the serious side now how do they go after obama not being qualified does anyone honestly believe that if mccain dies in office that palin is ready to lead the us

8965226 having worked with actors for many years i find it hard to believe that anyone would have to be dragged kicking and screaming into show business
8965227 but the next time that you see a chimpanzee in a movie on tv or in an ad chances are thats exactly what happened its a sad story that starts when the animals are babies when they are torn away from their mothers and forced to depend upon human trainers great ape mothers are fiercely protective of their newborns which means that they must be tricked sedated or forcibly restrained when their infants are pulled from their arms this cruel practice leaves lifelong emotional scars on both the mothers who go into a deep depression and the babies
8965228 by age 8 young chimpanzees used in the entertainment industry have grown too strong to be handled and they are usually discarded often at dismal roadside zoos or pseudo sanctuaries there they languish for decades chimpanzees can live to age 60 in barren cages or dank depressing concrete cells

8965232 its about action i can talk they can talk we can all talk
8965233 its not hard to do that but it doesnt make any difference so its about actions
8965234 im confident they can do it and i hope theyre confident they can do it
8965235 i think guys will be steeling themselves for it and it could really set our season alight
8965236 collectively we definitely have a point to prove regardless of whether youre out of contract old or young
8965237 the group has responded to probably every challenge that has been thrown at them over the past six years
8965238 we started off the season people said we couldnt make the eight weve done that again there are now some questions about us again and hopefully we can answer those questions also
8965239 its a challenge because we are obviously not playing well but ive still got enormous faith in this group and the team and the players that we can turn it around
8965240 weve got two weeks to do it starting tonight can we win next week we absolutely can next week if we play our best footy and get our guys into some form
8965241 and thats the challenge for all of us to get back into form
8965242 nows the time to set our team up with the best possible players we think we can do some damage in the finals
8965243 clearly with luke and nick malceski they are two of our better players so its a real chance for them to come back in less pressure just go out and play some football and play yourself back into some form
8965244 i just think they are a group finding it really hard to come up with answers and as a coach my message to them is that the answers are on the field
8965245 the answers wont be found in a video session a gameplan book or what have you
8965246 the answers are out there on the scg and they are very very simple and what i say in the media what adam goodes says in the media what brett kirk says in the media all that is irrelevant really
8965247 it is about what can a player control when he goes on the field
8965248 he can control whether he wins the ball or lets his man win the ball or he makes a tackle or the guy slips out of the tackle
8965249 thats the challenge for the group to not worry too much about why but just remember how they did it and go and do it again
8965250 it amp squo s about action i can talk they can talk we can all talk
8965251 i am off to the physio but i should be right

8965261 mackey murders an internal affairs rat in cold blood he kills a cop shoots him in the head
8965262 and when i read that i thought to myself shawn ryan will never get this ending on the air
8965263 i think one thing that helped me was frankly my ignorance
8965264 i had not done a lot of tv producing at that point i had written for a couple of shows angel nash bridges but i wasnt involved in a lot of production decisions i didnt have any kind of preconceived notions about how these things were supposed to be done
8965265 we didnt want the show to be 85 percent of a network show even though we had 85 percent of the budget
8965266 a lot of other shows have a tendency to try to glamorize the characters
8965267 working on this show they like it if you have circles under your eyes
8965268 it wasnt solely because of the creative success of the shield and fxs nip tuck but a lot of it was the economic success of the shield it inspired people to get into this original series business because we were making the show for a price that made sense
8965269 but thats the nature of tv and film its not the same as copying a test in school
8965270 i cant say i was lying in the weeds waiting to change television i just took the circumstances i was in and did the best i could with them and i think other people in my same position would have found similar ways to do things i do like the fact that we were sort of the first to do it
8965271 he and i had both been on police ride alongs him as research for being an actor on homicide me when i was a writer on nash bridges
8965272 i just said to clark i just want the viewer to feel like theyre on a police ride along and thats what he brought to it
8965273 we were able to make the pilot in such a go for it style that we eventually won the day i think on execution i think our director out directed their director i think we out cast their show they had jason priestly playing a drug addict and that seemed like a casting coup at the time because nobody wanted to put themselves in an fx show
8965274 some roles are exhausting physically some are exhausting mentally some are really devastating psychologically vic is all of that
8965275 you ever take a face cloth and soak it and wring it out thats me at the end of the day im a wrung out washcloth an overcooked noodle
8965276 an inordinate amount of focus is required to do our work on this job and its not just the words its not just the density and the complexities of the story its the traffic its the noises on the street
8965277 really it harkens back to that jack nicholson speech in a few good men
8965278 he is the embodiment of that argument i am the man on the wall you people who sit in your suburban households can look at what i do from a distance and go
8965279 one thing i learned from joss whedon that i blatantly stole was the idea of approaching the stories first from character
8965280 the cop stories were always the last thing wed figure out on a shield episode
8965281 you just start from the premise of what do you want to happen to vic and shane this week what do you want to happen to fellow cops dutch and claudette or danny and julien or vics ex wife corrine what hoops do you want them to jump through and then you figure out what are the best stories that allow you to do that

8965480 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8965481 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8965482 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8965483 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8965484 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8965485 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8965486 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8965487 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8965488 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8965489 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8965490 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8965491 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8965492 who are open to doing something on the production side
8965493 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8965494 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8965495 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8965496 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8965497 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8965498 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

8965511 life is a series of problems either you are in one now youre just coming out of one or youre getting ready to go into another one the reason for this is that god is more interested in your character than your comfort he is more interested in making your life holy than he is in making it happy we can be reasonably happy here on this earth but that is not the goal of life the goal is to grow in character in christs likeness

8965519 i was driving through shevington when i noticed something out of the corner of my eye hovering above some houses my first thought was that it was a helicopter but after a while i noticed it wasnt moving at all and wasnt making any sound and it looked to be in two pieces
8965520 i pulled over and kept watching it and it was the strangest thing then a chinook helicopter flew close by followed by another type of helicopter it might be me but they seemed to be checking it out
8965521 i had my video camera in my car with me so i took some footage of the object it was there in the sky perfectly visible then it just disappeared from my viewfinder

8965543 our own investigations agree with the atsbs preliminary conclusions dixon said
8965544 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
8965545 found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men 15 other villagers were wounded or otherwise injured
8965546 the afghan people and the afghan government have lost their patience
8965547 we cannot see our children being killed in our villages or the killing of innocent people and our hope and strong request is to reach a new agreement with the international community which clarifies all the conditions so that in the future the fight against terrorism should happen in the boundary of law so that civilians are not affected
8965548 the prospect of codifying the ad hoc rules under which u s forces have operated in afghanistan since late 2001 sends shudders through the bush administration
8965549 so youd have a multiplicity of players on that side
8965550 to us and the u s and afghan troops we were covering it appeared as though they were victorious
8965551 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8965552 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8965553 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8965554 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8965555 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8965556 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8965557 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8965558 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8965559 i think her selection would be something similar to dan quayle dan quayle proved to be sort of an embarrassment as a campaigner being thrust on a national stage like that could be very tough
8965560 now mondale tried to shake things up by going with geraldine ferraro she proved to be a disaster as a running mate and as a campaigner she was absolutely awful
8965561 and so i just think that it is very risky for mccain to do this but it may be all he has left
8965562 weder georgien in russland noch russland in georgien werden diplomatische vertretungen haben
8965563 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8965564 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8965565 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8965566 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8965567 in wolfsburg haben wir immer ganz gut ausgesehen und ausw rts sind wir stark

8965569 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8965570 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8965571 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8965572 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8965573 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8965574 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8965575 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8965576 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8965577 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8965578 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8965579 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8965580 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8965581 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8965582 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8965583 we will as a matter of urgency review these documents and within the constraints of national security follow up any matters arising especially as they may pertain to any allegations or evidence of irregularities or wrongdoing relating to the arms deal
8965584 clear up the matter of the south african governments co operation or lack thereof in the investigations into the arms deal
8965585 by accessing the mlas we would be able to hold government to account in terms of whether it assisted the german and british investigations
8965586 we believe that the german investigation was abandoned because of a lack of co operation from south africa and we suspect that the british investigation may likewise also be ended due to a singular lack of assistance from the government
8965587 when you buy 5 strikes puts when the stock is trading over 50 you either have to be manipulating or you have to have insider information

8965595 according to a recent study by the media research center nbc news has the most lopsided pro obama coverage among national tv news operations the mrc found that pro obama reports outnumber anti obama reports by 10 to one on nbc news an amazing statistic

8965629 virginia was sitting right across the aisle from us and i saw a lady with a terrible towel on her head we struck up a conversation then there was someone from new york who came over who also was a steelers fan
8965630 i met some folks from west virginia and was talking to people from ohio that i didnt know
8965631 he talked of the fact that we need jobs his economic plans and wouldnt it be wonderful to have energy independence and he said wed have it within 10 years

8965640 vencidos los 210 d as una de esas empresas cliba dijo que no iba a seguir prestando el servicio si no se le reconoc an algunas mejoras
8965641 a nosotros nos preocupa que hay dos empresas que durante dos a os van a estar con una pr rroga de una licitaci n las estamos beneficiando econ micamente pero adem s no invierten m s porque no saben si se quedan o se van entonces la negligencia de los funcionarios p blicos en no llamar a licitaci n en el momento que correspond a hace que hoy la ciudad est en malas condiciones de limpieza
8965642 russia completely lost the information war in the first few days
8965643 then they realised the mistake and hit back they rolled out the general staff and then these interviews by medvedev
8965644 they have done better than they used to but they have a very long way to go
8965645 yes naturally certain conclusions will be made from this situation
8965646 practice has shown that a confrontation in such situations is not limited to armed conflict and diplomatic battles but is carried through into the communications sphere
8965647 unlike the georgian side which has been praised by some for a successful information campaign russia had not prepared for this war and was concerned above all not with the polemics of saakashvili but with the defence of its citizens
8965648 in this information war we still have much to do we have already spoken about this and we have received some very serious experience in the current situation

8965660 ive witnessed qualitystocks growth from a small investor newsletter with a handful of subscribers to a leading multi million dollar pr brand within the small cap markets in a relatively short period of time

8965663 we are in the process of talking to the government theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us we always worry a little bit but we think our arguments are pretty strong yahoo has made it very very clear theyre going to take the best parts of their network and ours and combine them

8965701 we want to fix the shortage instead of creating a situation where hospitals have to shift the nursing workload to lesser trained workers
8965702 if the shortage worsens institutions would look for more ways to shift duties to nursing aides a process already well under way

8965725 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8965726 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8965727 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal

8965758 the reasons people file for personal bankruptcy indeed have shifted during the past couple of decades
8965759 although our research supports the notion that adverse life events like losing ones health or job contribute to personal bankruptcy filings excessive consumption contributes more to the recent increase in personal bankruptcy filing
8965760 our results emphasize that bankruptcy law reform should aim to address the issue
8965761 current means test focusing on income rather than consumption patterns or adverse events may not set the best criteria for sorting out the households who truly need bankruptcy protection from those that consume beyond their means to take advantage of the system

8965810 mr busskohl stated that he would then either stab the potential victim in the chest or slash his throat mr busskohl told mr eischens that he would then either cut off the eyelids of the victim or cut out his heart

8965812 the evidence i received he busskohl discussed very openly these things with the police
8965813 within eight to 10 hours the bizarre type of thinking he was undergoing was gone
8965814 if anybody were to meet him and talk to him at this point he represents no threat to anyone
8965815 i didnt even look at it as a murder plot until they actually started putting it on the news
8965816 what bothers me is if you throw a rock hes about four blocks away
8965817 which is a substantial step toward and more than preparation for the commission of the crime
8965818 but if we have somebody thats just simply preparing to commit the crime and does not take a substantial step toward committing that crime we cant charge an attempt and thats what this is all about

8965897 ive been following the housing market for 35 years and im as pessimistic today as ive ever been wood said the current downturn rivals the economic woes utah experienced during the 1980s he added

8965905 prices for new homes a prime indicator of land values are still falling once considered a fairly scarce resource land suitable for development looks a lot more plentiful now white said
8965906 the average selling price for new single family homes in the first six months of this year dropped 19 6 percent from the first half of 2006 according to hanley wood the average price per square foot dropped 11 percent over that time according to the data
8965907 sahuarita and green valley new home sales are still pretty strong but prices have taken a big hit mainly because of heavy competition among builders white said hanley wood data show an 18 8 percent drop in the average new home selling price from 2006 the average price per square foot fell by an even steeper 19 5 percent
8965908 southwest side prices were sharply inflated here and are falling hard as builders discount heavily to get rid of inventory white said development may take a while to pick up again as builders work through remaining lots he said the average new home selling price fell 23 1 percent this year from the first half of 2006 according to hanley wood the average price per square foot fell 21 8 percent
8965909 home prices may be off nearly 30 percent in las vegas prompting many to predict the worst of the housing crisis may be over but some realtors know another round of foreclosures may happen in the next few months flooding the valley with vacant homes and people have two things to blame liars and ninjas
8965910 they may be new terms for a lot of us but liar loans and ninja loans helped push the housing market to the brink of collapse now the rates are changing again in september and the scars from those liars and ninjas run deep
8965911 many consider them the villains in the housing crisis and realtor cynthia glickman says their reputation has been tarnished oh yeah look at these people you know
8965912 they assumed the values of the homes were going to go up so they figured whats the worst that could happen said glickman
8965913 the lenders were caught up partly in greed partly in speculation hoping the sky high housing market would keep rising now the market seems headed for recovery but glickman warns the liars and ninjas have one last sneak attack theres going to be another wave of people for probably another good three years said glickman
8965914 off the strip in the residential neighborhoods where the housing boom once burned hottest realtors say the market is starting to reach equilibrium that is the number of homes going into foreclosure every month is almost matched by the number of homes being sold out of foreclosure
8965915 michael antos of prudential americana group just sold a home out of foreclosure for 350 000 that originally sold for 579 000 to sell the house the bank not only slashed the price but put in new carpet hardwood floors and appliances
8965916 trump tower up the road is reportedly struggling trump like others built a condo hotel a development which includes hotel rooms and also condos which could be rented out as hotel rooms many of these including trumps were announced as 100 percent sold before a shovel went into the ground
8965917 the problem is that many of the buyers were investors who couldnt get financing when it came time to close the deals claims of 100 percent sold fell to more like 50 percent or less
8965918 the most shocking part of a new report on the las vegas resort development pipeline isnt that despite the economy there are still more than 40 000 new rooms expected to be built by the end of 2012 the stunner is the dominance of high end rooms
8965919 a new report by deutsche bank quantifies the strip development pipeline and points out that 89 percent of the new supply will be in the luxury category it is too much says analyst bill lerner who wrote the report
8965920 according to the report nearly 36 000 rooms added from 2008 through 2012 will be luxury those include more than 3 000 at palazzo and nearly 1 300 at trump las vegas both of which are already open
8965921 after that the projections get dicey they include nearly 10 000 rooms at the proposed plaza and elvis hotels neither of which is off the ground it also includes 5 300 at echelon which is now on hold
8965922 when asked why resort developers would invest so much money in a market when they know competitors are building similar projects he said the answer was simple everyone thinks their project will be the best the problem is only one will be right and the rest will be scrapping for business from a finite pool
8965923 the view is that it is always somebody elses problem lerner said of over saturation
8965924 at the formal meeting with creditors on aug 14 developer william plise made a passing reference to finding new equity partners to restart construction which halted shortly after the chapter 11 filing on june 2 however the reorganization plan filed in july mentions only selling the 126 acre site
8965925 at this point lawyers for city crossing and its lenders are trying to negotiate a settlement of the two major differences between them how to sell the land and how to deal with plises guarantees to cover any shortfall between the value of the land and the mortgage balances
8965926 the future sale and development of city crossing as a whole far outweighs the value of liquidating the project site to discount shopping buyers that are presently in the market according to court documents filed by city crossing
8965927 in this case fetching the highest possible price is important not only to the lenders a mix of banks individuals and trusts but to plise himself because he personally guaranteed all loans in the event the land sale does not repay all the loans in full he would have to dip into his own bank accounts or sell other properties he owns to cover any shortfall
8965928 in its most recent version the master plan called for 1 million square feet of offices 1 million square feet of shopping two hotels and 2 500 condos and apartments
8965929 a measure proposed by councilman bob fitzgerald and drafted by assistant city attorney jack byron would target lenders in order to enforce maintenance standards

8965951 while britains athletes may have won more medals than usual they must remember that they are tainted with the blood of tibetans falun gong practitoners and roman catholic priests who are being tortured and held in labour camps just a few miles from the glittering birds nest stadium
8965952 told the international olympic committee to put it in the post
8965953 the mayors support for our athletes as they return from beijing has been totally undermined by one of his senior appointments mr coleman has gone out of his way to personally attack insult and disparage the remarkable achievements of the british team
8965954 while the rest of the country have seen how uplifting success at the olympics can be and have swung behind london 2012 mr colemans gross insult does nothing but undermine and embarrass the city we should be giving our young athletes all the resources and support possible not rubbishing and going out of our way to put them down
8965955 quite frankly boris johnson should sack him we just cant have senior members of the mayors team attacking olympic heroes in this fashion
8965956 brian coleman is entitled to his views on the olympics which is a matter of taste and political opinion but it is preposterous to suggest that boris johnson was forced to go to beijing he did so with great enthusiam and is extremely grateful to his hosts it was a very proud moment to receive the olympic flag on behalf of london for the 2012 games
8965957 it is offensive to suggest so when these fine young men and women are not only doing britain proud but are helping to open china to the world and the world to china
8965958 frankly i am disappointed at what i know to be the reasoning for the pick
8965959 the reason james baker was persuaded to select a female from alaska was the notion that disaffected hillary clinton females would be attracted to the mccain ticket
8965960 the 27 percent of hillary clinton supporters who say they arent going to vote for the democratic ticket
8965961 i think those pro choice pro hillary middle to lower middle class white voters followed hillary for ideological reasons and arent going to be easily switched to a pro life republican nra card holding governor from alaska who theyve never heard of
8965962 hes been vetted hes been through a campaign he would be ready on day 1 to be president should something happen to mccain
8965963 im sure shes a lovely lady but im sure she has a resume thats as thin as barack obamas
8965964 god forbid what happens if two or three years into mccains term he becomes ill
8965965 its the top of the ticket that makes history not second place

8966039 i am well aware that there are catholic schools that make it their mission to do that to look after those disadvantaged kids
8966040 when we analyse how those schools are going we obviously are going to find that they confront a range of challenges given the student populations that they are teaching
8966041 theyve made it their vocation to make a difference to those kids and we obviously want to help them make a difference
8966042 that is why we are talking about additional resources for those schools

8966071 we hadden donderdag een productieve testdag ik hoop dat we straks in monza onze goede vorm kunnen vasthouden en onze vierde plek in het constructeurskampioenschap met succes kunnen verdedigen we hebben ons vooral gefocust op de zaken die het belangrijkst zijn op dit circuit de effici nte a rodynamische afstelling een goed gevoel over de remmen en het comfortabel over de kerbstones kunnen rijden ik ben tevreden over de geboekte vooruitgang
8966072 we zijn keihard hard aan het werk om de juiste afstellingen te vinden voor dit circuit
8966073 daarnaast besteden we natuurlijk veel aandacht aan de betrouwbaarheid van de auto en de manier waarop de wagen zich gedraagt op de kerbstones van monza met dat laatste hadden vorig jaar nog wat problemen volgens mij werkt alles nu prima maar dat weten we natuurlijk pas echt zeker na afloop van de kwalificatie voor de italiaanse grand prix
8966074 we hebben ons niet alleen voorbereid op de grand prix van itali maar ook op andere races die voor de deur staan zoals de grand prix van belgi het was over het geheel genomen een goede testsessie ook al hebben we op de eerste testdag meer informatie kunnen verzamelen dan op de tweede testdag nu kijk ik uit naar de race in belgi

8966080 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
8966081 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
8966082 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono

8966089 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile

8966092 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano

8966098 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
8966099 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

8966104 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
8966105 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8966106 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8966107 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
8966108 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
8966109 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
8966110 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
8966111 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
8966112 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema

8966117 crediamo che alla scuola serva chiarezza ha spiegato il ministro per questo ci sar un ritorno dei voti accompagnati dai giudizi che saranno esplicativi del risultato raggiunto dai ragazzi

8966140 what we have done over the last few weeks is actively manage our business
8966141 we do not have any retrenchment plans for our staff but we have reduced the use of agency staff as we have told the market
8966142 certainly the board hasnt given me that indication and neither have the shareholders
8966143 i will be guided by what they want right now i still think im the best person to get us through this point in time and get us to the other side
8966144 i know this business very well ive been doing it for 20 years and im very focused on the australian and new zealand businesses
8966145 we are making sure we go through the balance sheet line by line and anything that looks like it is impaired in any way we are tidying it up
8966146 the parents are still paying fees and the government still pays a fair portion so its a good operation
8966147 i suppose im a bit frustrated when people say there is a very strong possibility that the abc will fall over when thats just not the case
8966148 the biggest message for me is that its business as normal
8966149 i will not quit at this moment i will not declare emergency rule i will wait and see tomorrow
8966150 the duration of the closure will depend on how the situation develops
8966151 there will be no coup because a coup will not be able to solve the problems

8966163 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8966164 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8966165 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8966166 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8966167 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8966168 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8966169 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8966170 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8966171 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8966172 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8966173 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8966174 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8966175 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8966176 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8966177 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8966178 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8966179 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8966180 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8966181 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8966182 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8966183 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8966184 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8966185 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8966186 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8966187 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8966188 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8966189 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8966190 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8966191 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8966192 warum hat die angeklagte gelogen wenn sie nichts zu verbergen hat
8966193 er war immer ein freigeist und querdenker das ist er auch in der kunst
8966194 fr her war das der bestm gliche anzug heute das bestm gliche objekt
8966195 a maverick with a record of reform has chosen a maverick with a record of reform john mccain is putting washington on notice that theres a shake up coming
8966196 shes a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that shes ready to be president
8966197 growth will be close to our earlier assessment of 8 per cent and growth of 8 per cent or a little lower is nothing to be scoffed at
8966198 we dont know for sure because nobody is keeping tabs of the dead
8966199 what we do know is we have 155 live penguins we are treating for oil intoxication
8966200 though the prices may come down but its a difficult business to run
8966201 we have serious grounds to think that there were us citizens right in the combat zone
8966202 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8966203 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8966204 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in inter ethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8966205 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of us president
8966206 it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8966207 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8966208 we dont want us ships to come here if it will start a war
8966209 it could trigger a battle and we dont want that if the russians and americans want to fight let them do it in their own countries georgia isnt a battlefield
8966210 despite the apparent strength of the nato naval group in the black sea a single salvo from the moskva missile cruiser and two or three missile boats would be enough to annihilate the entire group within 20 minutes the waters would be clear
8966211 we will not strike first and they do not look like people with suicidal tendencies
8966212 the increased capability and coordination in past three years shows us that state tribal local and federal agencies and resources of the national guard are much improved we are still planning and coordinating to provide unique areas of additional capabilities to the right place as needed such as search and rescue and medical transportation
8966213 we are thankful that we did not receive any reports of new attacks last night however there are literally thousands of displaced christians whose homes were destroyed in the mob violence hundreds more are afraid to return home
8966214 the violence in towns and cities seems to be over but the villages face the strong possibility of more attacks since security forces are spread thin we still are requesting military intervention
8966215 udit raj a major dalit leader and other non christian human rights activists clearly explained that the violence in orissa is not because christians are fraudulently converting people that allegation is simply lie and hate propaganda
8966216 and spellbinding in a way usually reserved for works of fiction almost a fully realized tough crisp insistent speech in tone in the sense of cutting through the clutter id love to find something to criticize about it
8966217 you know ive been criticized for saying he inspires me to hell with my critics
8966218 let me tell you what was great about obamas speech
8966219 what he did was and its a military practice its called attacking from a defensive position you take your opponents best shot and you throw it back at him
8966220 he took the last eight years of the bush administration and shouted at america enough
8966221 your observation about this as a historical military struggle in its precision is right on there
8966222 on monday night as host joe scarborough described a surge in the polls that had mccain pulling even with obama olbermann could be
8966223 two ways there are one of life and one of death and there is a great difference between the two ways
8966224 do not kill a fetus by abortion or commit infanticide
8966225 if we consider not only how extensively attacks on life are spreading but also their unheard of numerical proportion
8966226 the point is is that it when life begins shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8966227 i remember music i remember her and i remember love
8966228 when we gave gvg they would steadily lose weight and when we took them off gvg they would steadily gain weight
8966229 it was like a roller coaster it was also dose dependent rats given higher doses would lose more weight
8966230 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8966231 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8966232 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8966233 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8966234 no one works for someone we all just work together
8966235 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8966236 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8966237 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8966238 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8966239 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8966240 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8966241 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8966242 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8966243 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8966244 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

8966252 this sends a message that washington is committed to taiwans defense
8966253 and with some sort of framework for improved cross strait relations under consideration taiwan needs to bargain from a position of strength
8966254 but the fact is unless these harpoons have some sort of magical power anything that costs 90 million isnt going to dramatically tip the balance one way or the other
8966255 my guess is that the administration was waiting until the olympics were over so as not to embarrass president hu jintao and the chinese leadership
8966256 now that bush has returned my expectation is that we will see a number of sales move ahead to congress for review in the weeks ahead
8966257 it seems there isnt urgency to move forward and perhaps even a preference to leave this decision to bushs successor

8966302 u s personal spending growth for july has set a tough act for consumption in the third quarter
8966303 at 0 4 in real terms in july real spending in august and september is going to have to be extremely good for the third quarter as a whole not to register zero to negative growth
8966304 a heavily distorted data set giving an unrealistically optimistic picture of the underlying strength of the economy 3q08 gdp should be more representative
8966305 overall there are a lot of negatives for consumption right now and precious few positives
8966306 with consumption falling we suspect that the overall economy will contract too even after allowing for the strength of exports
8966307 the market is quite a bit firmer this morning with this report adding some tone as the income figures point to slower spending but probably a bit of relief that the overall was not firmer its not about the data very much

8966346 breaking off diplomatic relations with tbilisi is not moscows choice and the responsibility lies with tbilisi
8966347 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
8966348 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8966349 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
8966350 we dont foresee any sanctions decided on by the european council
8966351 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia
8966352 we did have lots of contacts with georgia over a long period of time
8966353 georgia found it too hard to hold that line when they were seeing what russia was preparing to do
8966354 we travel for travels sake where few go is the place where a traveler can breathe free
8966355 what you put out into the world comes back to you you actually change the world with what you do i want to put some good in the world
8966356 weve been able to pick things that offer the biggest value
8966357 a strong indication of the macro environment getting a lot worse

8966361 the market is conjuring up images of a replay of three years ago when katrina wreaked havoc on the refinery system in the gulf so were seeing a little spike from that
8966362 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
8966363 if this turns out to be a nonevent the market could really come roaring back down
8966364 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
8966365 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday
8966366 u s oil demand is currently 1 6 million barrels a day lower than when katrina struck
8966367 there is today more u s refining capacity offline for economic reasons than can be destroyed by gustav
8966368 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
8966369 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
8966370 despite this sluggish u s economy the general demand picture is better than it was post 9 11
8966371 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees
8966372 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
8966373 the reality is and i dont want to diminish this the industry is going to have to cover its costs
8966374 if there are fewer flights that wont bother me but if flights are really expensive i just wont go or ill go by myself instead of bringing my son and husband
8966375 and then youre good to go you dont have to worry about that
8966376 a very very small number of people would have purchased tickets for travel in september or thereafter before the flights were taken out of the fall schedule in may and june of this year
8966377 i think if oil prices continue to go down you will hear calls for relaxation of fuel surcharges but that doesnt mean they wont hike base airfares
8966378 i dont think most people in every aspect of their trip will notice a difference
8966379 if there is a silver lining it may be that as a result of fewer overall operations they may see better on time performance

8966453 die bahn wettbewerbe in china waren die beste vorbereitung f r diesen kurzen und verwinkelten prolog das hat mir sicher geholfen
8966454 ich habe nicht mit einer top platzierung gerechnet denn so kurze strecken sind nichts f r mich eigentlich lief es sogar besser als erwartet

8966460 wir wollen keine zweifel an der qualifikation f r die em endrunde 2009 in schweden aufkommen lassen und beide begegnungen gewinnen das wird sicher keine leichte aufgabe aber die mannschaft hat das potenzial dazu diese herausforderung zu bew ltigen
8966461 nordirland ist robust und zweikampfstark au erdem spielt das team sehr gut bereits im hinspiel haben sie uns das leben schwer gemacht israel hat ebenfalls ein hervorragendes team einige ihrer akteure haben bereits bei der u21 europameisterschaft im vergangenen jahr internationale erfahrung gesammelt
8966462 since that first contact we have come out here whenever they have needed help
8966463 its an incredible sense of community we have a large school we wanted to make sure when the kids came back that it was beautiful so they could take pride in it
8966464 the students will have new shoes and well have a new coat of paint
8966465 we saw an opportunity for them to come in and help spruce up the school and make it more warm and inviting for the students facility and staff and also the parents that come in
8966466 im retired military and to see them come out like that really made me proud
8966467 i think david moyes is just looking as we are for loans
8966468 theres a shortage of money out there in the world at the moment it seems
8966469 although sunderland have signed a few players most clubs have not really been spending like they used to and i think they will be spending less and less
8966470 i can see it getting tighter wages have gone up expenses are higher lots of people involved in businesses are struggling
8966471 and clubs are selling players who not long ago you wouldnt expect them to sell
8966472 they are players you thought they wanted to keep so that they could push on and push on and build
8966473 suddenly it has gone the opposite way and one or two other clubs have come in and taken the opportunity to strengthen
8966474 for me as i keep saying it will be the toughest premier league ever look at the other sides
8966475 sunderland are a possible top 10 team this season stoke have just come up but they will be strong they showed that in beating villa
8966476 but certain clubs will still spend certain owners have mega money
8966477 our owner has been fantastic and given us great backing but he knows hes got to balance the books
8966478 if you buy people youve got to sell others to pay for them thats how it should be really
8966479 at pompey i suppose that in the long term weve also got to finance a new training ground and in time a new stadium as well

8966481 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8966482 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8966483 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8966484 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8966485 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8966486 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8966487 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8966488 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8966489 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8966490 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8966491 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8966492 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8966493 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8966494 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8966495 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8966496 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8966497 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8966498 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8966499 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest

8966501 brownie del works like hell and wont it be a sin that when he gets up to those pearly gates they wont let his money in
8966502 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus

8966505 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8966506 at at the end of the third reich collapse there was a dash across europe to recover v 2 missiles and components
8966507 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8966508 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8966509 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8966510 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8966511 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8966512 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8966513 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8966514 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8966515 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8966516 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8966517 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8966518 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8966519 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8966520 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8966521 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8966522 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8966523 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8966524 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8966525 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8966526 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8966527 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8966528 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8966529 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8966530 these agreements allow sgoi to act upon a key strategic initiative by not only diversifying its supply source for organic iqf individual quick frozen vegetables and fruits but also allowing the group to get much closer to the farm gate in a rapidly developing and reputable region for the procurement of commodities which are in global short supply
8966531 sunopta has bought a number of organic ingredient companies in the last few years with the global organic food industry continuing to show high growth many organic food companies are struggling to find adequate supply of organic ingredients
8966532 sunopta is looking to develop global supply chains for organic ingredients to meet this challenge its strategic partnerships in central america are part of this objective
8966533 it is now one of the few organic food companies with a significant global presence
8966534 we intend to leverage the new customer and supply relationships in order to expand supply of various organic food products processed at existing sunopta operations and also leverage sunoptas extensive global expertise to bring a number of these products to markets serviced by tradin organics a recent sunopta acquisition

8966536 aber so gut wie erhofft war das noch nicht wir haben noch einiges an arbeit vor uns wenn wir den abstand zu casey verringern wollen im moment ist mein hauptproblem die vierte kurve in der ich ziemlich langsam bin wir m ssen die daten studieren und herausfinden woran das liegt
8966537 daher hoffe ich dass ich morgen noch n her dran bin denn alle sind sehr konkurrenzf hig also m ssen wir hart arbeiten wir haben schon einige gute ideen und werden nun sehen was sich machen l sst es ist klasse bei sonnenschein in der heimat zu fahren auf der strecke auf der ich mein erstes rennen bestritten habe es wird sicher ein fantastisches wochenende f r die fans
8966538 nach br nn hatten wir einen guten test und heute habe ich das gef hl dass die michelin reifen hier schon viel besser sind dadurch f hle ich mich sicherer ich will keine prognosen wagen denn zuerst m ssen wir morgen einmal abwarten ob es in dieser tonart weitergeht ich glaube ich kann mich weiter steigern denn alles f hlt sich viel besser an als vor zwei wochen
8966539 es sieht besser aus als bei den vergangenen beiden rennen
8966540 der br nn test war sehr wichtig um die situation zu verbessern aber wir m ssen noch mehr mit michelin daran arbeiten den grip zu verbessern denn wir sind noch immer nicht dort wo wir eigentlich sein m chten
8966541 ich wei dass die zeichen recht gut f r uns stehen um in oschersleben ein gutes ergebnis einzufahren
8966542 ich mag diese strecke und wir sind dort eigentlich immer konkurrenzf hig au erdem bin ich sehr motiviert wenn du einen monat lang keine rennen gefahren bist dann hast du unglaublich viel lust aufs fahren
8966543 mein hauptziel ist die vorderen platzierungen zu st rmen und im rennen eine ordentliche pace zu zeigen daf r ist es nat rlich wichtig dass das qualifying passt und das wird schon die erste herausforderung des wochenendes werden
8966544 ich bin aber zuversichtlich mein auto ist klasse und seat macht einen richtig guten job dabei alle unterschiedlichen f den in der hand zu halten die beiden siege verleihen mir klarerweise noch eine extraportion motivation und lassen mich auch die schwierigkeiten vergessen dich im laufe der saison schon gehabt habe
8966545 die wtcc ist eine der konkurrenzf higsten weltmeisterschaften und all die vorteile die seat sich hart erarbeitet hat wurden von zwischenf llen in den rennen zunichte gemacht wobei wir unschuldige opfer waren
8966546 das handtuch werfen wir deswegen nat rlich nicht die arbeit des gesamten teams baut die fahrer noch mehr auf

8966548 in spite of the rapid dispersal of the economic stimulus payments in the april to july period consumers pulled back on real spending in both june and july in the face of weak employment conditions higher energy prices and further declines in household net worth
8966549 with the tax refund effect on spending now more or less over we think the worst is yet to come for consumers and we expect an outright decline in real q3 third quarter consumption
8966550 this means so much to our department and to the future of our department
8966551 so not only are they taking advantage of the generosity theyre really working hard
8966552 a more educated police officer is a better police officer

8966560 each of these tragedies could have been prevented simply by not leaving children alone near water or in vehicles
8966561 children should never be left unsupervised for any period of time near water or in any vehicle because the results can be devastating if you cant see them you cant save them
8966562 when a child is in the back seat it is a good idea to put a purse or briefcase there too or keep a stuffed animal in the car seat and when the child is there put the stuffed animal in the front seat those are both good reminders

8966603 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8966604 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

8966640 it is beyond question that by acting in the way that he did mr khan killed mr brown unlawfully and whatever their differences the fact is that mr brown lost his life

8966652 wonder if the downs had anything to do with her flying when she was 8 mos pregnant thats the kind of judgment im looking for in the white house
8966653 she once tried to get a cop in alaska fired allegedly
8966654 i like mccain too bad he is running right now because the republicans need to be taught a lesson
8966655 alaska needs to be self sufficient she says instead of relying heavily on federal dollars as the state does today
8966656 youre brave to do that and youre horrible for expecting other people to try and be more courageous too

8966685 i will just move on and i want even worry about the pec endorsement and take my name off the list
8966686 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
8966687 raping a 13 year old girl in a church shows great character i am sure he would have been a great father at 17 do whats best for the girl leave her where she is with loving stable parents
8966688 tia answer me this do you find it acceptable for a man to have intercourse with a 13 yo girl
8966689 i hope that the justice department will raise some strenuous objections to this deal but the zero hour is upon us
8966690 when we announced our deal with yahoo we agreed to give the department of justice several months to review the deal before we began implementing it and we continue to cooperate with regulators as that process continues
8966691 ultimately we have confidence that theyll be able to conduct their review within that time period and allow us to move forward
8966692 so mccain seeing hes in a direct competition with obama chose someone who can rival the big o in youthful and woefully inexperienced credentials
8966693 the decision to reject mereham is fantastic news for the whole of cambridgeshire
8966694 it would have completely destroyed the lives of the thousands of residents in east cambridgeshire and created havoc on the already congested a10
8966695 the plans that i have seen of it were absolutely staggering the developer suggested 5 000 homes would have had little affect on the road network which if you know the area is amazing
8966696 what this decision goes to show is local people can make a difference when they come together to often we hear stories of how no one listens to the people who will most affected by growth
8966697 yes it can be hard work but everyone who was involved in the say no to mereham campaign can say tonight that they have made a difference and all that effort has been worth it i special mention must go to local councillor bill hunt who has worked tirelessly to stop this proposed town
8966698 ultimately i hope the end of mereham and the recent decision by tesco to pull hanley grange out of the eco town process will be the final death nail to attempts by developers to force through schemes which arent needed or wanted
8966699 growth is something which will never go away but if it is managed with local people becoming part of the process as has happened at northstowe then we can build a future that is welcomed by all

8966705 none of our insight or feedback shows that teaching the holocaust to primary school children breeds racism
8966706 we recognise that teaching the holocaust can be a challenging exercise and teachers must ensure that it is communicated in the right way at the right time so that young people truly learn from what has happened in the past
8966707 however we have been providing free resources to primary school teachers on our website since 2005 advising on effective teaching methods with excellent feedback received and we will continue to do so
8966708 holocaust memorial day aims to teach all people young and old the lessons of what can happen when prejudice racism and bullying go unchecked it is only by learning through the lessons of the past that we can create a better future

8966729 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8966730 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8966731 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8966732 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8966733 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8966734 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8966735 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8966736 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans

8966738 despite the animosity and hatred that exists between asian societies and contributing to it vista office and outlook 2007 are a nightmare
8966739 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8966740 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8966741 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8966742 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8966743 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8966744 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8966745 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8966746 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8966747 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8966748 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8966749 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8966750 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8966751 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8966752 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8966753 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8966754 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8966755 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8966756 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8966757 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8966758 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8966759 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

8966761 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8966762 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8966763 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8966764 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8966765 purtroppo lho fatta in fretta la prossima volta far di meglio
8966766 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8966767 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8966768 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8966769 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8966770 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8966771 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8966772 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8966773 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8966774 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8966775 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
8966776 unsere zeiten sind gut und ber die distanz bleibt das auto ebenfalls recht konstant
8966777 jetzt gilt es diese leistungen am samstag im qualifying zu wiederholen um sich auf diesem engen kurs ideale voraussetzungen f r den sonntag zu schaffen
8966778 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8966779 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8966780 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8966781 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8966782 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8966783 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8966784 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8966785 the outbreak of fighting between two of our member states is of very great concern to all of us in the council of europe
8966786 it is important that we establish by speaking fully and frankly with both sides exactly what happened and why evaluate the situation on the ground and then come together to decide a way forward that is in line with our values
8966787 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8966788 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8966789 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8966790 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8966791 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8966792 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8966793 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8966794 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8966795 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8966796 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8966797 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8966798 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8966799 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8966800 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8966801 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8966802 fizeram um bom trabalho durante a semana e estou convencido que vamos dar uma grande resposta precisamos de concentra o e seguran a mas a equipa est a crescer

8966805 since the death of my grandfather who was also a structural engineer i became very curious in his career and what he did for a living
8966806 i read a few books on civil engineering to better understand what the job included and i became extremely interested in bridges
8966807 knex is a lot stronger than lego because knex works in triangles whereas lego is more like masonry work adding bricks on top of each other
8966808 when he sets his mind to something he really does it
8966809 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

8966834 the 12 men in the car were taken hostage and executed by the insurgents the executions were filmed and posted on the internet the inspector general for the united states department of defense investigated and confirmed the facts related to the fate of the 12 men which led to increased enforcement of anti trafficking measures by the united states

8966839 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
8966840 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
8966841 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him

8966843 governor palin has challenged the influence of the big oil companies while fighting for the development of new energy resources she leads a state that matters to every one of us
8966844 in alaska governor palin challenged a corrupt system and passed a landmark ethics reform bill she has actually used her veto and cut budgetary spending she put a stop to the bridge to nowhere that would have cost taxpayers 400 million dollars
8966845 theres a big difference between a huffy leaning up against a wall and the bike i had

8966847 indicated to the airport the possibility of replacing the plane with another
8966848 however in the end it also told the airport control center that it had decided to continue with the plane which is the one that crashed
8966849 weve been able to pick things that offer the biggest value
8966850 a strong indication of the macro environment getting a lot worse

8966858 la posible ruptura de las relaciones no es elecci n de rusia y toda la responsabilidad por ello recaer sobre georgia
8966859 has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of
8966860 her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
8966861 and biden will not be able to attack her lack of experience without highlighting obamas equal lack of experience
8966862 she went ahead with her last chilbirth even though she knew the baby had down syndrome obama would kill that baby now
8966863 as for the prospect of her being vice president palin told kudlow that she could not answer the question of whether she wanted the job
8966864 hey lookee here i gots me a woman on my ticket i aint no racist or sexist

8966867 in denver it wasnt just about change any more but about cash too
8966868 the defining line running through his nomination speech was not wishes but reality
8966869 i think it has strengthened his position in the campaign whether this now can be balanced by an equally strong performance of mccain waits to be seen
8966870 he was trying to establish his role against a public perception that mccain might be stronger in a crisis situation
8966871 american rhetoric about the american dream in best american style but also a way to give a certain amount of substance to politics and to draw up the border lines to john mccain
8966872 he would be the right future president as long as he does what he promises
8966873 i like his idea to relieve the middle class by reducing taxes
8966874 and a retreat in iraq will be necessary because it is not good for a country to spent too much money on war
8966875 the best of obama as one would say about a music compilation
8966876 in all these months that ive followed him and listened to him i had never seen him so lively in such good form and especially and thats the novelty so aggressive
8966877 is a visionary and would certainly be a sort of fresh breeze on capitol hill
8966878 i think german people would vote in favor of him and hopefully america will do so
8966879 since hillary rodham clinton announced her support he has a true chance of winning the election
8966880 the prejudice in europe that americans are less interested in politics and the parties are not very different
8966881 this time the populace have really a choice the candidates represent different ideas and experiences
8966882 there is an enormous engagement and support for the candidates and europeans should try to learn from it
8966883 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8966884 they are hurling statements against each other but they both ultimately would serve to strengthen the u s military industrial complex and who knows whether osama is in a cave or a grave
8966885 perhaps the most daring vice presidential pick in recent american history

8966887 alaska gov sarah palin to meet with mccain vp search team
8966888 theres no reason in mccain waiting to see what the dems do first insofar as his picking palin as vp because no matter who obama picks palin is by far and i mean far the best pick for mccain and the gop especially in this time of gop woes
8966889 the triumph came in alaska where sarah palin a politician of eye popping integrity was elected governor
8966890 a rabbi a priest and a minister walk into a bar
8966891 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8966892 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8966893 who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8966894 no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8966895 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship
8966896 i want her to use the gifts she has in the best ways and to help others i said it from the very beginning show me who you walk with and i will tell you who you are people may deceive us but our eyes and facts dont open your eyes

8966901 uh what is gluten again and where can you find it
8966902 oh yeah lets get back to that aspect of my life
8966903 obviously its great to have rhys available for selection he is a born goalscorer and any team would love to have him in their squad
8966904 but you have to look at the lads who have played in his absence if someone is playing well enough to keep their place in the side then its difficult to replace them
8966905 its the way forward for welsh football we now have a 1 000 seater stadium and it will take time to bring fans in but summer football will bring in even more the pitches would be of a far better standard which will allow teams to play football and it would also help our teams in europe
8966906 i am pro life and i believe that marriage should only be between and man and a woman i am opposed to any expansion of gambling in alaska
8966907 its the same as it was two months ago when they did the first exam
8966908 now the thing is its not better either and it seems like the only way to repair it completely is arthroscopic surgery
8966909 it bodes well for him as a pragmatic and wise and experienced statesman
8966910 what hes doing here is hes calling an audible when conditions on the field are changing and thats what you do if you want to win the game here one of the pieces of a solution is allowing exploration on that little 2 000 acre plot of land out of the 20 million acres up there in the coastal plain
8966911 with new technology and directional drilling and other measures that can be taken today to minimize even that footprint we know that this can be done safely and this can be managed well
8966912 and i know up here in alaska most every alaskan believes that anwr should be drilled and no one cares more about alaskas environment our lands our wildlife our fresh air our clean water than alaskans themselves and we know that this can be allowed safely cleanly ethically this type of exploration and development of an american supply of energy
8966913 its been grossly misunderstood on many fronts when you see the pictures the visuals used in the opponents message and usually this is extreme environmentalists their message as to why anwr shouldnt be touched you see pictures of mountains and rivers and beautiful green valleys thats not anwr anwr is a flat barren plain that is very very rich in resources
8966914 perhaps the most daring vice presidential pick in recent american history
8966915 sarah barracuda miss congeniality fire and nice a happily married mother of five who is still drop dead gorgeous and smart to boot but its mostly because shes been a crackerjack governor a strong fiscal conservative and a ferocious fighter of corruption especially in her own party

8966920 the convention was drama the trial was comedy needless to say this is one unique film which unfortunately just falls short
8966921 our consumer research indicates that despite the smaller size there was no change in the perceived value of the product because of the benefits of the added features
8966922 guess what times are tough for you same thing for us heres a price increase were shrinking the package
8966923 i know that there are some people who think as sen mccain did he said you know some jobs are leaving michigan and theyre not coming back i disagree im going to fight for every single job michigan south carolina every state in this country were going to fight for jobs and make sure our future is bright

8966954 this proposed project offers timely and economic access for shippers to the u s gulf coast market
8966955 these options offer unparalleled flexibility to shippers and this project reflects our objective to provide our customers with the best transportation solutions available
8966956 this proposal is consistent with bps goals of maximizing value from existing assets and minimizing environmental impacts combined with the construction and operating experience of these two companies the proposed new delivery system will offer shippers the economics predictability and flexibility that are required in this high cost environment also timely redeployment of existing facilities significantly reduces the environmental impact associated with alternative proposed cross country pipelines
8966957 we have to teach the police officers that the taser is not an unoffensive weapon
8966958 i think that until we have serious studies on intoxicated or sick persons that are conclusive the taser should also be considered as a weapon that can lead to death
8966959 i think her selection would be something similar to dan quayle dan quayle proved to be sort of an embarrassment as a campaigner being thrust on a national stage like that could be very tough
8966960 now mondale tried to shake things up by going with geraldine ferraro she proved to be a disaster as a running mate and as a campaigner she was absolutely awful
8966961 and so i just think that it is very risky for mccain to do this but it may be all he has left
8966962 es un buen grupo a m me gustar a que pas semos tanto nosotros como el liverpool pero hay que luchar y trabajar tambi n est n olympique de marsella y psv que son dos grandes equipos hay que trabajar mucho est dif cil para todos pero vamos a intentarlo

8966978 anoles are highly visual species so in that sense its not surprising that they would use visual displays to mark territory
8966979 still the finding is surprising because these are the first animals known to use non acoustic signaling at dawn and dusk
8966980 these patterns have remarkable parallels with the dawn and dusk choruses reported for many acoustically communicating animals
8966981 the dawn chorus may be a way of communicating having survived the night

8967061 all of the states are frantically scrambling to acquire good quality data at the moment it has only been since the arctic ocean ice started to melt that they have been able to start taking proper surveys of the seabed so its a bit dangerous to speculate as to who is going to end up with what
8967062 legally it had no significance what so ever it provoked russias neighbors and there was a degree of geopolitical maneuvering but in legal terms it has absolutely no significance its not like land territory 100 years ago where the first nation to that point could claim sovereignty
8967063 any areas that end up being beyond the continental shelf fall under the jurisdiction of the international seabed authority
8967064 the area is described as a common heritage for mankind all states get a share of any revenue im not sure theyve worked out all the mechanisms for distributing it but thats the principle
8967065 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8967066 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
8967067 you think about everything from campaign finance to immigration and on and theres john mccain working across party lines senator obama doesnt have a record now he can make the claim and he can hold himself up as pure and trying to reach to a new generation of post partisan politics but he has to do so largely based on rhetoric and wishful thinking because he doesnt have the record
8967068 there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically
8967069 obama might have a similar bottom line core principles for which in some sense he is willing to die if so we dont know what they are nothing so far in his life approaches mccains decision to refuse repatriation as a pow so as to deny his jailors a propaganda coup in fact there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically thats why his reversal on campaign financing and his transparently false justification of it matter more than similar acts by mccain
8967070 hes pretty much a conventional liberal on the issues and has few examples of breaking with his own party so how does obama try to pull off being post partisan
8967071 his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8967072 boren the lone democrat in oklahomas congressional delegate said that while obama has talked about working with republicans unfortunately his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8967073 the record shows obama to be a fairly doctrinaire liberal democrat
8967074 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8967075 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8967076 for a couple of days theyve been saying you voted to raise taxes something like 94 times that seems to be the drumbeat thats going to happen during this campaign are you going to raise taxes in a big way for average americans
8967077 i mean this is the standard fare of politics and the truth of the matter is that the only bills that i voted for for the most part since ive been in the senate were introduced by republicans with george bush you know they were the majority for a big chunk of the time i was there
8967078 finally the obama people are too convinced that they can define mccain as bush iii the case is just factually inaccurate mccain will be able to pull out dozens of instances from torture to global warming to spending in which he broke with his party as rush limbaugh will tell you
8967079 as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq
8967080 in early november 2003 at a time when fred dalton thompson was playing a tough d a on law and order john mccain was cross examining donald rumsfeld for real on capitol hill it was still very early into the u s occupation of iraq but the as yet unacknowledged by rummy that is insurgency was already out of control alone among his fellow gop senators mccain blasted rumsfeld for not putting enough u s troops on the ground and for resorting too soon to iraqification that is transferring security to ill prepared iraqi forces in an extraordinarily blunt speech at the council on foreign relations that grim autumn mccain warned that ultimately iraq could become another vietnam if we lose popular support in the united states the next day the secretary of defense asked mccain to breakfast i read y our speech harrumphed rumsfeld that must have been an enjoyable experience for him mccain later joked to me then rummy patiently explained to his fellow republican why he and his top civilian brass paul wolfowitz doug feith and the usual crowd of incompetents would continue to do things the same way they believed there was no need for additional troops mccain later related mccain had already realized that rumsfeld was a lost cause the real question the senator suggested to me back then was whether george w bush himself would push rummy to make changes id like to see the president fully engaged mccain said bush needed to be on top of more details of whats going on as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq right down to the need for bush to get engaged and fire rumsfeld mccain was so right that among military experts today the emerging conventional wisdom about bushs current surg e is that if it had occurred back then when mccain wanted it and the political will existed in this country to support it for the necessary number of years it might well have succeeded
8967081 widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush
8967082 on global warming mccain is widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush immediately after the 2004 election in which he stumped for bushs re election he sharply distanced himself from bush on climate change calling the administrations stance terribly disappointing mccain had co sponsored a bill with sen joe lieberman to curb greenhouse gases in 2003 bush had opposed any such move citing possible harm to the economy and doubts over global warming
8967083 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president he said that the fundamentals of the e conomy are strong
8967084 the second and third quotes the obama campaign uses from mccain are more misleading the ad shows mccain saying t heres been great progress economically the quote comes from an interview mccain did with peter cook at bloomberg television in april mccain was making a case for what he believed were positive economic developments during bushs time in office however the fuller quote shows mccain was saying that whatever progress had been made it wouldnt be enough to comfort families facing these tremendous economic challenges his comments overall are pessimistic he cites challenging times and enormous difficulties the obama campaign distorts his views by using just a snippet of his remarks
8967085 im going to ask you a version of the ronald reagan question you think if americans were asked are you better off today than you were before george bush took office more than seven years ago what answer would they give
8967086 certainly in this time we are in very challenging times
8967087 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera yo u could make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time but thats no comfort thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges but let me just add peter the fundamentals of americas economy are strong were the greatest exporter the greatest importer the greatest innovator the greatest producer still the greatest economic engine in the world and by the way exports and free trade are a key element in economic recovery but these are tough times tough times and nobody knows that more than american families including in small towns of pennsylvania they havent lost their fundamental religious beliefs their respect for the constitution their right to bear arms they are still keep america as a beacon of hope and freedom throughout the world
8967088 he knows how to twist with the best of them
8967089 although obama gets substantial mileage out of running against politics as usual he provided a reminder on friday that he knows how to twist with the best of them
8967090 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
8967091 i do not make a promise that we can reduce the budget deficit by 2013
8967092 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
8967093 since winning the nomination obama reportedly has been moving toward the middle of the political spectrum but on the budget he still sounds left of center with no interest in eliminating deficit spending
8967094 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
8967095 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
8967096 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
8967097 has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of
8967098 the obama campaign responds that tax cuts once enacted are usually renewed and do not expire therefore they say obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do
8967099 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
8967100 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8967101 the latest additions to sen barack obamas energy plan outlined during an appearance in lansing monday may win the democratic presidential candidate some votes from disgruntled consumers in november but theyll do nothing to answer the nations long term needs
8967102 when his presumptive republican opponent sen john mccain r ariz proposed a gas tax holiday as a way to reduce the high cost of driving mr obama showed political courage and intellectual honesty by refusing to sign on to that obvious gimmick its an idea to get them through an election mr obama said now he has two such gimmicks of his own
8967103 the politics may have changed but the facts havent the accuracy of sen mccains original position has not changed offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices next year and it would not lower gas prices five years from now
8967104 i think john mccains proposal for a three month tax holiday is a bad idea
8967105 in this campaign john mccain is offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices gimmicks that will only increase our addiction for another four years
8967106 that might make sense in washington but it doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than guess where right here in nevada at yucca mountain
8967107 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
8967108 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
8967109 but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help if oil prices fall there might be no windfall profits to tax then the obama rebate would have to be paid for through spending cuts taxes on something else or borrowing
8967110 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8967111 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standar d deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
8967112 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
8967113 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
8967114 vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year
8967115 factcheck org a nonpartisan web site said the vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year the 32 000 figure it said was the amount of taxable income those people had

8967150 non ha importanza chiunque vuol venire fa sicuramente un buon affare la cosa importante che il management la scelta delle rotte la posizione e la distribuzione di velivoli e qual modo di fare tipicamente italiano sia quello che caratterizza la compagnia di bandiera poi se vogliono venire ben vengano a dare i capitali che ci aiuteranno a svilupparla ulteriormente ma quello che mi pare che questo governo riuscito a realizzare una cosa estremamente positiva perch vedere sedici grandi imprenditori di formazione diversa con interessi diversi mettersi insieme per rilanciare con forza il vettore nazionale mi sembra un fatto assolutamente straordinario e positivo che noi tutti dovremmo salutare con grande favore

8967189 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8967190 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8967191 what the people heard people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8967192 im crying because i was around when martin luther king died and when john f kennedy died and its a long time since then and a long time to get back the dream
8967193 this is history i will tell my grandchildren about this
8967194 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have

8967196 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8967197 i worked on the hillary clinton campaign for a year and ive come to the realization that hes the one to change this country
8967198 but lets hope that americans are going to address the problems that are bedeviling the country
8967199 how long can obamas campaign run on hate of bush most voters dont harbor and nurture that hate

8967204 en muchos casos el trabajador prefiere que le paguen en negro o no hace horas extras para que no se lleve ese esfuerzo este impuesto

8967224 it wasnt a great start we were outplayed there are reasons why we couldnt put out our full team three or four were with the first team and weve got a few injuries
8967225 to play them with six or seven players missing was too much that was just one game though and weve got another 27 to play in the league
8967226 its been an exciting time for everyone at the academy with the number of boys in and around the first team
8967227 we thought that jack rodwell would play a part but maybe not such an integral part we thought one or two of the younger players might be on the bench and get a little bit of a taste with now having seven substitutes
8967228 but we never thought that jose would make a debut so early on

8967231 for the european market we will release it as soon as possible after japan we are planning it for the u s but the launch timing is not decided
8967232 the market this past quarter really suffered for precisely that reason
8967233 even since the first quarter of 2008 its been one of the markets where we flagged it with a warning that it was getting a bit unstable
8967234 a number of the key markets like china india and korea and so forth are all getting hit a bit

8967244 people are angry because the path to two high schools has changed so many times
8967245 theres a simple answer to all of this let the community decide with a vote
8967246 going to the community to poll it every time a decision needs to be made is not leadership

8967251 we dont want to get into a situation where people cant afford to live here because our taxes are too high
8967252 its about becoming informed taking a stand and implementing that stand
8967253 you know how i operate i get as committed as i can
8967254 the opportunities this school system gives to families is phenomenal
8967255 as for that vp talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration we want to make sure that that vp slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up here for the rest of the u s before i can even start addressing that question

8967260 com a ren ncia do presidente georgiano shevardnadze a oposi o radical pr eua chegou ao poder em tbilisi
8967261 estes eventos sem sombra de d vida pavimentar o o caminho para um grande conflito e para a desintegra o da ge rgia
8967262 nina burdzhanadze foi a primeira a fazer uma declara o televisionada logo ap s a ren ncia do presidente disse conseguimos superar a mais grave crise da hist ria recente da ge rgia sem derramar uma nica gota de sangue mas ela falou cedo demais as intrigas dos imperialistas causar o muito derramamento de sangue antes que a crise se resolva de uma maneira ou de outra os novos l deres j lan am nervosos olhares em dire o r ssia declarando o final da campanha de desobedi ncia disse que o pa s deve trabalhar para fortalecer seus la os com seus vizinhos e com o grande estado da r ssia mas belas palavras n o impressionar o ao kremlin a r ssia est acompanhando de perto a pol tica e a conduta do novo governo em tbilisi e se preparando para apertar o cerco o resultado ser novas guerras caos e horror sem fim
8967263 washington e moscou consideram os pequenos fracos e divididos estados caucasianos como meros pe es em um jogo onde toda a regi o serve como um gigantesco tabuleiro a am rica faz um movimento a r ssia responde e o resultado uma guerra um massacre uma explos o um golpe militar ou uma revolu o incruenta aguardamos o pr ximo movimento no tabuleiro n o sabemos nem quando nem onde moscou responder mas de uma coisa temos certeza os perdedores ser o as pessoas comuns os pobres aqueles que n o podem se defender
8967264 os russos mudaram drasticamente acompanhando o balan o de poder na regi o deram boas vindas oportunidade de mostrar em casa a nova realidade eles poderiam invadir a ge rgia e os estados unidos e a europa n o poderiam fazer nada n o viram risco na invas o militarmente n o h resist ncia economicamente a r ssia exportadora de energia e o tem feito muito bem de fato os europeus precisam mais da energia russa do que os russos necessitam vend la politicamente como veremos os americanos precisam dos russos mais do que os russos precisam dos americanos os c lculos de moscou disseram que esse era o momento de atacar os russos estavam se preparando para isso h meses e atacaram
8967265 os russos sabiam que os estados unidos repudiariam seu ataque mas hoje a r ssia tem mais autonomia os protestos ruidosos destes dirigentes contrastam com sua inatividade e os russos querem disseminar em casa a id ia de que as garantias americanas n o passam de palavras vazias
8967266 eles n o s o a principal pot ncia n o passam de uma ar bia saudita com rvores
8967267 a r ssia czarista era uma pris o para as nacionalidades
8967268 l nin defendia a unidade dos povos do antigo imp rio czarista mas tinha que ser uma unidade volunt ria por isso insistiu desde o in cio na quest o sobre o direito autodetermina o esta id ia freq entemente mal compreendida como uma exig ncia a separa o mas isto completamente incorreto os bolcheviques n o eram a favor da separa o mas defendiam a extens o mais ampla poss vel do direito autodetermina o at mesmo e inclusive a separa o ningu m tem o direito de obrigar um povo a viver dentro dos confins de um estado quando a maioria n o o deseja mas o direito autodetermina o n o implica a reivindica o da separa o da mesma forma que o direito ao div rcio n o significa que todos os casais tenham que se separar ou que o direito ao aborto signifique que se tem que por fim a todas as gravidezes
8967269 o direito autodetermina o era uma parte importante do programa de l nin na medida em que demonstrava claramente aos trabalhadores e camponeses especialmente a estes oprimidos da pol nia ge rgia let nia e ucr nia que os trabalhadores russos n o tinham nenhum interesse em oprimi los e que defenderiam firmemente seu direito de decidir seu pr prio destino mas isto era apenas a metade do programa de l nin sobre a quest o nacional a outra metade igualmente importante a necessidade de manter a uni o do proletariado acima de todas as diferen as nacionais ling sticas ou religiosa no que se refere ao partido bolchevique l nin sempre se op s a qualquer tend ncia de dividir o partido e o movimento oper rio em geral sob linhas nacionais
8967270 depois da revolu o l nin pensava que poderia haver uma uni o fraterna e volunt ria dos povos do antigo regime czarista na forma de uma federa o sovi tica

8967274 they wouldnt be able to be in business if they did that
8967275 we are working with the supplier and cpsc and are directing store managers to remove product identified in the cpsc press release from store shelves and initiating a register block to prevent sale

8967277 they say having kids at my age either makes you or breaks you and im leaning heavily toward break right now
8967278 its been a long time since we had a rate increase like this
8967279 if you take that 20 percent hike and just calculate it against what we spent last year youll find out that equates to over 500 000

8967288 si tratta di un bluff che non fa gli interessi degli italiani
8967289 e unoperazione che scarica sui cittadini debiti e costi si costruisce con procedure ad hoc facendo venir meno le regole dellantitrust e rischiando di aprire un contenzioso a livello europeo una societ sulla quale imprenditori privati avranno la possibilit di fare degli utili
8967290 ma anche da questo punto di vista c la possibilit che nel corso degli anni chi intervenuto e ha realizzato interessi possa rivendere a quel socio straniero che oggi interviene con una quota azionaria inferiore
8967291 non c quellipotesi di rilancio di malpensa cos come alcune forze del centrodestra chiedevano e questo determiner problemi
8967292 non c dubbio che in quelloccasione ci fu da parte dei sindacati un giudizio non positivo rispetto alla trattativa e questo fren loperazione che tuttavia nelle ultime settimane si stava concretizzando anche con lappoggio delle rappresentanze dei lavoratori poi il caso alitalia divenne uno degli argomenti fondamentali della campagna elettorale e berlusconi da vincitore subito annunci che con air france non si sarebbe fatto nulla temo che adesso per i sindacati la situazione sar pi complicata
8967293 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
8967294 imam moussa al sadr was a major turning point for shiites in lebanon he moved them from isolation and marginalization to uprising
8967295 all shiite resistance groups and movements were triggered by imam slogans
8967296 i will not rest until there is no deprived person or a deprived area in lebanon
8967297 it is clear to the family and the law it is a case of kidnapping and until there is proof otherwise this stance remains the same

8967306 malt costs have risen 60 in the last year and hops prices are five times higher for us that means a 1 5 million increase in the costs of goods its tough but were focused on controlling other costs so that whatever else may be affected the quality of our product wont be
8967307 craft brewers are lucky because our typical customers are much more concerned with flavor than price
8967308 they want an experience of taste and variety and they dont mind spending a little more to get it
8967309 were growing in new places but also in long time markets
8967310 thats a testament to the strength of our brand and its increasing popularity in an industry that is itself doing very well
8967311 and with both oil and gasoline inventories much lower than when katrina and rita hit the price consequences could be even worse this time any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 1 75 per litre
8967312 whether gustav ultimately lives up to its hurricane billings and sidelines production like rita and katrina remains to be seen but its very presence in the rig dotted region underscores the vulnerability of u s domestic crude supply to climate change
8967313 just as america has come to rely more and more on gulf production to offset steadily declining production from alaska and the lower 48 states the frequency of high grade storms class 3 to 5 hurricanes in the region has nearly doubled in recent years americas one and only source of production growth could be shut down again and the price impacts would be severe
8967314 es una opci n bastante interesante para la parte peruana
8967315 una opci n puede ser que algunos productos agr colas sensibles vayan a 17 a os la otra que no se retire todo el arancel sino la mitad y que la otra mitad se desgrave en 10 a os estamos estudiando esas distintas modalidades

8967320 this transaction is consistent with iamgolds strategy of rationalizing our structure and significantly reducing cash costs at all of our operations
8967321 we continue to demonstrate our focus on operational efficiencies and costs at our operations with the long term objective of reducing our cash costs below the industry average
8967322 it reduces their cost base and that is one of the key industry issues that the companies are facing right now the crippling high costs
8967323 anything that can be done internally such as this buying back a royalty is very material for iamgold
8967324 until the board of directors has completed its review it will not comment further or speculate as to the future course of action it might take

8967343 the republicans just yanked the rug out from under obama
8967344 the drinking age is not the problem it is the lack of responsible parenting
8967345 it cant be 18 because drinking should never be legal for a high school student
8967346 lets lower the age make it less taboo and start educating our children on the responsible use of alcohol
8967347 if they can go to iraq and be shot at plus vote for the commander in chief that sent them there they can sure have a beer

8967395 our first venture with gamecock dementium was an ideal partnership for us
8967396 our new game has been a pet project of ours for a while now and it not only felt natural but necessary that we team up with gamecock again were really looking forward to working with these talented folks again
8967397 the exciting thing about working with renegade kid and what we learned the first time around is that theyll stick to their guns and put everything they have into it

8967403 the job i do now i think is important and what i really want to do is make a difference

8967427 in 2005 the shanghai group took an unexpectedly sharp position against the united states its members called for a time table for american forces to vacate central asian bases that the pentagon has used for operations in nearby afghanistan
8967428 and it seems vladimir putin and dmitry medvedev were expecting the sco to back them over the georgia issue in that spirit but china basically told them to take a hike staying decided neutral on the issue
8967429 china had expressed its understanding of russias decision to recognize georgias breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia
8967430 the leaders of the shanghai cooperation organization member states welcome the signing in moscow of the six principles for regulating the south ossetia conflict and support russias active role in assisting peace and cooperation in the region

8967433 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character

8967435 it is fantastic to be able to bring this historic flag back to london after 60 years but the great story of our journey towards london 2012 really begins when i return from beijing next month with the paralympic flag and both are raised outside city hall to remind the world that in less than four years we will stage an olympic and paralympic games theyll never forget

8967445 israelis are the most creative and passionate people in the world that combination makes them interesting and attractive
8967446 strong forces are trying to maintain israel in the arena of the conflict as long as we remain in this arena we will not be able to change israels image
8967447 it will not solve all the problems but at least it will give people a more complete perspective of who we are
8967448 you can call is marketing you can call it advertising but at the end of the day there is something good about us that people dont know
8967449 it will be a success even if one person will say i didnt know that israelis invented that
8967450 the israeli establishment was to preoccupied with itself with its security and internal problems it took israel some time to develop and grow up in the sense of understanding that our image is not less important than our military might
8967451 when israel took the lead on that issue i believe it was much easier for the jewish community the pro israel community and for individuals to become a part of this process
8967452 because of the special nature of toronto as a multicultural community lessons that are being learned here are applicable in most of the united states cities and also in europe
8967453 jewish communities all over the world usually do not enjoy such a level of self confidence
8967454 i would like to see more attempts to reach out to other countries in the case of israel and to other communities in the case of the jewish community in toronto
8967455 my son jeff was by my side from the very beginning
8967456 i come in for meetings and to help with certain things but jeff runs the place now
8967457 we moved here in 1978 after running the business from home for four years
8967458 we only do deliveries that can be done next day
8967459 boston is about as far north as our drivers go as a general rule
8967460 the main thing that helps us is our use of holtzman oil corporation
8967461 we also fuel here at our shop instead of elsewhere
8967462 we have them set for 68 miles per hour which keeps costs down
8967463 every mile over 55 that a driver speeds is one tenth less per gallon we are getting
8967464 to put it in perspective every half mile more a gallon we get saves about 180 a week per truck
8967465 in 1994 we put satellite systems in all our trucks that tell us exactly where they are at all times
8967466 drivers will be able to turn off the truck and the cabin will stay cool in the summer or warm in the winter
8967467 the trailer will also maintain temperature and the engine will stay warm
8967468 theres always been a bunch of womens boutiques around here but theres a void when it comes to specialty mens stores
8967469 we have backgrounds in retail as managers and buyers this is something weve both always been into
8967470 everything is hanging or folded like it would be in your own closet
8967471 we want to be a premium upscale retailer moving away from what youd traditionally think of as urban clothing
8967472 were working with rock and hip hop inspired clothes with some similar brands and styles to what youd see in a neiman marcus or a bloomingdales
8967473 most of our stuff is limited we dont hold a heavy amount of inventory
8967474 we try to keep limited amounts of styles to stay fresh and on top of whats new

8967482 i am one of three generations my son and grandson are in the department as well
8967483 of course i dont go out to fires anymore but i help out as much as i can
8967484 my grandson zachary has also been working with me for the past three years
8967485 we color code the tops according to the standards set by the nfpa the national fire protection agency
8967486 the flow depends on the size of the water line that is connected to the hydrant
8967487 four inch lines are under the red coded hydrants but there arent many of those size left in town
8967488 if a large building has a high flow hydrant in front this is very good for their insurance rate because they would be able to put out a fire more efficiently
8967489 another way to increase water flow is with the aid of the fire truck
8967490 i was in charge of the restoration of the old 1942 fire truck
8967491 it was very challenging and still has some work left but i enjoyed doing it
8967492 since homewood is affiliated with the united church of christ are there any tax implications
8967493 were sponsored by the church of christ not owned by the church of christ
8967494 in maryland and virginia assisted living and nursing are tax exempt independent living is not tax exempt
8967495 that means lots of vehicles does homewood pay personal property taxes
8967496 it seems to me homewood wont impact the public schools that should be enough to explain the change in contribution
8967497 the calls would primarily be alarms civil questions and scams that target elderly
8967498 we initiated that study with patton harris rust and associates in harrisonburg
8967499 theyre determining where were at how much the line is capable of handling
8967500 we expect the report to be done very soon well see what that report says and from there what the line is capable of handling we feel with the phasing proffered and the timing of when we would start rehabbing the line that time should work out fine
8967501 all the girls had roles in that run and just had their own touch they added to it
8967502 this group coming in this year are going to be abl to step in and fill those spots but its going to take some time to get to the level we left off on
8967503 im using two setters this year and theyre both very athletic
8967504 so its like having two kaitlyns on the floor which is a nice thing
8967505 it makes the floor easier to run rather than just having one setter
8967506 coming off the bench any of those sophomores will be working hard
8967507 theyre going to have to really learn a lot in a short amount of time and mature
8967508 theyre attacking well blocking well and hopefully it just continues to get stronger as the season progresses
8967509 teams are going to be gunning for us because we beat them and we beat them in three games
8967510 thats only going to make us stronger as a young group
8967511 we havent really talked about goals yet either because i know they did come off a disappointing season last year
8967512 they are able to tell us what they were doing last year so we can make adjustments but all of them are leaders on the court which ive never seen before
8967513 i think all the kids up from jv fit in nicely with the kids who were on varsity last year
8967514 i tell the kids every practice that we dont have a starting six
8967515 they all made the team because they all add something to the team
8967516 the passing is too close to the net right now
8967517 it needs to be off of the net for a good set and hit we dont want to help the other team
8967518 john mccain brings something to the white house barack obama gave a good speach in 2002
8967519 but an audience of 70 000 to 80 000 adoring supporters is not looking for 12 point policy proposals they want emotion and motivation and that they will get
8967520 i dont know if there are others out there but now that his name is out there for this they may come forward
8967521 i was embarrassed i didnt want to tell anybody i didnt want to have to be here doing this now talking about it
8967522 so you are testifying that you know what your sister said but you didnt tell your sister your mother or the investigator
8967523 breaking off diplomatic relations with tbilisi is not moscows choice and the responsibility lies with tbilisi
8967524 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
8967525 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8967526 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
8967527 we dont foresee any sanctions decided on by the european council
8967528 this taxi a classic london icon carries a personal message from me that we want chinese businesses looking to expand overseas to call us in london first to see what magnificent opportunities our capital offers both as a great place to operate and access western markets as well as a great place for overseas staff to live
8967529 by the time the olympic flame is re ignited in london in 2012 we want to have brought 30 new chinese companies to the capital there is a tremendous history of cooperation between the uk and china and london represents a wealth of opportunity for chinese companies growth in london is forecast at 80bn over the next four years with the olympics contributing 8bn the london taxi donated by lti slti and geely represents the way london and china can work together and we are delighted that this symbol of business partnership and of london will be visiting so many chinese cities
8967530 since its inception our company strives to be a truly international enterprise investing in europe is an important step to achieve this vision in the 2009 fiscal year we will strengthen our momentum in internationalization and will expand our presence in london and canada

8967720 i hope that the next few years will be years of dramatic education improvement and focus in indiana
8967721 we have to help young people understand that they are unlikely to hold a family supporting job in this world without some education beyond high school we have to make that dream a very real one in households where now it is not

8967724 this center becomes very very important not just for toyota but for economic development in southwest indiana and the state as a whole hopefully this will be a benchmark for other regions within the state to follow in the future

8967735 the mccain campaign their response seemed to be that they might has well have been speechless they didnt know how to react to this speech they could have written that response before the speech even started they dont know how to react to this speech maybe they were focus grouping at the time and it focus grouped very well whatever the response was they dont know how to react to this just yet one more point the 2 conventions normally you want to go second but this is the first time we had back to back conventions like this and i tell ya i dont know if the republican party really is looking forward to having to follow this show because as a political show this is gonna be hard to top not just next week but four of eight years from now
8967736 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8967737 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president

8967778 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
8967779 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8967780 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
8967781 we dont foresee any sanctions decided on by the european council
8967782 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia
8967783 we did have lots of contacts with georgia over a long period of time
8967784 georgia found it too hard to hold that line when they were seeing what russia was preparing to do

8967786 the turkish military takes its side in the secularism discussion
8967787 ethnic diversity has become a threat against national unity and security as a result of transnational social and cultural movements international associations and transnational civil society organizations started to become more efficient in taking and applying global decisions
8967788 the nation state which is considered as the greatest obstacle in front of globalization is trying to be removed through economic control micro ethnic provocations redefining the regimes and organizations of countries colorful revolts injected in countries and titles which are tried to be added in front of country names
8967789 new opportunities in communication and media are used against the nation state while traditional values morality and justice concepts which keep the nations afloat are trying to be worn off
8967790 separatist moves lead to impositions although threats and risks gained an economic as well as sociocultural aspect rather than a military one they are far more dangerous and destructive than military threats
8967791 they can be concealed with efficiency under a veil of modern values like democracy and human rights nation states are condemned to disintegration and division in the name of democracy and human rights
8967792 but at the macro level turkey has failed to draw the direction between the western bloc and russia for 10 years
8967793 turkey has fallen behind in the caucasus with the policies it has so far pursued
8967794 but turkey should very well know about the expectations of the parties concerned
8967795 there is no nato naval build up in the black sea as russian authorities are claiming in the media
8967796 the treaty is implemented letter by letter it is as simple as this
8967797 south ossetia abkhazia and cyprus are separate issues will the russian decision have an impact on cyprus i believe it could have but i cannot predict in which direction
8967798 this makes the cyprus problem a more just and legitimate cause for the turkish cypriots
8967799 stay no longer than one additional month to complete her duties
8967800 ready to share our experiences in education science and technology with turkey
8967801 you need to have your financial controls in the public sector in place first
8967802 we want to make sure that there is a system in place that will safeguard these funds that they are used for the right purposes and that the programs can be successful
8967803 the new law focuses on internal audits and the role of the internal audit is to check to see if the controls in place are good controls too many controls can be redundant
8967804 an internal audit will increase the efficiency of the public sector and ultimately thats to the benefit of the turkish economy the benefit of every taxpayer in turkey
8967805 i believe we need to change the culture in the public sector as well moving from a purely bureaucratic lets say monster towards sometimes small departments highly effective rapid responses towards the community
8967806 that will take a while and for that we cannot only focus on internal audits we have to educate all the people in the public sector so they all move in the same direction and see the advantage of it
8967807 turkey might be the first country where a nuclear power plant will be built without necessary scientific and engineering personnel i do not think there are countries with nuclear power plants without a firm grip on nuclear technology
8967808 turkish firms are not capable of anything but laying the groundwork of the plant site turkey is simply not ready
8967809 well open the envelopes at 14 30 on sept 24 we are not looking positively at the request for an extension companies should work harder to catch up with the time
8967810 due to the governments decision not to extend the period for preparing offers we are reconsidering our decision on whether we will participate in the nuclear power plant tender
8967811 we are assessing the decision of the government with our partners spanish iberdrola and ge hitachi and eventually we will make a decision
8967812 we object to the official attitude which do not clarify the issues of licensing and insurance in the tender specification so the rejected request for additional time demand is not the only problem
8967813 if consortiums are adequate the time they had should have been enough the time limit itself acted as a qualifying criteria
8967814 companies may demand prolongation but the tender commission of turkey electricity trade a teta saw no reason for it
8967815 in the united states a nuclear waste dump is being built under yucca mountain in nevada and republicans and democrats rallied to fight against the project that will dump as much as 135 000 tons of nuclear waste in the region even the united states did not solve its waste problems while turkey starts its nuclear plant construction willy nilly without considering the consequences
8967816 turkey is entering this sector with a four and a half page law which cannot be considered a viable beginning there is no way turkey can transfer technology and reduce foreign dependence that way
8967817 turkey will be dependent on nuclear technology on treatment of wastes and uranium enrichment the treasury will bear the burden of the nuclear waste produced without any discernable benefit
8967818 television is a mirror of society and italian society tells women that you have to look sexy and young all the time
8967819 we cant get out of the stereotype of the superbabe or the foxy mama
8967820 it privileges easy success through shortcuts and without daily effort
8967821 whoever wants to become a television journalist is subjected to far worse humiliation than the girls competing to become veline
8967822 just like christopher columbus who didnt invent america but discovered it all ive done is make veline visible theyve always existed
8967823 italians dont think theres anything wrong with having a good looking half naked woman next to a male presenter giving the news
8967824 italians dont like guns and blood and they prefer their women less guns and blood more half naked women thats our bread and butter
8967825 the proposal is based on the targeted inflation rate and this situation disturbed us the targeted inflation rate however couldnt be realized for the last three years
8967826 we want the wage increases not to be based on the targeted inflation figures we will consider the governments proposal and meet again in the afternoon
8967827 the government announced its 2009 budget for the wage increases as ytl 5 75 billion on monday and the figure was raised today to ytl 5 81 billion with an increase of ytl 51 million this figure is far from meeting our demands
8967828 these attacks can hurt us but cannot shake the peoples confidence towards the military
8967829 with its democratic and secular structure our country should fight against those challenges
8967830 its a fact that there are those who want to destroy our secular structure
8967831 we aim to solve the cyprus problem within 2008 we think that a solution is possible in this short time frame we will be at the table with all our goodwill
8967832 also tourists they send have extra spending money and help hotel owners to recover the season at a time when prices have fallen due to stiff competition in the sector
8967833 middle eastern tourists like urban life thats why they prefer to stay in hotels situated in the center of the town they can find both urban life and all characteristics of a holiday resort
8967834 turkish tv series which have been shown on these countries televisions in recent years draw millions of viewers many things are a part of normal life in our country but forbidden in these countries making turkey an attractive place for them they find turkish people close to themselves and see turkey as a window opening to europe we expect that more middle eastern tourists will choose turkey in the next years
8967835 some say i am a boor i am an innocent and good person i pay my taxes
8967836 my friends helped me hold the party i am not a rich man if i had so much money i wouldnt have spent it that way
8967837 what is planned is a smaller version of the bsec my question is how would it provide any other value
8967838 russia does not believe in these organizations it sees the black sea as a russian sea and the caucasus as russian territory it does not want cooperation
8967839 in a way it is a move that would legitimize russias use of power to change borders in the region turkey is not aware of this instead of condemning russia turkey says let us create an organization and sit down and talk
8967840 the timing is bad the caucasus is not ready for such a platform yet this would not help to solve the conflicts but it would lead to deadlock
8967841 the bsec does not deal with hard security issues turkey and russia are cautious about augmenting the scope of security involvement
8967842 the bsec has a lot to offer in the medium and long terms irrespective of political differences it is the only organization bringing armenia and turkey or georgia and russia together diplomats try to work together despite political problems
8967843 the bsec lays the groundwork opens channels of communication and provides infrastructure it cannot deal with cease fire it is not the bsecs duty to have a comment or to take sides in a conflict
8967844 i do not see a reason for such an initiative russians are not after stability georgias territorial integrity is under question americans are making counter statements azerbaijan does not support it even if it cannot oppose it directly
8967845 the bsec is a totally different organization turkey and russia do not want it to be involved in politics or security moreover russia would not want a multilateral platforms interference
8967846 there is polarization on the black sea after recent developments it got deeper it became sharp contrasts in fact i do not see the bsecs future very bright either no statement came from the bsec after the conflict and it is not in a position to do so
8967847 i tried 10 pages and said i can do this
8967848 our actors have just graduated from conservatory so they are young they are fresh and they are excited
8967849 chairs tables i dont want them i want only the magic of the theater
8967850 you have to take time now to stop and think about what you value i think this is the most important point of the play
8967851 i have no idea i think thats why im working on this play
8967852 its very likely that we shall make it here and that is our wish i have a great faith in everybody
8967853 i couldnt put it all together i couldnt get money i couldnt get actors eventually i said its not going to work im gonna write a book
8967854 this is not a war movie its in the theatre of war but its about people
8967855 if you had fun in sarajevo its hard to explain that to someone and then also tell how bad it is because they think well its fun well no its in the context of insanity
8967856 after this war i got a little crazy i couldnt find my way back
8967857 they always ask where they can find it tekirda is very important to them they count themselves as half hadji when they visit the places where rakoczi lived
8967858 since the area is dried we will talk to the mayor and ask for his help to bring this healing mud to light and to use it as a tourist product
8967859 tekirda s tourism potential is not only limited to sea and sand it should be diversified in the fields of health culture and congress tourism we will introduce yarapsan mud which is in high demand with hungarian tourists to the world
8967860 turkey is extremely significant for us in the past five years turkey and iraq went through difficult times but when we overcome the problem of security our relationship will be better
8967861 for gas we have very high technical criteria and turkey needs to provide that technical criteria for electricity the iraqi government is privatizing the sector our doors are open to turkey
8967862 iraqs security is getting better day by day and as it keeps improving the economy will improve as well
8967863 we would like to have business relations not only with northern iraq but with the other parts of the country
8967864 our national football teams will encounter each other for the first time in our history this could be a good chance to develop our relations the result is not important i hope it will be a good event which will please the audience excitement will be high through the participation of the armenian and turkish presidents it will be a fantastic event we are neighbors and we will continue being neighbours i think it is more beneficial for both countries to be in usual relations i made my proposal to mr g l in this framework
8967865 i think they will not go beyond acceptable behaviour to make their voice heard i consider uncivilized behaviours towards g l as a discourtesy against armenia and me because the one who invited mr g l is me
8967866 we are ready to establish diplomatic relations with turkey without any precondition
8967867 i also heard concerns about east west armenia from turkish officials it is weird to me because these are geographical terms used in the 19th century persistence in forgetting and erasing the statement which stayed in the past resembles denying the past existence of many geographical terms including sparta the russian dynasty and the ottoman empire if it were our official policy our name would not be republic of armenia but republic of east armenia
8967868 when we get the offer we will study the details and reveal our attitude
8967869 many people hold mistaken beliefs about what causes cancer tending to inflate the threat from environmental factors that have relatively little impact while minimizing the hazards of behavior
8967870 the scientific evidence for the protective effect of fruit and vegetables is weaker than the evidence that alcohol intake is harmful
8967871 such a misbelief is worrying because it might deter people from participating in cancer screening programs which are important for saving lives
8967872 in general people in all countries are more ready to accept that things outside of their control might cause cancer such as air pollution than things that are within their control
8967873 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change
8967874 the time is right to make cancer control a development priority
8967875 developing countries are now face to face with problems that affluent countries confronted decades ago but with the shift in the cancer burden a nations resource level can no longer be viewed as a barrier to cancer control

8967884 we decided to move to this area as it more accessible for the public
8967885 most sushi restaurants offer chinese noodles or thai dishes on their menu we do not
8967886 recent activity levels in the housing market have been very subdued
8967887 overall confidence in economic and housing market conditions is low
8967888 the overwhelming story is that the export numbers have offset this domestic weakness in consumer spending and business investment
8967889 declining home prices and job losses are still hanging over consumer spending and that is not likely to change in the near term
8967890 a special committee has been formed within the central bank to prepare the currency reform and the suppression of several zeroes
8967891 a 10 000 rial note has the same purchasing power now as 25 rials 30 years ago
8967892 people adore this blog for its snarky insightful commentary and reporting
8967893 askkids com was built with this in mind and organizes search results in a graphically vivid three panel display that includes smart answers and related images current events videos and encyclopedia results
8967894 tell them johnny wadd is here is the only one staying true to the whole story with detective busts and things like that
8967895 the dvds are available to buy on our website but were looking for distribution and to get them into stores
8967896 these debates related to the forward sale and purchase of stocks are details the actual thing to be considered is the new investment instrument warrant investors will have high interest in this market
8967897 real interest rates which declined parallel to inflation reduced the interest toward domestic government bonds which had a significant presence in our countrys financial markets not long ago rapidly increasing foreign investor attention also has increased the demand for new financial tools
8967898 during periods when volatility is high in stock markets while interest rates remain low in money and capital markets financial instruments such as warrants that protect investments against volatilities start to surface
8967899 institutions operating in these markets of other countries are positive that the product will receive intense demand also in turkey
8967900 the lawyers are proving how organized they are that they have total consensus and this protest will continue until the chief justice is restored
8967901 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8967902 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8967903 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8967904 the mahdi army suspension will be valid indefinitely and anyone who does not follow this order will not be considered a member of this group
8967905 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8967906 we are trying to elaborate a strong text that will show our determination not to accept what is happening in georgia
8967907 but that is a sick imagination and probably that applies to sanctions as well i think it is a demonstration of complete confusion
8967908 the sco states express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the south ossetian issue and urge the sides to solve existing problems peacefully through dialogue and to make efforts facilitating reconciliation and talks
8967909 concerned about the latest changes in south ossetia and abkhazia
8967910 it was not the first painful clash with a hurdle in my career
8967911 but to trip at the ninth hurdle in the olympic final broke my heart rather than any bones i am trying to adopt a positive attitude i learnt a lot in beijing but i also ran three personal bests during this season and there are still several major competitions left i do not have to prove anything after all i am still the fastest high hurdler this year
8967912 while the practices of subcontracting and employing workers without social insurance continues opening new shipyards will only work to increase the problems 40 percent
8967913 just as y r k ali was declared as the chief efe due to his contribution to the winning of the war it is pretty normal to choose a woman chief efe
8967914 the tsk is the protector of the secular system and the principles of atat rk the republic is too important to leave in the hands of politicians and electors who vote for them the tsk is under the obligation to guard and protect the republic against the internal enemies of the secular system in the same way that it has to protect the our territorial integrity against external enemies
8967915 the fans are legal owners of the club whereas transfers at other clubs are decided by a few board members this decision will be taken by 30 000 board members
8967916 i love this and i thank you but we have important work to do tonight
8967917 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8967918 barack obama will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope
8967919 if like me you still believe america must always be a place called hope then join hillary chelsea and me in making senator barack obama the next president of the united states
8967920 his life is a 21st century incarnation of the american dream
8967921 his achievements are proof of our continuing progress toward a more perfect union of our founders dreams
8967922 the values of freedom and equal opportunity which have given him his historic chance will drive him as president to give all americans regardless of race religion gender sexual orientation of disability the chance to build a decent life and to show our humanity as well as our strength in the world
8967923 i received training in the education of disabled people in germany for five years to help these children more i accept these children as they are i believe that the most important subject to be dealt with in turkey is the education of disabled teenagers
8967924 the disabled teenagers try harder and harder to stand on their own feet and they are thirsty for learning some of them can even learn english german and japanese they make wonderful pictures and adornments they are proud of putting their handicrafts for sale in our kermes
8967925 i am glad to be back after a decade i really feel vindicated i feel great
8967926 second political tsunami the government is a titanic that will sink
8967927 anwar whatever we think of him and many of us are deeply skeptical is looking more and more like our future prime minister
8967928 there is a mounting sense of inevitability to his impending succession
8967929 clearly the prime minister has lost the mandate of the country
8967930 we cannot afford to have a weak leadership because it could lead to our downfall
8967931 there are environmentalists all around the world these people are engaged in such activities during their spare time
8967932 irrespective whether metu wants or not once development plans are completed the municipality will construct a road through metu territory to connect the konya and eski ehir highways
8967933 after thorough consideration it would be too dangerous to do so
8967934 ive told the police not to break up the crowd but to encourage people to leave
8967935 we wont leave government house as ordered by the civil court
8967936 our demands remain the same to have the government resign and to prevent an amendment of the 2007 constitution
8967937 as the police have so far shown restraint and resisted efforts to disperse the crowd by force and shoulder the consequences the pad is pinning its hopes on some men in green sharing its goal of toppling the government
8967938 samak would love to do a 1976 and go in and shoot them all down thats his style but the police desperately dont want that to happen because it would really do no good to anybody
8967939 we would be told not to raise our voice and accept the decision which was taken without even consulting with us
8967940 even if we have a solution in a year the devastating effects of the isolation will be felt for many years to come
8967941 when it comes to the issue of properties the compensation of the turkish side should cover a time span starting from 1963
8967942 as far as the turkish side is concerned there has never been equal opportunities ever since 1963
8967943 the meeting next wednesday is not a very critical one it will rather be a ceremonial meeting we will also set the procedures
8967944 christophias told me that unlike me he has to deal with the day to day business of the government due to his work load he wants to meet once a week
8967945 i dont see any argument other than ideology for him to seek a solution he is a communist so he should be seeking a solution
8967946 reunification is problematic but so is the division if we are recognized by 100 countries its fine but what happens if this number is limited to 20 then this wont solve the problem for us
8967947 in the process of economic globalization muslims are not separatists
8967948 economic integration with the world they say is a positive thing but they dont want it to undermine their cultural identity
8967949 especially the increasing connections of our economy with others around the world
8967950 negative feelings toward the u s and to a lesser extent european countries are widely seen as hostility toward the process of globalization of the inroads of the west into muslim societies
8967951 but while there is evidence that muslims do not want their culture to be changed to become like western culture we have found that they do want to be involved
8967952 we have no problems with the turkish football federation and we are informed that turks are eager to watch the match
8967953 the ones who will go to the game will not need to get visas and they will not pay the fee of 50 for entrance to the country that will make it easier for turks to come
8967954 no but it is so gross there at the restaurant only the daddies eat it
8967955 shhhh sweetie its okay im here with you and im not going anywhere
8967956 so how could they leave us kids here at home all alooooooooooooooone
8967957 in our factories there are different hours of lunch breaks for different groups of workers
8967958 i think you have all seen that the referee had a huge impact on tonights result
8967959 the goal was offside we were pressuring steaua just before conceding the goal we are sad to be heading to the uefa cup with such an unlucky goal
8967960 we were unlucky in both games we conceded an unlucky goal early in the first game
8967961 but when you are playing at that level you simply have to do better
8967962 we were sure that we won and with that complacency we conceded a goal
8967963 at the end we won and now we are in the champions league again
8967964 we wished galatasaray had won too because turkey gains points in the european rankings
8967965 thanks partly to disappearance of huge foreign exchange losses in the second quarter and strong revenue growth

8967969 in the absence of any increased availability of bank finance property values are likely to fall further
8967970 its hard to see any light at the end of the tunnel
8967971 banks will take an even tougher stance on providing loans to property firms after the bankruptcies and we will probably see more failures this year
8967972 the credit tightening contributed to the slowdown in the industry
8967973 companies that borrowed more than they should are responsible though government policy hasnt helped
8967974 everyone was asking me before what it was going to be like i was like i dont know i havent talked to her in 10 or 15 years i had that tension and i started to let it get to me is she going to be nice is it going to be a bad environment but when i saw her everything was fine
8967975 i think when youre 18 your personalities conflict then you meet up 10 or 15 years later and the playing ground is totally different and youre fine
8967976 it let me find a little bit of peace and discover who i was as a person
8967977 not the person who the press made me out to be because id had a few bad experiences in my personal life and i was struggling to figure out a bad husband or a bad boyfriend and i was doing it under the spotlight so i wasnt reacting well to any of it
8967978 i dont think we ever hit each other scratching im not going to deny that
8967979 all those people who wrote the i hate brenda newsletter are going to be mad at me now like why are you leaving your child with brenda
8967980 we provide data voice services to around 60 000 enterprises in turkey at present a substantial proportion of our corporate customer portfolio consists of small and medium size enterprises large firms such as ykm and vakko are among our customers
8967981 prices will decline further the next step will be shifting from minute calculations to a fixed monthly price for customers
8967982 we are currently offering intercity and international call services a regulation on local calls was issued however on t rk telekoms complaint the courts decided on a stay of execution
8967983 we expect necessary arrangements to be issued during the last quarter of this year and implemented at the beginning of 2009 any delay in the process is causing us to revise our investment plans
8967984 by paying a fixed monthly price consumers will make every call for the same price this is what is being implemented around the world
8967985 as ko net we will offer all of these services
8967986 india earns 19 2 billion annually from this business in case of installing fiber optic lines turkey may attract work such as call center and security camera monitoring from the european union and the united states
8967987 t rk telekom should develop fiber optic lines so that business and employment opportunities can emerge
8967988 this may affect negatively the profitability of spanish banks and their ability to lend
8967989 we see bonds being issued just to forward them directly to the ecb
8967990 one reason for that is the tighter credit conditions and anything which exacerbates that is bad news
8967991 if the ecb restricts the possibilities for using asset backed bonds in refinancing operations the market spread will widen again
8967992 such a tightening will hurt the part of the euro zone economy which is weakest right now

8968042 the most extreme case of overlooked diversity is the morphospecies apanteles leucostigmus
8968043 each attacking one or a very few closely related species of caterpillars
8968044 one of the messages of this paper is that you really need all of these different kinds of data in order to tell the species apart that just using the morphology alone or the genetic data or the ecological information alone isnt enough

8968266 the planning commission will include the director in the imrf retirement system through the county group
8968267 we voted on it in open session it wasnt just something phil and i worked up on our own half of the county board was there when it happened
8968268 there were two candidates interviewed for the position and we were going to extend the benefits package to either one
8968269 even though he worked for the planning commission it is maintained by the county board
8968270 we think this gis person can pick up duties presently done by the planning commission director mahler
8968271 this will take a couple of months to find somebody if they work a couple of months with mahler then he will be at retirement
8968272 i dont know if that eliminates me or if martin has another plan
8968273 if they would have told me a couple of years ago i could have went to school or had some type of training to learn about it

8968278 one opinion is from the states attorney the other is from the imrf
8968279 the person who had that job before did all of the books and payroll for himself
8968280 the line of causation goes to the planning commission but its ultimately a branch of the county
8968281 this sounds like it could represent one of those liabilities
8968282 hes mahler entitled to it it should have been addressed several years ago
8968283 i dont want to get a lawyer and give them 50 percent of what im entitled to but if i have to i will

8968297 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8968298 america is sinking and hes going to be the one that lifts us back up
8968299 and were worth that ultimately this isnt about barack it is so much about our future and what were going to do im so impassioned right now he really is for the people and thats why people are feeling so excited ive never been so excited about a candidate before

8968307 there are two schools of thought on co morbidity of depression and parkinsons
8968308 one is that the onset of depression precedes and possibly leads to parkinsons the other is that parkinsons disease predisposes for depression clinically theres evidence for both of those lines of thinking
8968309 were going to have some groups that undergo depression first then the parkinsons and then well do the reverse

8968471 to me this is a challenge when a certain person in the boxing industry hbos larry merchant first mentioned this it stuck in my head yes i am older and bigger and yes he is younger and stronger when freddie roach said manny pacquiao the fighter i trained can beat you it started to become personal to me to me its a challenge because people are talking about manny pacquiao can beat me well we will see on dec 6
8968472 this fight will really be a difficult fight for me but i know some people say it is a very easy fight for oscar but you know what i always do my job in the ring to give a good fight i think i can beat de la hoya i saw his last match and i think i am faster and stronger than him and i am younger also i believe i can beat him in the way that i beat david diaz in my last fight my speed oscar does have a height advantage but i believe i am stronger than him it is going to be a great fight on dec 6

8968475 unlicensed spectrum is great for short range coverage like wifi in a house
8968476 you need licensed spectrum in order to make sure a transmitter is protected from interference
8968477 its certainly something worth exploring rather than introducing potentially millions of tv viewers to unlicensed interference
8968478 the pro of licensing is that it would bring money to the treasury
8968479 the con is that it potentially stifles the creativity that may occur more freely in an unlicensed environment
8968480 our engineers may decide we might not be able to fit another license between those stations

8968482 the market is conjuring up images of a replay of three years ago when katrina wreaked havoc on the refinery system in the gulf so were seeing a little spike from that
8968483 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
8968484 if this turns out to be a nonevent the market could really come roaring back down
8968485 a comparable hit to production could easily send gasoline prices to new record highs with pump prices in the united states rising to us 5 per gallon and send natural gas prices spiking as well

8968492 they both get it right pretty much on the average
8968493 most households are kind of living day to day or paycheck to paycheck
8968494 so theyre very aware when they get pinched like this at the grocery store and the gas pump
8968495 they often think its going to be higher than it winds up being
8968496 expected inflation is a critical variable and one of the most important variables in economics
8968497 on an individual basis it effects decisions with what people are going to be doing with their savings
8968498 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house

8968500 i strongly believe that adding them polar bears that is not scientists to the list is the wrong move at this time my decision is based on a comprehensive review by state wildlife officials of scientific information from a broad range of climate ice and polar bear experts
8968501 overall we believe that the methods and analytical approaches used to examine the currently available information supports the primary conclusions and inferences stated in these 9 reports
8968502 polar bears are more numerous now than they were 40 years ago

8968510 when youre training and competing its like you have this baby for months its blossoming and then suddenly its over and your whole life changes
8968511 you go from the top of the world to pushing paper answering phones all this submissive behaviour that youre not used to
8968512 the air has just come out of the tires we come back to reality immediately and it can be pretty devastating
8968513 i looked around at friends and realized that im 10 or 15 years behind my schoolmates who built up a real career for themselves

8968515 the emotions were the same as if id lost a loved one
8968516 i loved my life as an athlete and now it was gone
8968517 she was surprised at the lack of commitment among some of the people she met there
8968518 here these athletes are working with a team that wants to be great that pushes to be the best then you come back to the real world where people function at a mediocre level and its frankly less inspiring
8968519 we have a remarkable ability to be in war zones and suppress all stress symptoms
8968520 there are two schools of thought on co morbidity of depression and parkinsons
8968521 one is that the onset of depression precedes and possibly leads to parkinsons the other is that parkinsons disease predisposes for depression clinically theres evidence for both of those lines of thinking
8968522 were going to have some groups that undergo depression first then the parkinsons and then well do the reverse
8968523 then there will be some that are combined depression then parkinsonism then further depression

8968529 there are people who still until this day havent won a championship i feel blessed that ive been able to get one and a gold medal as well ive been blessed that god put me into position to do both
8968530 this is the beginning of the building process but were starting at the front
8968531 we have enough on this team to have a good year like my rookie year we didnt win a championship but it was a special year a memorable year for the franchise for the players who i played with special years dont always end in championships

8968534 the rural resource centers are envisioned not to be providers of services but rather enablers of systematic care for veterans in rural communities
8968535 the objective is to conduct policy studies and analyses of data and to develop pilot projects to potentiate and enhance access
8968536 repositories of information and facilitators of information exchange within the veterans health administration nationwide as well with other government agencies such as the department of health and human services and the indian health service and with nongovernmental entities
8968537 in that way we will have real time communication of information across the three centers and across the system at large
8968538 the compilation of information and insights and their rapid dissemination will enhance the quality of service we provide to veterans in rural areas
8968539 it will take at least nine months to gain the intelligence
8968540 i will not be in dayton ohio so i think thats a fair assumption
8968541 ive just agreed to write a movie for sony and producer scott rudin about how facebook was invented i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page
8968542 i honestly dont know how im going to write the movie yet
8968543 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
8968544 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation

8968561 with todays current events traitor walks on thin ice with its story but succeeds at entertaining while not becoming too political
8968562 its not like traitor is a bad film its just that it is a film we have seen over and over again with a little bit of fbi vs terrorist cat and mouse game guiding the plot
8968563 it may dip a toe or two in the waters of previous international conspiracy thrillers but it works the genre with tremendous spirit and a robust sense of humanity eschewing standard action honors to observe the actual consequence of death
8968564 obviously the film is fairly low budget and at times it almost plays out like a slick cable movie but this is really a fairly minor problem
8968565 at times the film isnt sure where its going the international intrigue works against it for about half the film making the storyline and series of events ultimately confusing

8968596 there are certain stories that dont end the way that they end in the book its not really family stuff its more like well theres a bit in the book about demi moore and i dancing on the bar shes dancing up on me and humping me from behind the one part thats not in the book is that she was lactating at the time and she was squirting breast milk at my lesbian friends
8968597 my friend michelle called me the next morning and asked me
8968598 how the f k would i know call demi it was hysterical there are no pictures of it but it actually happened
8968599 because of the large deformation signals from the dike intrusion we needed to do some detailed detective work to prove the existence of this slow earthquake
8968600 we used state of the art insar satellite data to constrain the dike source and that allowed us to demonstrate the existence of the slow earthquake motions recorded by the gps stations on kilaueas flank
8968601 a dike intrusion could be seen with the seismic monitoring network the tiltmeters and the gps network but these slow earthquakes can only be seen with the gps network
8968602 wegens de flagrante aard van de fout zou hier een duidelijke en ondubbelzinnige rechtzetting op haar plaats zijn geweest
8968603 our goal is to identify biomarkers that will help predict which patients will respond to therapy against insulin like growth factor several inhibitors of the igf pathway are in patient studies right now theres a large movement to understand which patients will respond to these drugs this is a step toward that goal
8968604 we have technology now to allow us to globally assess what igf is doing in breast cancer at the whole gene expression level
8968605 this is one of the first studies to do that we know that igf is bad in cancer but now we can globally understand it in a more comprehensive manner it could lead to finding biomarkers for patients response
8968606 we found that igf i is a major regulator of cell growth and cell survival
8968607 if you have something regulating dna repair you want that turned off
8968608 once patients are resistant to hormone treatment as with tamoxifen their treatment options are limited a treatment that inhibited receptors for igf might give them another option
8968609 this new finding may help to explain why the clock is so far reaching in its effects on the organism
8968610 we found that some 25 percent of the genes in our model organism appear to be under clock control i wasnt suspecting anything remotely like that
8968611 it appears the clock influences a number of biological processes including cell cycling protein metabolism and varied signaling processes
8968612 but perhaps the most important role weve seen so far is the clocks role in ribosome biogenesis
8968613 the resulting molecular mechanism or genetic network for the clock identified by this mode guided discovery process will have a broad appeal to geneticists physiologists and those with an interest in signaling pathways
8968614 the methods used to characterize what makes a biological clock tick will have numerous applications in finding genetic networks describing other complex traits in many biological systems
8968615 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time

8968697 klubberne er blevet mere bevidst om listens betydning de vil dansk fodbold det bedste og s kan det selvf lgelig ogs komme dem selv til gavn hvis der kommer en ekstra billet til champions league jeg oplever at de danske klubber har en reel interesse for hvordan det g r for de andre danske hold
8968698 fck spillerne blev oprigtigt kede af at h re at fc midtlylland var blevet sl et ud af manchester city efter deres egen kamp i lillestr m og deres egen reaktion i denne kamp da lillestr m udlignede var at straks angribe for at vinde kampen selv om den videre deltagelse var sikret

8968797 steven gerrard has had the operation it was not serious but he will not be available until after the international break
8968798 i have spoken today to fabio capello about the situation he asked me how steven was and it was a good conversation everything was positive between us and i have explained to him the timing and when he will be fit
8968799 we had no option but to have the operation done now there will be another international break soon anyway and we could not wait any longer
8968800 the player had problems and we needed to do it straight away we had no choice fabio capello understands this
8968801 i do not know what response i will get on sunday from villa fans but i will be only concentrating on what goes on out on the pitch
8968802 i do not want to say too much i do not want to analyse too much what has gone on before because we cannot change things now
8968803 i am now only concerned with how to beat villa and how to control barry on the pitch
8968804 do i have a good relationship with martin oneill i dont think so but of course i will shake his hand i am a calm man and i do not have any problems with him about that
8968805 i had a good relationship with martin oneill before this summer and i was surprised at what has been said but i insist that i have not spoken to him since april
8968806 but i do not believe there will be any problem shaking hands we can do it
8968807 we know that barry is a good player very good for them we will try to contain him on the pitch and not talk too much about other things that have happened in the summer
8968808 it is important that we all concentrate on football but i expect barry to do his best for his team
8968809 as for the situation regarding the new stadium it is not something i can do anything about so i prefer to concentrate on the next game and beating aston villa
8968810 we are trying not to think about this we are concentrating on things we can have an effect on it is not good news but we cannot change things
8968811 at the moment i have too many other things to think about riera the champions league aston villa that is the immediate future i am concerned with
8968812 i understand very well our fans and what they may think but they will understand that i must concentrate on the next match and three more points
8968813 i am sure everyone thinks the same way about the stadium delays but it not something i can do anything about my responsibility now is to keep focused and think only of the points and improving
8968814 look at these gross republicans and they have these parties thrown by all these big corporations
8968815 how do i know this quack doctor is giving me the right information
8968816 i kinda wonder why obama went to that church and were going to have four people on to wonder about that too

8968897 this third party analysis shows volkswagens investment in tennessee will bring a significant economic benefit to both the people of tennessee and the chattanooga region
8968898 the study shows that for every dollar state and local governments have spent on this project on a one time basis well see a dollar in new tax receipts on an annual basis yielding a strong rate of return
8968899 the 22 billion in new business investment tennessees received over the past five years has had a significant positive impact on tennessees financial picture
8968900 the fact that tennessee has been able to lead the southeast in business tax growth during this period is a testament to our states strong business climate
8968901 weve taken a very conservative approach to estimating the economic impact of the vw project

8968910 we will use this period productively and revisit the plans for the stadium to increase its capacity to 73 000 seats
8968911 i enjoyed every minute at newcastle it was a fantastic club i enjoyed working with the manager and they are a great bunch of lads
8968912 but i knew offers had come in over the summer and the club had turned them down and the valuation of me wasnt reflected in the deal i was on
8968913 speaking to them i felt it was the right thing to put in a transfer request to show how i felt seeing as they didnt think they were on the same wavelength as me and they then made the decision to sell me
8968914 it was newcastles decision and now i am at aston villa a new contract was never discussed that was a source of frustration
8968915 i nearly signed two years ago that was a tough time for me and villa as well it obviously threw their plans into turmoil that was a tough time
8968916 you learn from that and you move on and two years later i am sure i am a stronger character and a better player for those experiences
8968917 the fee had been agreed i came down here to the training ground and got into the managers office and he said he had a phone call to say newcastle had changed their mind
8968918 at first i didnt know if it was the managers humor and whether he was joking with me but it wasnt a joke that is in the past and it is how you react to those sort of things
8968919 the best way i know is to get my head down and work hard i went back to newcastle and did as well as i could
8968920 he has been fantastic with me all the way through i had a great relationship with him learnt a lot and wish him every luck
8968921 we talked a few times and last night once the fee had been agreed he wished me every luck in the world and that is it basically
8968922 things change quickly in football all i know is the offer has been accepted and im a villa player now and the newcastle chapter is ended
8968923 to take off without being given permission and go on trial beggars belief
8968924 there is little doubt he will be disciplined in the most severe way possible
8968925 we are prepared to sell him but the price will have to be right he is a proven player with a transfer value
8968926 the offer is impossible to reject and not just because of the money
8968927 i have known about the interest of manchester city for some months but my club have not wanted to negotiate juventus also wanted me but i wanted to come to england and to manchester
8968928 if there is a moment in my career where i regret a decision it was clearly the day after the fa cup final when my agent told me club x wants you tomorrow and i told him no i love it here and i dont want to go i want to stay
8968929 thats the moment i regret after that day after that final i should have left chelsea and i would have the chance in wembley to say goodbye to the fans and to say goodbye to english football
8968930 so thats a moment i regret because the next season lasted only a couple of months
8968931 there were some very late challenges going in from fulham in the game last week but what can you do
8968932 im absolutely delighted to be here as everyone knows it has been drawn out for a few weeks between the clubs agreeing the fee and what have you but obviously im delighted to be here and to finally get it sorted i cant wait to crack on now
8968933 blackburn being a massive club and a premier league club was a chance that i couldnt really let go i did everything in my power to get here i was pleading with the chairman at mk dons to get the deal done and the chance to work with the gaffer once again was obviously a key factor
8968934 coming here is a fantastic opportunity for me and it is one that i am really relishing and i hope to take with both hands
8968935 we want to win trophies and i think it is time we did but arsene also believes in creating teams with a certain style
8968936 last year it was at midnight and we are ready to stay up all night this time if it is needed
8968937 for a while they all talk the talk and nothing happens then in the last four or five days every half an hour there is a headline saying someone has signed somewhere
8968938 when you have experience of transfer dealings you know that as long as something is not signed you know it can change very quickly so you can look very silly so you dont want to come out and announce it
8968939 we are ever confident that it the transfer will get done
8968940 that being the case he is our player for the next two seasons so you can draw your own conclusions from that in a healthy environment and in a team with a winning spirit there is no problem that cannot be sorted
8968941 the coach and the sports director want the player to stay and i am sure he will
8968942 our squad is complete and it is impossible for us to have one better than the one we have
8968943 our online partner kitbag always prepares in advance of any potential signings and unfortunately it accidentally made its way onto the site but has now been removed
8968944 he put his lincoln in hazard another car stopped behind us put his car in hazard as to assit us in the hazard situation
8968945 carl said get over in the driver seat and when he gave me the word put it in neutral so we can try to get his car out of the middle of the interstate
8968946 se les dice entre otras cosas que deben ir vestidos o que no tomen otro vino que no sea el del ribeiro
8968947 precisamente es lo que diferencia nuestra fiesta de las dem s fiestas hist ricas

8968950 se a economia crescer a uma taxa mais elevada em 2009 guardaremos mais recursos
8968951 foi uma solu o melhor do que simplesmente aumentar o super vit prim rio em 0 5 do pib pois com o fundo o estado brasileiro ter mais um instrumento de a o
8968952 a institui o de mecanismos dessa import ncia se faz com serenidade com calma e com um bom debate
8968953 o fsb n o deveria ser classificado como fundo de riqueza soberana
8968954 o que caracteriza os swfs serem constitu dos a partir de recursos origin rios ou da explora o de recursos naturais escassos ou de receitas de exporta o
8968955 o fsb seria constitu do com adicional de 0 5 meta do super vit prim rio como o brasil n o tem super vit fiscal n o poss vel classificar esse fundo como swf pois n o ser constitu do nem por reservas acumuladas a partir de super vits em transa es correntes nem de receitas da explora o de recursos naturais
8968956 s ado o de controles de capital impediria a aprecia o do real sobretudo em um momento como o atual em que o banco central voltou a elevar a meta da taxa selic
8968957 al m disso o brasil n o possui super vit nominal e j realiza um esfor o fiscal significativo a arrecada o fiscal adicional em fun o da elevada elasticidade das receitas tribut rias teria outros usos igualmente justific veis como a redu o da d vida mobili ria e o financiamento da infra estrutura
8968958 buscar alternativa para a aplica o das reservas internacionais brasileiras
8968959 considerando que a maior parte das reservas internacionais aplicada em ativos de curto prazo de baixo rendimento a cria o do fundo soberano brasileiro poderia ser uma alternativa lucrativa para o tesouro
8968960 o n vel das reservas oficiais brasileiras ainda baixo vis vis o passivo externo de curto prazo para permitir a constitui o de um fundo de riqueza soberana
8968961 n o ser um fundo estruturado porque temos um passivo muito grande precis vamos alavancar as reservas que est o aplicadas a juros muito baixos no money market que n o de risco mas que opera com taxas baixas
8968962 se n o h reservas suficientes n o se pode criar um fundo soberano
8968963 mas a sua id ia principal fazer hedging para reduzir custos de pagamento de juros entre as aplica es externas e internas e o custo do carregamento da d vida p blica
8968964 esse par metro tem como refer ncia um texto do fmi e se refere a uma m dia observada entre pa ses emergentes da am rica latina e da sia falta fazer um estudo sobre a economia brasileira
8968965 a petrobras n o tem direitos a blocos n o licitados do pr sal fora dessa peculiaridade claro que os acionistas t m todo direito de reclamar
8968966 um assunto que tem de ser aprofundado e n o est suficientemente maduro para que se comece a discutir em cima de posi es j preestabelecidas temos de dar um freio de arruma o nisso a sen o vira debate pol tico em detrimento de uma quest o que absolutamente fundamental para o futuro do brasil
8968967 estamos no limiar claro que vai fazer parte do debate pol tico mas os estudos t m de ser priorizados tenho um pouco de preocupa o que essa coisa saia do controle a vai virar uma babel
8968968 tem gente no governo que defende a cria o dessa empresa acho que precisamos avan ar mais temos de estudar melhor isso
8968969 im thinking of writing a book about minority women and how they fail to turn out to vote
8968970 great idea but i dont know zilch about making a film
8968971 what are they going to do help us make a documentary
8968972 hmmmmm making a documentary is one thing but a movement is a whole different animal
8968973 are you up for this ready to start and support a movement
8968974 imagine yourself sitting on a racehorse youre in the starting gate the bell goes off the gate flies up and your horse takes off i mean you are barely holding on and hoping the horse doesnt drop you off along the way
8968975 este tipo de fundo soberano bem antigo normalmente criado por pa ses com sobra de recursos super vites estruturais para compor o fundo o que n o o caso do brasil
8968976 nosso super vit conjuntural e n o podemos esquecer que a economia feita se sustenta gra as a uma carga tribut ria excessiva
8968977 o problema n o criar o fundo com recursos do petr leo isto pode ser positivo mas desde que se defina muito bem sua utilidade
8968978 no chile o fundo ligado ao cobre ajuda na estabiliza o fiscal ou seja quando o pre o do metal sobe o governo poupa os recursos para os momentos de baixa que afetariam a arrecada o
8968979 aqui pelo que se sabe a proposta um pouco diferente
8968980 o contr rio do que hoje feito normalmente os fundos soberanos investem em empresas estrangeiras visando elevar sua lucratividade
8968981 acho inevit vel que o brasil tenha um fundo soberano mas considero leg tima a discuss o sobre a origem dos recursos e sua finalidade
8968982 claro que o super vit prim rio sustentado por uma carga tribut ria elevada mas enquanto existir esta folga tribut ria melhor pouparmos os recursos
8968983 se n o estiver claro qual a finalidade do fundo pode ocorrer o que j acontece com os royalties usados para sustentar a m quina estatal e n o para investimento em educa o infra estrutura etc
8968984 a id ia do governo de criar um fundo soberano com os royalties est correta preciso perpetuar esta riqueza mas sei que falar mais f cil do que fazer por isto precisamos cuidar para que os recursos n o caiam no gasto comum
8968985 rakyat hidup sengsara kalau kami jadi kerajaan esok kami akan turunkan harga minyak
8968986 tak bolehkah saya ambil keuntungan daripada petronas untuk memberi subsidi minyak kepada rakyat
8968987 tak bolehkah saya ambil keuntungan daripada petronas untuk memberi bantuan kebajikan kepada rakyat dan wang pembangunan kepada negara now do not forget that thestar had a front page article showing how petronas petrodollars are used to fund the machinery of government every year

8969076 social tariffs are failing to help the most vulnerable households
8969077 only a minority of those in fuel poverty are on these tariffs and the rates are not always the cheapest offered by energy suppliers
8969078 the tariffs are not sufficiently publicised and are not included on price comparison websites
8969079 the government must address this injustice and force suppliers to offer poor and vulnerable households their cheapest prices

8969081 russia completely lost the information war in the first few days
8969082 then they realised the mistake and hit back they rolled out the general staff and then these interviews by medvedev
8969083 they have done better than they used to but they have a very long way to go
8969084 yes naturally certain conclusions will be made from this situation
8969085 practice has shown that a confrontation in such situations is not limited to armed conflict and diplomatic battles but is carried through into the communications sphere
8969086 unlike the georgian side which has been praised by some for a successful information campaign russia had not prepared for this war and was concerned above all not with the polemics of saakashvili but with the defence of its citizens
8969087 in this information war we still have much to do we have already spoken about this and we have received some very serious experience in the current situation
8969088 perhaps we did not fully appreciate the importance of the information bloc before

8969412 if the west reacts to the decision of dmitry medvedev by isolating the country the russian federation could revert to autarchy with an authoritarian power more harsh than
8969413 the russian elite passed a second point of no return not only in relations with the west but also in its internal policy
8969414 then this will give additional trump cards to forces which are insisting on autarchy and reliable exclusively on russias own forces for modernization
8969415 significantly more authoritarian than its analog of the times of the second administration of vladimir putin
8969416 contradicts the plan for the peaceful regulation of the situation in south ossetia proposed by french president nicholas sarkozy and signed by russian president dmitry medvedev
8969417 as a result of medvedev and putin we are being deprived of russia

8969420 migrated to holland from the czech republic as a jew and her mother according to some accounts is a polish jew and according to others a local dutch one
8969421 it becomes clear that in georgia have come to power georgian speaking jews who are supported by the united states and israel with arms and money for the transparent goal of creating another source of tension in the caucasus as an occasion for the interference of nato
8969422 the georgian attack on south ossetia took place a sizeable group of israeli journalists including from haaretz and the ynet portal arrived in georgia to make sure that the world knew from the start precisely georgias version of what was taking place rather than the truth
8969423 after russia illegally recognized the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia western countries ought to think about the independence of the north caucasus and chechnya
8969424 we will conduct a serious discussion on this theme russia accuses the west of double standards we will reply to these accusations of the kremlin and point to its double standards regarding chechnya and the north caucasus kavkazcenter com russ content 2008 08 28 60612 shtml

8969427 the events of the last month have shown the world
8969428 that the use of force by russia is intended to result in the restoration of the soviet union and the re establishment of the empire of evil the occupation policy which the kremlin is conducting must be condemned by all the civilized countries of the world
8969429 call upon the countries of europe and american to recognize the independence of the chechen republic the republic of daghestan and the republic of ingushetia
8969430 if this is not sufficient for an end of russian aggression then the international community should raise the question about the independence of the other autonomous republics of the russian federation

8969434 separatism is a terrible force which destroys the foundations of states and if it is given the chance to develop chaos will dominate the world
8969435 and if they all want political independence wars without end will begin
8969436 extremely dangerous for russia itself giving an impulse to the development of separatism in your country and in the future you will have many more problems than there are in georgia that is something that ought to be considered

8969441 but the most serious step which the united states and especially israel which by the way supplied arms to the georgians especially fear is the possible revision by russia of its foreign policy in relation to iran
8969442 could change the entire geopolitical picture of the contemporary world
8969443 russia would have the chance for the first time to stop suspicious ships and check their cargoes just as the americans have been cynically doing in this zone for many decades

8969456 it is in the nature of the georgian that when anyone interferes in his affairs his response will be an explosion of national pride

8969461 i understand they need to do the work but they should never have planned it for this weekend
8969462 the inability to get in and out of the city is ridiculous on the weekends
8969463 with this being such a big weekend with a large contingent of out of town visitors its going to be devastating
8969464 the goodyear blimp will provide great views of lane closings and miles of cars going nowhere
8969465 fans should come early so they dont miss any of the action
8969466 the ability for them to find clubs and other events in the city is going to be very very difficult
8969467 we need to welcome and support all the money these people spend in our local economy
8969468 not discourage them from ever wanting to come back here again
8969469 i have not been informed of any subsequent allegations by a proper authority
8969470 we view allegations of any sexual misconduct towards children with grave concern we are concerned for the well being of any child whether they now be adult or not who may have been subject to abuse
8969471 we strongly support the process of thoroughly investigating allegations of sexual misconduct towards children
8969472 during our inquiries we have obtained comprehensive statements from a number of people who have assisted with the investigation
8969473 i can understand it would be very difficult to come forward and discuss such matters but i would reassure anyone with information that a phone call to police would be dealt with in the strictest confidence
8969474 i understand the reason for that was that the vincentians could have fought the matter in civil court and it would have been very costly with regard to legal costs to them even if they had won unless costs were awarded against the alleged victim
8969475 all these buffer zones are legitimate and correspond to existing agreements
8969476 i dont think this issue is a small matter its best to look at it in its complexity
8969477 the parents who refuse vaccinations get an ethical free ride they get the benefits without taking any of the perceived risks

8969482 let a democrat say that an executive with 2 years of experience and no foreign policy expertise isnt ready for the presidency oh pretty please because you know what im going to do im going to take that soundbite put it in an ad slap obamas mug up there and run it over and over and over again
8969483 this is a sad moment and look hes not doing it
8969484 swung it once or twice and said i dont want to do it anymore
8969485 it was an emotional time and the children were happy they asked for it no one forced anyone
8969486 if id known this would be the result of breaking the law i would never have done it
8969487 this man not only abused the vulnerability of these children but also went against the wishes of his own community as well as knowingly breaking the law
8969488 the sensitivities this case raises both legal and cultural are significant
8969489 was not an attack upon the practices or ceremonies of shia muslims
8969490 indeed the prosecution relied as part of its evidence upon the president of the local shia community centre
8969491 we are satisfied that given the age of the children involved the coercion employed by syed mustafa zaidi who did not accept that he was wrong and the possibility of such an incident occurring again the decision to prosecute by the crown prosecution service was the correct one
8969492 this is a very unusual case and the first of its kind to be prosecuted by the cps in england and wales

8969499 a lot of them are out of the flds community because they are simply going through normal teenage rebellion and the culture isnt as accepting of it as the rest of society some leave on their own when they realize they cant live the strict way their parents demand of them there are different reasons for how they end up here

8969509 i didnt really decide i was going to apply to college until i came here
8969510 i dunno ill probably fail but its worth a shot
8969511 i really think the ones that were a little bit smart and a little bit rebellious were the ones who left if you see them here they were probably too smart for the community they came from
8969512 im completely honest with them about sexually transmitted diseases and try to answer their questions about sex honestly
8969513 ive asked the boys how they can believe in jesus or santa claus when theres no physical evidence for them but why they cant believe in dinosaurs when we do have physical evidence
8969514 its become kind of a competition for them to see who can do things like who gets the first ged its been exciting to see them realize what that piece of paper can do for them
8969515 i think theyll get their education and accomplish wonderful things
8969516 even if they come by just to shoot some pool or shoot the breeze it keeps off them the street and out of trouble
8969517 they have been transient but their relationships arent transient their relationships are forever

8969731 given st louis penchant for fermented beverages and the breweries that make them
8969732 it is perhaps not surprising that opera was first performed here in the 1880s and 1890s at a beer garden called uhrigs cave located at the corner of washington and jefferson above a deep cave which served as a natural refrigerator for patrons beverages
8969733 at any given time there are more than 50 singers on the mets roster who have come through our young artist program

8969738 indoctrinate white children with feelings of guilt over slavery in order to justify flooding britain with masses of third world immigrants
8969739 just be about slavery it is about the contribution that black and asian people have made throughout history
8969740 in addition we will soon be producing a definitive history of the arab muslim slave trade which dwarfed the european slave trade upon which the anti white government wishes to focus
8969741 we hear endlessly about the atlantic slave trade and whites are told to feel guilty about that but the truth is that the muslim slave trade was far bigger ran for far longer and was much more important than the european slave trade
8969742 isnt it strange how when non whites enslave each other and europeans no one says a word but when whites enslave others it is reason for a 200 year later fake guilt trip this is absurd nonsense and we reject it utterly
8969743 slavery was an evil which was abolished by the british government who then sought to suppress it elsewhere in the world
8969744 muslim slavery took place in west asia north africa east africa and certain parts of europe such as sicily iberia and england by the barbary pirates
8969745 in the early days of the first large islamic state during the 8th and 9th centuries most of the slaves were eastern europeans called saqaliba people from surrounding mediterranean areas peoples from the caucasus mountain regions such as georgia and armenia as well as black africans
8969746 between 11 and 18 million black africans were enslaved by muslims and sold across the red sea indian ocean and sahara desert during the great muslim slave trading time which ran from 650 ad to 1900 ad this easily dwarfed in both time and numbers any africans brought to the americas in the atlantic slave trade yet i dont see the government trying to make muslims feel guilty for these actions
8969747 in addition to the special downloadable articles we will be producing we are also working on a euro centric homeschooling curriculum which people will be able to use to counter the anti white propaganda coming from the government

8969866 barack obama is in the process of developing from a redeemer into a politician
8969867 that is a great disappointment for many of his supporters but it is necessary
8969868 i think it has strengthened his position in the campaign whether this now can be balanced by an equally strong performance of mccain waits to be seen
8969869 the best of obama as one would say about a music compilation
8969870 in all these months that ive followed him and listened to him i had never seen him so lively in such good form and especially and thats the novelty so aggressive
8969871 the prejudice in europe that americans are less interested in politics and the parties are not very different
8969872 this time the populace have really a choice the candidates represent different ideas and experiences
8969873 there is an enormous engagement and support for the candidates and europeans should try to learn from it

8969877 the pursuit of freedom as defined in an age of consumerism has induced a condition of dependence on imported goods on imported oil and on credit the chief desire of the american people
8969878 is that nothing should disrupt their access to these goods that oil and that credit the chief aim of the u s government is to satisfy that desire which it does in part of through the distribution of largesse here at home and in part through the pursuit of imperial ambitions abroad
8969879 all seven teams right now in the western conference have a legitimate shot and a strong chance to work themselves into the race its interesting if you see the match ups and how one game even one you arent involved in can impact how you play match ups and tie breakers could play a big impact in the placement of teams
8969880 2004 was similar with the olympic break and the one thing i learned from that year is its actually more what you do before the break than what you do after i dont remember exactly the standings from that year back then but i know that we were in a very good spot good enough where we actually lost five of our games after the break and we still were able to finish second we know we have our work cut out for us just like every other team its going to be a fight but we did well prior to the break and hopefully we can get back to that level in these next few games and see what happens from there once we hopefully make the playoffs
8969881 the pressure is all on steve and this is the beauty of boxing how he will respond to that
8969882 great athletes assume that and i think hes in that group
8969883 she said that three or four weeks into the season or even when she got back she really missed it
8969884 shes excited about coming back to play and has been following us shes feeling better and refreshed and shes going to go over and play in moscow so shell be in the same league as sue bird and lauren jackson and a lot of the players that play in our league
8969885 those were the words of jamie dimon ceo of jp morgan chase when he had his earnings call for q2 and indeed prime is terrible
8969886 with both oil and gasoline inventories much lower than when katrina and rita hit the price consequences could be even worse this time

8969888 this just underscores the vulnerability of what has been the only region where production is growing in the united states to hurricanes

8969890 theres no job too immense when youve got con fi dence
8969891 all flights have been cancelled and passengers are being advised to seek bookings with alternative airlines
8969892 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8969893 to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8969894 based on past experience the airline has a very short window in which to find financing as new bookings will dry up very quickly and suppliers are likely to demand cash payment for all products and services rendered
8969895 the news supports our view that the current challenging environment is likely to spark consolidation among canadian charter airlines and tour operators

8969908 unfortunately map only goes so far in telling you what was actually behind the expenditures
8969909 often the spending record data will dead end at professional services supplies or non contract purchases while its possible that some of these purchases are fairly innocuous the name of the vendor alone gives reason for taxpayers to at least question the expense the next step for map should be posting line item information from purchase receipts on the spending portal taxpayers need to see exactly how those funds were spent
8969910 after three years it seems evident that the failure to restore the rights of displaced residents is as much intentional as accidental
8969911 the disparate impact that this natural disaster continues to have on low income african american residents many of whom continue to be displaced more than two years after the hurricane
8969912 apparently the bush administration believes that international treaties and agreements apply only outside u s borders
8969913 every effort is made to ensure genuine consultation and participation of persons displaced by hurricane katrina in the design and implementation of all decisions affecting them
8969914 keeping the issues alive is part of our objective as we enter the fourth year after the hurricanes
8969915 with the pick of alaska governor sarah palin for his running mate john mccains race towards the bush administrations failed energy policy is now complete
8969916 john mccain was once willing to stand up to his own party but now that he is running for president he supports the same bush policies and powerful special interests that put us in the grip of the oil companies one of the last remaining independent policies putting him at odds with bush was his opposition to drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge yet he has now picked a running mate who has opposed holding big oil accountable and been dismissive of alternative energy while focusing her work on more oil drilling in a wildlife refuge and off of our coasts
8969917 palin herself told roll call earlier this week when i look every day the big oil companys building is right out there next to me and its quite a reminder that we should have mutually beneficial relationships with the oil industry
8969918 no one is closer to the the oil industry than governo palin
8969919 alternative energy solutions are far from imminent and would require more than 10 years to develop
8969920 senator mccain has lost any chance of having a balanced or moderate ticket with this choice and has instead opted for the same business as usual reliance on the outdated oil companies that has been the hallmark of the bush cheney administration on the third anniversay of the hurricane that knocked loose oil rigs and spilled millions of gallons of oil into the gulf coast that is bracing for another hit mccain is sending a terribly indifferent message by selecting a candidate who only repeats big oils talking points
8969921 senators obama and biden share the common goals of putting america back to work by building a balanced clean energy economy taking on big oil and meeting the challenge of global warming under their leadership our economy can become stronger and our world cleaner and safer

8969950 in spite of the rapid dispersal of the economic stimulus payments in the april to july period consumers pulled back on real spending in both june and july in the face of weak employment conditions higher energy prices and further declines in household net worth
