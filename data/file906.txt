9060002 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9060003 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9060004 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9060005 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9060006 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9060007 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9060008 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9060009 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9060010 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9060011 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this

9060013 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses

9060025 i have done a couple of events this year in front of my home crowd such as goodwood and the double 12 festival and you get to have some fun and spend some time with the fans
9060026 it is very important to me to have the chance to do this as the support i get from the fans is incredible and you must never take that for granted i think i will be in the mercedes benz display area for an interview over the tannoy and an autograph session on sunday morning then after that i will watch the race together with my family it will be like going back in time to three years ago
9060027 during which we looked to fine tune the car for this track as well as trying a few new things
9060028 now we have to try and do everything as well as possible to get back to winning again starting with the race in spa the world championship i will give it my best shot and then we can count the points at the end
9060029 i dont know if it was the team or the driver who made the error but first of all i cannot understand why the stewards made their decision only after the race
9060030 they have all the information that is needed to make a judgement during the grand prix
9060031 in the eyes of many the verdict underlines once again that in such cases ferrari is treated with kid gloves
9060032 im very happy today we had a good test after brno and now here today i feel that the tyres are much better at this track than they were there so i am feeling even more confident
9060033 the surface here is not new like it was in brno and this is better for michelin but we need to make one more step in order to be at the level that we want
9060034 this is definitely a different situation form the last two races
9060035 here as expected from last years data michelin tyres are more competitive and they are giving us the chance to be back at the top end of the classification
9060036 the test in brno was very important to improve the tyre situation but we still need to work more with michelin to further improve the grip level because were still not as fast as we would like to be
9060037 as world water availability begins to decline as the result of population growth overconsumption and climate change more water advocates are encouraging governments and consumers to internalize the true cost of water through an account of their water footprint
9060038 ive never had such a good rhythm in new zealand
9060039 we pushed has hard as we could we even closed to within seven tenths of the lead by the end of ss4 1 unfortunately we stalled before the start of ss4 2 and the engine refused to fire up again we had to push the car to get it started and we checked in late that cost us valuable time which we will need to try to claw back tomorrow
9060040 its very frustrating it was impossible to make full use of our cars potential the top coating of gravel was so thick in places that our tyres which we are no longer allowed to re cut werent able to eke out enough grip even running third on the road we were still sweeping a clearer line for those running behind us in the order i tried to profit as much as i could from the competitiveness of our car given the conditions im quite pleased with our day and we are in a good position for tomorrow
9060041 im pleased that my confidence and rhythm are coming back after my problems in germany it felt about 95 per cent this morning i found it harder to get my driving together this afternoon and hit a bank in the penultimate stage knocking the front bumper from the car the roads were quite dry but where it was wet the tracks were really slippery they didnt clean up as much as i thought i slowed towards the end of the penultimate stage to ensure a better road position for tomorrow third will be a good place to start it will be a challenging day but i really like those roads so im looking forward to it
9060042 today has been good for us especially with this being my first wrc event on gravel since greece last year this morning the car was not feeling great so we changed the rollbar at service which resulted in much less over steer and this helped my confidence a lot this afternoon
9060043 on the last two stages i was using a bit too much left foot braking and i lost the front brakes but apart from that everything went well this afternoon
9060044 it has been a great first day by fran ois after such a long break since his last gravel event in a world rally car he has picked up the pace over the course of the day and is now in a position to score good points for the stobart team
9060045 on the bright side im really familiar with both cars so i dont foresee any issues going from one to the other speed braking points theyre similar and i know everyone im working with theyre both very competitive cars and hopefully ill be able to come away with two good results
9060046 our cars have been getting more and more competitive all season long everyones been working so hard on the team especially last week after one of our transporters burned down on the way out to california i never saw a frown on one of the guys faces and we came through with a great result
9060047 we cant deny that the last couple of rallies have been difficult
9060048 but after our pre ulster test rob felt that the car was transformed and so when we were offered the opportunity to add flanders to our calendar it seemed an ideal chance to take the car to europe
9060049 ive been looking forward to this track more than any other circuit other than surfers paradise this year as it just looks like a good street circuit where you have to drive really well to get a quick lap as soon as i saw it i had a smile on my face
9060050 the same type of plug in exists for autodesk revit architecture and mep building information modeling applications but more designers and architects use google sketchup in the early stages of design when sustainability is best addressed according to don mclean ies founder and managing director
9060051 youve got to take it race by race theres no point dwelling on what happened i think the infineon weekend was just frustrating in the fact that the decisions we made were the wrong ones i guess after such a successful season so far we probably deserve one that didnt go our way
9060052 were still very confident and weve still got a big lead forty three points in two races is pretty hard to soak up but im sure penske and castroneves are going to do the best they can to try and take over that all in all though were pretty motivated
9060053 ive had a good day and ive never had such a good rhythm on these roads before obviously being first on the road wont be so easy tomorrow but im sure its going to be okay all i can do is try my best people want to see the same sort of close battle as last year well it looks like its going to happen
9060054 the first stage was really tough it was a bit of a surprise the car was much too hard and this was combined with the driving been too bad the tyre was too hard for the conditions but this is the same for everybody
9060055 we came out of the first stage and made some changes to the suspension on the car we softened it as much as we could this helped in the second stage and then in the third everything was going really well
9060056 i found the re run of pirongia west ss4 quite hard i couldnt find a rhythm in the stage its been a good day today though the car has been perfect and were in the best position possible now we have to stay there
9060057 the f3 euroseries is so competitive and everybody is at such a high level that it would definitely be a mistake to be too confident but having said that we showed that we are able to lead the championship at the start of the year and i have every confidence in the new evolutions brought to us by volkswagen and also by signature
9060058 now it is up to me to make the best of them and obviously the driver is a much more subjective variable than his machinery im feeling very positive so im confident that we can have a strong end to the season exactly what that will translate into in terms of results and classifications i dont yet know but theres still a long way to go
9060059 ive never had such a good rhythm in new zealand
9060060 we pushed has hard as we could we even closed to within seven tenths of the lead by the end of ss4 1 unfortunately we stalled before the start of ss4 2 and the engine refused to fire up again we had to push the car to get it started and we checked in late that cost us valuable time which we will need to try to claw back tomorrow

9060063 since launching the acura american le mans series programme in 2007 our goal has always been to compete at the highest level of sports car racing
9060064 the lmp1 class of the american le mans series represents the pinnacle of sports car racing in this country from both a competitive and technological standpoint
9060065 as we prepare to elevate acura to tier one status among luxury road cars we feel it only appropriate to make this move to the uppermost level of american le mans series competition as well
9060066 this is the logical next step in our business plan
9060067 the acura sports car programme has energised hpds associates and met numerous objectives during its first two seasons of american le mans series competition
9060068 when we are in a position to do so we need to be scoring with both cars
9060069 this is a very exciting occasion not just for lippo village but also indonesia as a whole
9060070 lippo wanted to bring a top international event to indonesia like a1gp world cup of motorsport and we are working very closely with the ikatan motor indonesia the ministry of youth and sport and rights holder carbon worldwide to make this event the pinnacle stop on the a1gp calendar for years to come
9060071 the track designers have conducted the initial site visit and are currently completing the final design
9060072 we intend for the track to be of the highest quality and through good planning offer minimal disruption to our residents and commercial enterprises

9060075 the number 99 is a magic number deviating from that is something we absolutely are not taking lightly said jeff gold who began working for the company when he was 14 i find significant discomfort emotionally about considering making the change he added that the company hadnt decided whether to change its name if prices were raised but other discount chains have weathered price increases without adopting new names when motel 6 opened in 1962 it cost 6 to rent a room for a night today rooms start at 29 99 but the company has stuck with its easy to recognize name people get used to it said laura rojo eddy a spokeswoman for motel 6 which has more than 900 locations even though the price is no longer 6 weve maintained the positioning of the brand which is to have the lowest price of any national chain for dj thergood who was picking up snack items at a 99 cents only in silver lake recently the retailers potential price increase always seemed like it was inevitable still you know the economy is hurting when things at the 99 cent store cost 2 said thergood 32 an echo park artist
9060076 its not the most pleasant ride of my life but i expected that in some of the right hand corners im probably not as quick as i should be but in t2 and t4 which are pretty much all left hand corners im one of the quickest
9060077 in some of the rights the injury is a little bit of a hindrance but its not a big deal i dont want to be a drama queen and make a big deal of it im not the first guy whos ridden injured its just the way it is and the main thing is that its good to be back
9060078 i crashed in the last left at the end of the afternoon it was an easy little crash i just held my foot up so it didnt touch the ground i was pushing hard it was my best lap so far i just hit a bump and lost the front ive been pushing the front a bit most of the day so i wasnt really shocked by it
9060079 the injury has responded well to treatment and is now much improved but the lack of sleep meant that it was difficult to concentrate fully ahead of this afternoons practice session
9060080 tomorrow ill be good to go and i hope that the lack of track time today wont stop us picking up where we left off at the last round
9060081 johns had very little sleep and we felt it would be too much of a risk to let him out on track particularly as hes still recovering from the recent surgery on his leg injuries
9060082 its a difficult decision to make particularly because he also missed the post race test last time out but we hope that tomorrow he will be fit enough to ride
9060083 we came here in good spirits following the last race but its been quite a frustrating day for us
9060084 we believe that he is ready for the challenge and he is looking forward to doing well at the tests
9060085 of the new generation s bastien buemi is the only one who can say he is really ready
9060086 for the others formula 1 is still some distance further away
9060087 i dont know what was wrong whether it was citroen playing tactics
9060088 i was forced to go first onto the stage and just went flat out and okay there was nothing much else i could do
9060089 it was a problem but for one time it went in a good way to help me
9060090 when we tried to start the engine it didnt work and we were just 30 seconds away to check in and so we had to find a solution and do what we could but it didnt work so we had to try and push the car and it was reverse downhill so we tried this way and finally we started the engine and we got going so okay we are not so bad at the moment second on the road but 28 seconds behind mikko thats a big gap i think but we will see
9060091 it got worse as the session went on so we decided to check it out with the clinica mobile and i couldnt believe it when they showed me the x ray it seems the bone i broke in 2003 has re opened
9060092 its not going to be easy and ill have to take care not to cause any further damage but my plan is to compete tomorrow
9060093 its a shame because other than that everything else went really well today
9060094 its nice to get off to a good start at this circuit we went well here last year and the bike and tyres seem to be working well already hopefully we can continue like this tomorrow
9060095 all i remember was that there was a white porsche in front of me and he checked up
9060096 when he swerved over in front of me i swerved to miss him and thats it im a little sore but good they wanted to take me to the hospital to take all the precautions
9060097 we made quite a good start today but not as good as we could have hoped so we still have some work to do in order to close the gap to casey
9060098 at the moment the main problem is t4 where i am quite slow and so we really need to look at the data and work out why
9060099 anyway were still second so were close but i hope tomorrow to be closer because it seems that everyone is quite competitive here so were going to have to work hard we have some ideas and we will see what we can do
9060100 its disappointing for sure but the car just got sideways and on full opposite lock i ended up cutting a corner too much and it just went over
9060101 but the car stood up well to the impact so were both ok we were pushing pretty hard this morning and maybe a little harder after the service but its just disappointing that we werent able to get closer to the pace
9060102 we seem to be giving away a little more in the slow stuff than the fast the grip was pretty tricky this morning but much better on the second passes as road cleaning is a big factor well take tomorrow as more testing and mileage and see what were able to do
9060103 i am very proud to have been able to put this project together and i believe the new enterprise will bring a lot of excitement and glory to our country
9060104 it is a unique situation to be able to take on these two roles i believe it is a great asset for me not just to be the driver but to also have a real involvement within the team structure i am really looking forward to racing for my country in the new a1gp car
9060105 we even closed to within seven tenths of the lead by the end of ss4 1 unfortunately we stalled before the start of ss4 2 and the engine refused to fire up again we had to push the car to get it started and we checked in late that cost us valuable time which we will need to try to claw back tomorrow
9060106 i am really happy with the way things went this afternoon because this morning things didnt go quite right at the start and the bike didnt work so well
9060107 we then changed to the new chassis and it was better straight away we made sure we set it up the best we could and i am really happy with how it worked i am sure we will all improve tomorrow and in the race and that we can carry on the great run the team is having
9060108 the bike worked pretty good straight out of the crate and some of the new parts we tested at brno worked well here
9060109 i am really happy with the way suzuki has worked to make the bike more competitive and it feels like we have taken a big step forward today
9060110 my prosperity is more important to god than anything else
9060111 bless those who persecute you bless and do not curse
9060112 don if only you had left that little smidge out
9060113 but alas i guess its not obvious to everyone that
9060114 we have tried to solve these problems ourselves but they are still there we need your help
9060115 hey did you ever think about this absurd mentality that has found its way into our culture
9060116 why yes but what allows individuals the perception of uniqueness is diversity and proximity those ideas and experiences that would be defined as unique are paralleled by the ideas and experiences of others but occur beyond the perception of the former individual this creates a unique experience even if it be to some degree an illusion

9060125 its channels of distribution however skillfully drawn will if dry and deserted of heaven convey nothing for human souls and the goodly apparatus of a strong and thick set establishment in the land will neither prevent nor alleviate the curse of its spiritual barrenness
9060126 a sure legal provision for the expense of the ministrations
9060127 for their food and their raiment and their sacred or even private edifices they may be indebted to the state but their creed and their discipline and their ritual and their articles of faith and their forumularies whether of doctrine or of devotion may be altogether their own
9060128 the ascendancy wherewith the pre existing superstition and ignorance both of princes and people had vested the ecclesiastical power of which it most unworthily availed itself to its own enormous aggrandizement in things temporal at once supplanting the rightful authority of god in his scriptures and substituting both a doctrine and discipline of its own by which to blind the souls of men and subjugate them to its sway
9060129 they did not with blind and headlong zeal demolish the old apparatus of distribution they substituted the true gospel for a false one and sent forth its now amended and purified lessons along the old pathways of conveyance
9060130 were the water of london to take on a deleterious tinge from the accession of some impurity the way surely is to purge it of this or if possible to bar the ingress of it rather than make insensate attacks on the subterranean machinery by which distribution is made of it through the streets of the city and into the houses of the citizens
9060131 there is no such intensity of desire or of demand for the article of christian instruction
9060132 there is no natural hungering and thirsting after righteousness and before man will seek that the want should be supplied the appetite must first be created
9060133 unlike to the other articles which are brought into a market and of which the supply is continued only because of an adequately returning price unlike to these the returns for the article of christian instruction are very often beneath the prime cost incurred in the preparation of it
9060134 after all there is not only false sentiment but even false arithmetic in the views of these gross mercantile calculators the universal scholarship for which we are contending would if carried into effect be indeed the cheapest defense of our nation whether its expenses shall be defrayed in the form of a liberality by the hands of private individuals or from the public treasury in the form of an endowment
9060135 we presume it to be agreed on both sides that the outcast millions ought to be reclaimed from the ignorance and irreligion of heathenism the only difference relates to the party at whose expense this great achievement ought to be perfected whether by private christians under the impulse of religious benevolence or by an enlightened government under the impulse of a paternal regard for the highest weal of its subject population
9060136 we the advocates of a national establishment hold it the duty and wisdom of every state thus to undertake for the education of the great family under its charge and to provide the requisite funds for the fulfillment of the enterprise and this without prejudice but the contrary to the liberality of those individuals who might choose of their own means to build more churches and maintain more ministers thus adding to the amount of christian instruction in the land
9060137 maintaining a calm and philosophic indifference to all the modes and varieties of religious belief should refuse to entertain the question in which of these varieties the people ought to be trained
9060138 the corporation of a state cannot be denaturalized or reduced to a sort of caput mortuum discharged of all soul and sentiment as if by a process of constitution making in the crucibles of a laboratory the cold metaphysical abstraction that is thereby engendered may exist in the region of the ideal but it does not exist in the region of the actual nor even in the region of the possible
9060139 an incalculable saving of the wealth and still more a saving to the happiness of the nation by the prevention of crime rather than its punishment
9060140 we behold in an ecclesiastical provision by the state an example of external voluntaryism or a willing public contributing of their wealth to the christian instruction of the common people through the medium of a willing government it only differs from a separate or a personal contribution by the channel of conveyance through which it passes
9060141 between the legal and the voluntary part of our conjunct operation

9060288 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9060289 her selection is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9060290 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9060291 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy
9060292 misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama

9060320 believe it or not i had never read kingdom come
9060321 when i did read it i was definitely a fan of that book i absolutely loved it i thought it was a wicked piece of fantasy art by alex and i told him his superman is the ultimate portrayal of superman in art i had never seen one better to be honest ive never seen anything like it so it was a real challenge for me to try and replicate that version graphically in justice society of america and it was really important that i pulled it off it has to be the same guy so its been a work in progress ever since
9060322 every time i finish a page i scan it and send it to everybody it goes to the editors it goes to geoff and it goes to alex as well
9060323 everybody has a chance to look at it that way we avoid mistakes and alex is so sharp at picking out things that may be wrong he caught a couple of really cool things that i didnt notice i just want his feedback especially on kingdom come superman because i want to get it right i have learned so much since i have been on this project working with these guys its been a great experience
9060324 we had absolutely no idea it would sell so well
9060325 it completely caught me by surprise i never expected the success of the book and i am really happy that it did turn out that way because we knew from beginning we were going to make the kind of book that we wanted to do
9060326 i love the comedy in comics specifically in the context of drawing realistically but also drawing funny
9060327 i dont think there is enough of that you dont see that a lot you saw it in the 70s but you dont see it a lot today especially in superheroes
9060328 ma hunkel is one of my favorites too id love to see her suit up and join the team in missions because i dont really think she should be baking cookies all of the time i think she is still pretty dangerous or she could be if she wanted to
9060329 i honestly think this book bridged the gap between the dcu mainstream and vertigo
9060330 we found a way to do superheroes that is pleasing to people thats acceptable to people and i think thats been the difference its not just macho hypercool superheroes everybodys got little different quirks their costumes have wrinkles they do the wrong thing they bump into walls and stuff and thats the appeal of the book
9060331 it has crossed my mind to leave i have been on the book for two years its a lot of work but i love these characters and i love the book it has crossed my mind to leave but there are no definite plans but yes i have thought about it maybe its time to move on maybe its time to let someone else have a crack at the jsa whoever it is i am sure they are going to have a lot of fun with what we leave behind at least what i leave behind

9060345 but there are things that bring good colors here in alaska
9060346 i love going up in the mountains in september here to see the yellows of the willows and the orange of the blueberries and the red of the bearberries and the purpley fireweed
9060347 one of the things that is really critical is cool nights
9060348 starting in september if it starts to get cool but not below freezing if you have clear cool days and cool nights it stimulates fall color
9060349 its all a pattern but its never the same which is whats really cool about it
9060350 its not uncommon to see trees turning colors sometimes even later than the first week of november
9060351 in the fall the leaves of the tree turn beautiful shades of pink and magenta
9060352 coming in and out of yosemite either on highway 41 from the south or highway 120 from the northwest there are a lot of dogwood trees right next to the highway

9060379 it was stressful and sometimes i didnt even want to wake up not knowing how i was going to put pampers on the 2 youngest or feed the two older ones
9060380 we were staying at meijer we were actually right in the entrance part and with us all we had some clothes food and a grocery cart not knowing what we were going to do
9060381 for single people were pretty closed to being full our family rooms are actually full and we have a waiting list with 2 3 families sometimes ten families on it
9060382 for some people thats like turning them away what we try to do is if we cant find them alternative housing we call another shelter
9060383 at ground level one can only imagine the sheer beauty of mountain ranges deserts and deltas seen high up from nasas satellites one can imagine yes however they wouldnt be quite prepared for the fact that from 400 miles away the earth transforms into abstract art the global landscape is impressionist cubist and pointillist mother nature is an abstract artist
9060384 weve secretly replaced these peoples windows vista with folgers crystals and the coffee actually works better as an operating system than the years in development software that microsoft created who knew

9060388 if my older brother ever sees the nn im in hell kill me
9060389 we were all invited to a special week long trip to do photo and video shoots in eleuthera in the bahamas
9060390 my boyfriend and i really want to try skydiving but were both poor students who are way too busy studying to get part time jobs so it looked like we were out of luck
9060391 my boyfriend and i really want to try skydiving but were both poor students who are way too busy studying to get part time jobs so it looked like we were out of luck
9060392 well i was mad at my boyfriend make that ex boyfriend and i was ma
9060393 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression
9060394 do you think its a valid argument that a john mccain administration would be a four year extension of the bush administration
9060395 sure but i think thats whats going to happen with obama too
9060396 they want more troops in afghanistan they want to send more support to georgia to protect the oil line there neither one says bring home the troops from iraq from the bases you know the bases are going to stay there the embassy as big as the vatican thats going to remain so their foreign policies are exactly the same theyre both very very aggressive with iran so i would say theres no difference
9060397 how would you handle these global threats then if its not to send our troops there and make sure that were protected
9060398 why are we on the borders of russia provoking the russians i mean the georgians initiated the military attack against these enclaves where there were mostly russians its the fact that were over there that we create these crises
9060399 isnt it part of our duty though to support these fledgling democracies that ask for our help
9060400 we should endorse the principle but not send troops and money once we get over there we just aggravate the situation
9060401 we bombed serbia in order for kosovo to become independent
9060402 now the russians are doing the same thing its this total inconsistency
9060403 you have to understand the enormity of the transformation we are trying to achieve here

9060405 i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring
9060406 45 years ago today brought americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a mall in washington before lincolns memorial and hear a young preacher from georgia
9060407 the men and women who gathered there couldve heard many things
9060408 but what the people heard instead people of every creed and colour from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked
9060409 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak47s out of the hands of criminals
9060410 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten per cent chance on change

9060415 each of you must give what you have decided in your heart not with regret or under compulsion since god loves a cheerful giver
9060416 each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give not reluctantly or under compulsion for god loves a cheerful giver
9060417 one man gives freely yet gains even more another withholds unduly but comes to poverty a generous man will prosper he who refreshes others will himself be refreshed
9060418 be careful not to do your acts of righteousness before men to be seen by them if you do you will have no reward from your father in heaven so when you give to the needy do not announce it with trumpets as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets to be honored by men i tell you the truth they have received their reward in full but when you give to the needy do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing so that your giving may be in secret then your father who sees what is done in secret will reward you
9060419 we remind the company that having set an example with mike carlton it may need to sack all the undersigned if it insists on this course of action
9060420 we believe the company hires columnists on the basis that they have principles it is wrong to sack them for the same reason
9060421 mike is not a member of the sydney morning herald staff
9060422 its not a half decent product its a very decent product its as normal
9060423 well reserve our rights on all of that and well make decisions as things evolve
9060424 not the hard news not the international news not the business sport local news that is not the part of the business that is being affected at all

9060436 to which restaurant can i take a teenage girl in paris
9060437 i thought it was unfair to us and to him
9060438 its a very reasoned response from those jurors because they apparently recognized this was not something they were well suited to determine
9060439 in my view its going to cause the u s attorneys to give a second thought to prosecuting soldiers for acts that occurred in combat
9060440 how many jurors have been involved in a domestic dispute in which a person was killed none you dont put those people on a jury
9060441 i dont think any of us who passed that legislation thought we were now going to have people discharged from the military being charged in federal court
9060442 there are all kinds of problems with witnesses and evidence and those kinds of things in addition to the fact that military persons are operating in an environment quite different from the normal street crime we see
9060443 but its worth taking a closer look at whether civilian juries will ever have the confidence to believe they can sit in judgment in these cases
9060444 the average american is reluctant to second guess the conduct of a service person in a combat zone
9060445 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat
9060446 i think god is reminding us that on the eve of katrina god can bring nature back
9060447 a good thing about the mausoleums is that caskets can be removed later if a family should come forth and want to bury them themselves

9060453 i am letting them enjoy their childhood as much as possible i let them go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things i think that comes naturally i want them to get to do things i didnt get to do
9060454 a lot of start ups fail because they run out of money

9060459 thats usually how it goes i was struggling to see the b all at the net a little bit with the crowd in the back in the second set it got tough he dug out some shots and everything seemed to go against me on those break points
9060460 i wasnt comfortable at the net from the start so it was kind of difficult mentally but it was actually fun playing this well and it really got the crowd into it
9060461 it was an unbelievable couple of weeks for me i left with good spirits instead of leaving on a quarterfinals loss
9060462 i was just happy that i was finally playing good doubles again because i never really did that well in doubles which was really disappointing for me i was really tired getting here from beijing but after that ive actually felt fine i was really eager to practice for singles again
9060463 sarah palin is a pleasant surprise for those of us who had hoped that senator mccain would pick a principled and authentic conservative pro life leader
9060464 the christians in orissa have fled for their lives into the forests
9060465 and some have been in hiding for three days without food or water
9060466 several of our pastors are in the forest along with their church people and one said that he could have escaped but would rather die with his people than leave them
9060467 unprecedented in his 30 years of ministry in south asia
9060468 i have never seen persecution so bad in my life
9060469 and i have seen a lot of opposition to the gospel over the years
9060470 yet this past year we have seen more people place their faith in jesus christ in orissa than in any other indian state
9060471 they are raping christian girls and some gang rapes are taking place
9060472 we are praying that the young women on our bible college campus will remain safe there are 250 students there and 90 of them are girls a handful of police officers are trying to protect them and that is a blessing but we have had people come on campus and attack students in the past so i am asking for all christians to pray for their protection
9060473 is that the radicals have not only incited this violence but they are also orchestrating it and the latest reports are that they are bringing in militants from gujarat chhattisgarh and other states to carry out their evil plans
9060474 between december 24 and january 15 some 730 christian homes and more than 100 churches were destroyed
9060475 several dozen christian women were sexually assaulted and more than 40 shops owned by christians were looted
9060476 most of the victims were dalits formerly known as untouchables
9060477 basically what we are facing is genocide ethnic cleansing against christians and so far no government has spoken out against it
9060478 please pray that god will intervene in this situation that his peace will descend on the people of orissa and that his message of love will fill the hearts of all of indias people
9060479 windfall profits taxes alone prevent additional investment in domestic production without new supplies from american reserves our dependency and addiction to foreign sources of oil will continue
9060480 over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in sheepshead bay on aug 29 2008 6 46 pm listen miles and common i dont need to explain how i raise my child a working mom does not miss out in fact my daughter has a better life because i do work and she will go to college and hopefully beyond because of my hardwork and money see i dont have to mooch off of the govt my husband and i work and pay our taxes if i ever found it to be a problem i would stop working mothers are multi taskers and some mothers are much better at it then others you are being close minded surprise surprise dont try to pin stereotypes on working moms and then berate others for doing the same regarding race truebomberfan on aug 29 2008 6 47 pm cont delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process

9060483 were extremely disappointed that the union is recommending that our employees reject what adds up to the best contract in the aerospace industry

9060490 the potential for a woman to be vice president will really make a difference for girls in this country
9060491 she is one of those people who will stand up and talk to you and tell you where she stands on the issues and make no bones about it she is quite capable and articulate and will make a great asset on the mccain ticket
9060492 if thats the case how come so many people have died and we dont know how many more will be showing symptoms
9060493 the ball fell through and consumer confidence is right down the tubes with respect to government and companies like maple leaf its absolutely outrageous
9060494 its affecting more and more people than you can possibly imagine
9060495 school lunches are going to have to be re thought hospitals cafeteria this is a major major consumer issue
9060496 they have to find out what caused this so that it can never happen again

9060505 i havent been playing much so its going to be good to start playing a few tournaments the fact that theres never been a repeat champion does put a lot of pressure on the defending champion but its just whoever plays best those two days is going to win

9060517 this happened quite soon after the original burial its not that a grave robber took it centuries later and hid it with the intention of coming back

9060525 animal crossing features three themes family friendship and community but the reason i wanted to investigate them was a result of being so lonely when i arrived in kyoto chiba is east of tokyo and quite a distance from kyoto and when i moved there i left my family and friends behind in doing so i realized that being close to them being able to spend time with them talk to them play with them was such a great important thing i wondered for a long time if there would be a way to recreate that feeling and that was the impetus behind the original animal crossing
9060526 youll also be able to do more than ever together when you play online youll be able to experience events or see concerts together for example and while in the ds version we discarded a lot of events that were popular in the gamecube version were bringing them back were including halloween were bringing back jingle the reindeer that visits during the holiday event and weve got some new events too for example during spring weve got a special visitor who brings paint and eggs so you can have an egg hunt and we also have a carnival thatll introduces another new character to the animal crossing world

9060560 weve already given them the zoning map its zoned for residential downtown 2 that includes temporary shelter services
9060561 the government had all this information months ago why didnt they come to us before this
9060562 there definitely is a need and documentation to support that
9060563 if the government had no intentions of funding this they shouldve said so right at the get go instead of making vicki jump through all these hoops unnecessarily im really disappointed they have left this to the 11th hour
9060564 presently the ytg receives funding for first nations and we let them know in a meeting that they can extend our money to the need which is angels nest
9060565 and once the shelter is established and has a history to it maybe we can assist them to get that funding on a regular basis
9060566 fabulous profits for the drug dealers could be ended overnight without prohibition
9060567 its so simple all it takes is the stroke of a pen
9060568 prohibition is designed to achieve nothing but its own perpetuation
9060569 its a great job guaranteer for cops its a war that cant be won
9060570 it makes working at mcdonalds for 8 an hour seem shall we say futile
9060571 theres only 45 dudes in the world more bad than me
9060572 i find that fantastic and they want to put me away for 20 years
9060573 nobody should be in jail for an hour for marijuana we live in a free society we should be able to do what we want to our own bodies
9060574 you will never date rape on pot no one has ever died of pot
9060575 ive never met an author who didnt smoke pot most journalists smoke pot every video game was made by a person smoking pot
9060576 and yet were hunted down like dogs it doesnt make any sense at all
9060577 absolute failure in every way we have to end prohibition
9060578 when it ends were going to look back on this terrible nightmare and be glad we woke up
9060579 i couldnt say anything i expected people not to be happy about it but i expected air time
9060580 its a public forum by two people who really believe what they believe in
9060581 i feel very positive the development will move forward in the direction that we have always said it would toward a residential commercial sustainable neighbourhood development
9060582 i have not been this confident with the process in close to eight years
9060583 the difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits
9060584 nest pas mort ce qui jamais dort et au long des si cles peut mourir m me la mort
9060585 cest assez bien surtout en physique mais les maths sont un peu justes est ce un manque de travail que pouvez vous nous dire pour nous rassurer
9060586 une cole avec un gros budget de pub mais avec un enseignement bof
9060587 im very interested in food and im really impressed by what theyve done here
9060588 ive heard about slow food and knew it was from italy but this is amazing the garden is beautiful and it should always be here
9060589 everyone said that slow food cant work in the united states
9060590 but it can food farming and environmental issues are closely linked
9060591 looking for one ticket for friday food pavilion and also looking for two tickets to sundays food pavilion at fort mason will pay 50 a ticket
9060592 in my family everyone loves sweets but no one wanted to cook
9060593 every holiday i was in the kitchen making cobblers and pies so now its a little business
9060594 at least some of that land could be turned into productive use food is an important issue and we need to support supporting local agriculture in a big way
9060595 unlikely to qualify for the list unless there is new information
9060596 our waterfront and other parts of cairns once held many places of such significance but they are all gone except for this one
9060597 once restored this building could continue as a commercially operated dance hall restaurant and bar but also be a living testament to those times tourists are looking for heritage tourism opportunities and cairns has so little
9060598 they need to understand that this was a very important place for our first citizens in their struggle to establish themselves in this hot and humid outpost
9060599 and then there were the servicemen and women who fought for this country in two world wars the fabric of their lives their heroism love stories tragedies and celebrations have all been inextricably linked to this building
9060600 we need his help to defend this small piece of cairns that has such a large history
9060601 the short term gain of funds for the site will be long forgotten like the early history of cairns if we lose the opportunity to develop this site as part of our heritage precinct
9060602 we urges the state government through its two shareholders in cairns ports john mickel and andrew fraser to halt the rapid progression of this decision and look for another way to achieve everybodys goals
9060603 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
9060604 who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
9060605 no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
9060606 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship
9060607 i want her to use the gifts she has in the best ways and to help others i said it from the very beginning show me who you walk with and i will tell you who you are people may deceive us but our eyes and facts dont open your eyes
9060608 fhasecure was a pr driven program created to show that the bush administration wasnt ignoring the mortgage crisis
9060609 i tell people in my organization do not ever come up to me and say
9060610 as soon as someone says you have to be on itunes theyre the no 1 retailer i dont have to because i remember being a kid when i heard a song that i liked i would jump on the bus ride to detroit get a 2 50 transfer and walk a mile to the hip hop store to buy the new eric b amp rakim record youre not going to stop people from obtaining what they want if its available at some level
9060611 we get so caught up in technology and ease of downloading a single theres nothing wrong with listening to a whole record from start to finish
9060612 i like branding opportunities when its something im into and im definitely into beer and cigars
9060613 you probably wont see me on the cover of a wheaties box or selling tide detergent because its irrelevant to me
9060614 looking forward to doing a lot of great things i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion
9060615 people see some of the things i do and they say why dont you show this to the world people dont know you do these things and maybe i will
9060616 that meant very much to me and seemed to be received so beautifully by the public and the world you know i enjoyed it very much
9060617 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
9060618 i am letting them enjoy their childhood as much as possible i let them go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things i think that comes naturally i want them to get to do things i didnt get to do
9060619 i get pretty emotional when i see them having a wonderful time
9060620 we are extremely proud of this opportunity to be a critical component of making fort pierce an international destination our program within the community is long term and will require a lot of participation between numerous public and private partnerships we recognize that downtown fort pierce is like a puzzle that we need to put together in order to be successful right now everyone is saying how do we make this area into a destination our plan is to put the puzzle together and turn the area into a shining example of what some of the best minds in the business visionary thinking commitment and community participation can do together
9060621 with one of the strongest balance sheets amongst our peers and relatively pristine asset quality we are in a fortunate position to continue to invest in our organization as part of our efforts to gain market share
9060622 christopher is a talented business executive who possesses strong relationship management finance and banking skills his respective areas of expertise further strengthen our ability to attract retain and develop accounts as we look to expand our presence in the los angeles market
9060623 coming to the knicks and hopefully being able to contribute means a lot to me
9060624 it has always been my dream to play for this team my goal is to show the coaches that i can play and do all that i can to help the team win some games
9060625 i am very happy my son will follow in my footsteps
9060626 hopefully he will have a long and productive career in new york i am proud of him and wish him nothing but success
9060627 patrick ewing will have an opportunity here to compete for a spot on our roster
9060628 he is a solid defensive player and a very good athlete
9060629 all of us got out some went in different directions
9060630 our daughter was here and she kept calling us to come here
9060631 when i left the city of new orleans i left with two pair of trousers handful of underwear couple of changing shirts
9060632 i paid the last payment after i got up here
9060633 its not ready because it has not recouped from the last one there are areas in new orleans that a lot of the folks say it looks just like it happened yesterday
9060634 theres no real light at the end of the tunnel for newspapers
9060635 its not clear where the revenues are going to bottom out
9060636 the cuts that theyve taken have not been able to compensate for the decline in revenue as the revenue picture becomes more bleak those cost actions have accelerated
9060637 online has not proven to be unaffected by economic conditions
9060638 they are making a lot of these cuts up front so they can be in a position to turn the organization around
9060639 theres certainly the risk that a number of newspaper companies could run out of time
9060640 before they make the transition online and theres no evidence that making such a transition is a certainty
9060641 it will pick up again if we dont diminish the product so much that they dont rebound
9060642 i thought it was unfair to us and to him
9060643 its a very reasoned response from those jurors because they apparently recognized this was not something they were well suited to determine
9060644 in my view its going to cause the u s attorneys to give a second thought to prosecuting soldiers for acts that occurred in combat
9060645 how many jurors have been involved in a domestic dispute in which a person was killed none you dont put those people on a jury
9060646 i dont think any of us who passed that legislation thought we were now going to have people discharged from the military being charged in federal court
9060647 there are all kinds of problems with witnesses and evidence and those kinds of things in addition to the fact that military persons are operating in an environment quite different from the normal street crime we see
9060648 but its worth taking a closer look at whether civilian juries will ever have the confidence to believe they can sit in judgment in these cases
9060649 the average american is reluctant to second guess the conduct of a service person in a combat zone
9060650 this is going to be a real good test for us because theyre going to come out and throw the ball at least 40 times
9060651 its a way for the secondary to make a name for ourselves in the first game
9060652 the michigan game was really a wake up call for us
9060653 we did not stop them the whole day they were up and down the field now when you go into the offseason at least you have something to point to when guys start thinking about how good they think they are
9060654 all you had to do is just turn on the film and just say hey guys lets just go back to last season and lets look at that and well see how good we really think we are
9060655 they do throw the ball around a lot and we do need to improve
9060656 this game just because of what happened last year is going to be an early test for us
9060657 every time you pick up the paper everyone is saying this team will go as their defense goes
9060658 our players are taking hold of that i dont know if itll be a rallying cry or what but i just know this theyll play a lot better than they played last year
9060659 when tottenham made their offer i was sceptical at first
9060660 we will fly to indianapolis for the entire week preparing for the bucs we will practice at lucas oil stadium and we will return to new orleans on friday
9060661 theyll reach out to a number of hotels to find out who has the room space and be able to handle all the food and beverage its a big process a quick process because of the situation but a big process to determine where they should stay
9060662 they want to try and keep their routine as much as possible they dont want to travel mid week itll mess up their training and practice routine
9060663 his repeated acts of self creation spoke to me the blunt poetry of his words his unadorned insistence on respect promised a new and uncompromising order martial in its discipline forged through sheer of will
9060664 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels
9060665 so nice to meet you hope to see you again
9060666 coming to the knicks and hopefully being able to contribute means a lot to me
9060667 it has been my dream to play for this team my goal is to show the coaches i can play and do all that i can to help the team win some games

9060675 it was a pity scholes was sent off and he will miss the first champions league match it was a bit unfortunate but it happens
9060676 el amor es el castigo que se nos impone a los que no sabemos estar solos
9060677 cabrera will throw a side line on wednesday and pitch the first game of the spilt doubleheader a week from saturday against oakland
9060678 the way im looking at it is although we dont agree with it we dont think he was intentionally throwing at anybody we have to accept it and move on
9060679 hes going to have a normal winter of rest and come to and go from there theres no purpose in him joining us for september
9060680 the s c o states express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the south ossetia issue and urge the sides to solve existing problems peacefully through dialogue and to make efforts facilitating reconciliation and talks
9060681 even if it is eager to support russia in its conflict with the west and this is not clear china is not eager to somehow put at risk its own problems with succession and regions
9060682 said he viewed russias actions in georgia with understanding russia either had to just walk past or stop the bloodshed of that long suffering people he said
9060683 send a serious signal to those who are trying to justify the aggression that was committed
9060684 it is well known who connived with the georgian authorities and even goaded them on in pursuit of their own selfish goals in these extreme conditions we stayed calm and continued a responsible and predictable line of policy
9060685 when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity we put into doubt the independence or existence of any country any nation
9060686 a man of words but not of deeds is like a garden full of weeds

9060702 the national marine fisheries service sets annual quotas for most popular fish species
9060703 the widespread torching of ethnic georgian villages inside south ossetia
9060704 who openly admitted that the houses were being burned by their associates explaining that the objective was to ensure that ethnic georgians would not have the houses to return to
9060705 the ossetians had cars outside and first looted everything they liked then they brought hay put it in the house and ignited it the house was burned in front of my eyes
9060706 i was beaten and my house was looted by ossetian militias three times during a single day after they took everything and there was nothing more to loot they brought petrol poured it everywhere in the rooms and outside the house and then put it on fire they made me watch as my house was fully burned
9060707 they ossetians came several times to my house and took everything they liked once there was nothing else to take they poured petrol and put it on fire i watched how they burned my house as well as my neighbors houses
9060708 ossetians first took out everything they could from my house then they brought hay put it in the house and put it on fire they did not allow us to take even our documents i saw how my house was completely burnt
9060709 taking pictures were burning these to make sure people have to houses to come back to otherwise if they come back therell be an enclave here again and we cant live with that we answer blood with blood what is happening here is an apocalypse do you understand people are turning into animals and theres no way back
9060710 do i look like a f ing georgian open your eyes you moron im russian f it
9060711 we dont foresee any sanctions decided on by the upcoming european council
9060712 i just dont see that the west in general or the united states in particular has any cards left to engage russia in some strategic game cheney may have a well deserved reputation for being hawkish but the us is not going to confront russia to maintain the territorial integrity of georgia and the russians know it
9060713 the europeans wont do anything to encourage a confrontation with russia they simply cant afford to do it
9060714 when tottenham made their offer i was sceptical at first
9060715 oversee and implement the companys recently announced capital management and credit loss reduction plan
9060716 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9060717 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9060718 no pens bamos llegar a las finales porque tuvimos problemas f sicos con los delanteros pero mantuvimos el esp ritu deportivo y tuvimos que esforzarnos mucho nos llena de orgullo el resultado
9060719 forget it im going home to watch tv call me when the apocalypse begins
9060720 im very happy the team played very well and we should be congratulated because united are a good team but zenit played well in attack and defence and im very happy today
9060721 dannys a good player he had a clause in his contract and its a lot of money but hes a very good footballer everybody could see that tonight
9060722 no one is closer to the oil industry than governor palin
9060723 polar bear populations have not been increasing for the past 30 years and thats a well known fact
9060724 in fact the polar bear population has actually declined by 20 percent in alaskas southern beaufort sea since the mid 1980s
9060725 the research reports with this information have been available to palin for more than a year
9060726 palin sued the interior department for putting polar bears on the endangered species list in the lawsuit filed this month in federal district court in the district of columbia palin argues that the governments move to list polar bears as endangered is not based on sound science and restricts oil and natural gas development the interior department had put the bears on the list in response to a lawsuit filed by environmental groups who argued that the bears are being threatened by global warming in an interview on the conservative cnn talk show hosted by glenn beck earlier this year palin said that she was worried that environmentalists are using the endangered species act to block the extraction of oil and gas
9060727 the number of polar bears has risen dramatically over the past 30 years
9060728 would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
9060729 alternative energy solutions are far from imminent and would require more than 10 years to develop
9060730 i beg to disagree with any candidate who would say we cant drill our way out of our problem
9060731 no one is closer to the oil industry than governor palin
9060732 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9060733 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9060734 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9060735 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9060736 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9060737 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9060738 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9060739 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9060740 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9060741 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9060742 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9060743 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9060744 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9060745 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9060746 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9060747 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9060748 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9060749 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9060750 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9060751 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9060752 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9060753 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9060754 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9060755 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9060756 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9060757 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9060758 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9060759 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9060760 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9060761 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9060762 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9060763 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

9060783 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9060784 progress continues and we are now planning to submit the environmental impact assessment report and application once there is greater clarity on carbon dioxide regulations and we are able to better align our project with the timing of our potential customers
9060785 we will be reaching out to the provincial government and regulators to discuss some of our concerns
9060786 this just gives us more options just to figure out what is the best thing to meet our potential customers needs
9060787 alberta has given industry clear signals to where we are headed when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions
9060788 alberta has been the regulator and we want to have one regulator when it comes to industry and will work with the federal government to ensure that alberta continues to be that regulator
9060789 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9060790 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9060791 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9060792 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9060793 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9060794 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9060795 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9060796 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9060797 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9060798 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9060799 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9060800 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9060801 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9060802 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9060803 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9060804 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9060805 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9060806 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9060807 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9060808 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9060809 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9060810 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9060811 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9060812 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9060813 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9060814 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9060815 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9060816 some of the attacks are just out and out false for example suggesting that the bush administration hasnt invested in alternative or renewable energies
9060817 this president has been unfairly attacked across the board by many democrats for quite a while
9060818 the concept of sexual addiction is a controversial one and thats because it is difficult to define
9060819 there are a lot of people who are critical of the concept because we live in a society that tends to over medicalize and which makes every behavior which deviates from the norm an addiction or a disorder
9060820 the internet has provided a level of access to pornography that was previously unavailable so many people have this problem and the internet has driven that
9060821 there is no question the character played by duchovny is sexually compulsive it has destroyed his marriage and the show shows some of the ramifications of the characters sexual behavior upon his daughter which is actually quite realistic
9060822 i have never been to those meetings its hurtful to my family and if i was involved with a woman in a monogamous relationship it would be hurtful to her
9060823 russia has recognized the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia we support russia russia is right and is defending its interests
9060824 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9060825 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9060826 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9060827 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9060828 promising and innovative changes in academics faculty students campus or facilities
9060829 the university of san diego is pleased to be recognized by our peers and included among the nations top universities on the move our students and faculty work hand in hand with administration to create ground breaking programs that meet the needs of todays inquiring students

9060833 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9060834 her selection is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9060835 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9060836 she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same
9060837 is one more indicator of this country moving forward the fact that youve got a woman
9060838 vice presidential nominee of one of the major parties i think is one more hit against that glass ceiling
9060839 i think you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9060840 he also wished her good luck but not too much luck
9060841 in case of war redzikowo and slupsk will be more secure than other places and not less secure
9060842 you condemned redzikowo and slupsk to annihilation like hiroshima and nagasaki
9060843 from the point of view of polands interests we will be strategically more secure
9060844 i am the last person to seek conflict with our neighbors but as prime minister i must not leave poland defenseless
9060845 can you deny that having the shield base redzikowo will be target no 1 for countries that dont agree with it
9060846 i prefer to have here american troops rather than soviet troops
9060847 depends on you how well you are able to seize that opportunity
9060848 russia has recognized the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia we support russia russia is right and is defending its interests
9060849 mccain declared as the pair stood together for the first time at a boisterous rally in ohio just days before the opening of the partys national convention
9060850 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9060851 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9060852 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9060853 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9060854 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9060855 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9060856 he sees sarah governor palin as the future of the party
9060857 these are people hed like to elevate in that regard reformers
9060858 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency
9060859 hundreds if not thousands will fall through the cracks of an evacuation plan and they will be left in the city not out of choice but out of necessity
9060860 my thing is my fright is if we have somebody in these houses and theyre not able to get out theyre going to perish
9060861 if i was the governor of louisiana id give the evacuation order as soon as possible
9060862 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9060863 after the current government is ousted we will propose a totally new political system with those corrupt guys prosecuted and we will have a clean and efficient political system
9060864 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
9060865 we dont just take what we want from other peoples dinners
9060866 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat
9060867 i think god is reminding us that on the eve of katrina god can bring nature back
9060868 a good thing about the mausoleums is that caskets can be removed later if a family should come forth and want to bury them themselves
9060869 we decided not to look backward we decided to look forward with all the progress weve made
9060870 nobody knew about his announcement this morning except a traveling aide and the governors chief of staff who found out about this last night
9060871 the fundamental principle behind any selection of a running mate would be whether that person is fully prepared to take over and shares your values your principles your philosophy and your priorities
9060872 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice
9060873 and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
9060874 john mccain followed her career and admired her tenacity and her many accomplishments
9060875 she was scheduled for a high profile speaking role at our convention and included in the vp selection process because of his admiration for her strong reform credentials
9060876 she gave a slightly different answer and left the door slightly open as opposed to shutting down all the speculation up front

9060884 online has not proven to be unaffected by economic conditions
9060885 they are making a lot of these cuts up front so they can be in a position to turn the organization around
9060886 theres certainly the risk that a number of newspaper companies could run out of time
9060887 before they make the transition online and theres no evidence that making such a transition is a certainty

9060907 again that opens up a whole other can of worms which is people instantly expecting it to be one to one swing controls and i dont know if wed be able to get it to the pinpoint accuracy that a game with this level of design requires so youd have to make gigantic surfaces you can swing onto rather than really tight skill based areas and that would shift more toward casual and bionic commando has never really be a game for casual players its one of those ideas on paper thats like yes the wii controller will work with bionic commando but when you actually try to design it out its like maybe maybe not i dont know
9060908 on motionplus ive only heard internally what people have said and i dont think everybody is sold on it 100 percent maybe its one of those where the programming has to get better for us to see more and more specific uses for it

9060914 die sternwarte ist sterreichs gr te und eine absolute sehensw rdigkeit in der ffentlichkeit aber viel zu wenig bekannt dabei k nnte das observatorium mit mehr besuchern auch nachhaltig werbung f r die astronomie als wissenschaft der zukunft machen
9060915 als tourismusorganisation des landes begr en wir dass dieses thema bei uns in nieder sterreich aufgegriffen wurde auch freuen wir uns dar ber dass es gelungen ist namhafte referenten f r das symposium zu gewinnen

9060930 entertainment events sports setzt frank stronachs magna racino in ebreichsdorf bezirk baden nach einer phase der neustrukturierung erneut zum galopp an
9060931 racino karren wieder flott zu machen stand doch das ehrgeizige etablissement mit dem un bersehbaren amerikanischen flair noch vor gut einem jahr knapp vor der schlie ung des pferderenn betriebes
9060932 urgestein in ebreichsdorf dabei setzt auf das neue racino konzept
9060933 schlie ger chten des vergangenen jahres meint sie gegen ber dem n wirtschaftspressedienst
9060934 wir sind noch jung und eben erst dabei uns zu etablieren
9060935 wir sind auf einem guten weg haben unsere kinderkrankheiten berstanden und wissen dass stronach hinter dem magna racino steht f r mich gibt es keinen sch neren arbeitsplatz sagt weigerstorfer die nebenbei frischgebackene landesmeisterin im dressurreiten ist lies

9060937 wir m ssen in der energieversorgung unabh ngiger werden und mehr die eigenen ressourcen vor der haust r nutzen sagte er
9060938 man muss ja auch die ertragsanteile an die gemeinden sehen
9060939 wir wollen die bedarfszuweisungen nicht mit der gie kanne aussch tten sondern gezielt
9060940 bedarfszuweisungen werden in zwei tranchen vergeben eine kommt noch ende des jahres so sobotka der insgesamt von den gemeinden auch mehr kooperationen einfordert
9060941 vp gemeinden leben eher solche kooperationen sagt er st dte wie schwechat ternitz oder wiener neustadt w rden weniger gut mit den nachbarn kooperieren
9060942 da werden wir einerseits die beratung durch das land verst rkt nutzen
9060943 eine neue schiene f r professionelles finanzmanagement er ffnen damit die gemeinden k nftig weniger gefahr laufen unseri sen finanzberatern oder gesch ftemachern auf den leim zu gehen
9060944 wir sind ja weder spekulanten noch idioten formuliert es riedl drastisch aber die moderne dienstleistungsgemeinde brauche auch die m glichkeit f r langfristige planungen neue finanzierungsinstrumente und veranlagungen zu nutzen
9060945 wir werden noch im dezember eine vorlage ausarbeiten auf deren basis die gemeindeaufsicht bei derartigen finanzierungsformen k nftig beraten soll au

9060950 aber weil die lohnnebenkosten einem kleinen unternehmen sehr stark zusetzen haben wir unseren mitarbeiterstab auf zwei vollzeitkr fte reduzieren m ssen sagt der gesch ftsf hrer
9060951 da wir uns schon seit ber 30 jahren mit dem an und verkauf gebrauchter modellbahnen besch ftigen profitieren wir hier von unseren historisch gewachsenen kontakten meint der gesch ftsf hrer
9060952 wir profitieren sicherlich davon dass sich mittlerweile auch ltere personen mit dem internet besch ftigen so tier haw nieder sterreich
9060953 wir halten beide ans tze f r richtig und wichtig
9060954 in unseren augen handeln eben nur diejenigen unternehmen verantwortungs und umweltbewusst die unter dem wirkungsvollen marketing schlagwort green it nicht nur ihre eigenen kosten minimieren sondern mehr tun die durch den einsatz von energieeffizienten technologien eingesparten mittel setzen wir f r den immer noch teureren strom aus regenerativen energien ein
9060955 kein unternehmen kann es sich leisten die steigende bedeutung von social media zu ignorieren
9060956 this is just one mans opinion but if espn is smart theyll keep the same broadcast team of dave neal dave archer and dave baker to do the early sec games in fact the sec should insist on it continuity is important especially in the over the air package of games which has played an important role in the growth of the conference on tv
9060957 let me be clear about this bury the daves club them with steel reinforced end zone pile ons feed them to moray eels make them call the games this season with cobras and black widows inside the press box whatever you do do not let them see the light of day
9060958 to return games that dont work with their computers for a full refund
9060959 to demand that games be released in a finished state
9060960 all the time but i just think it goes with the territory
9060961 i think that women we have to get away from the politics of victim this is about you go out there and you fight
9060962 i think that what hillary clinton did was tremendous for the country she has kicked open many doors which now we have to bring many more women through millions more women through my being speaker of the house was breaking the marble ceiling in congress which is hard sen clinton had a bigger challenge to run for president of the united states what we have to do now is say we have to translate that not just for individuals but for all women
9060963 it would be a clear sign from the mccain campaign that they were going to be making a very strong bid for the women whom they see up for grabs both the traditional swing independent suburbanites and then the hillary clinton supporters who remain disillusioned
9060964 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth on his plans
9060965 i simply dont think that the people of florida are gonna say the nominee of our party ought to be a person who on more than one occasion has expressed lack of understanding of our economy at a time when the economy is the number one issue that people are talking about here in the state of florida
9060966 i know that there are some people who think as sen mccain did he said you know some jobs are leaving michigan and theyre not coming back i disagree
9060967 some politicians as i said are more interested in insults than issues
9060968 with one of the strongest balance sheets amongst our peers and relatively pristine asset quality we are in a fortunate position to continue to invest in our organization as part of our efforts to gain market share
9060969 christopher is a talented business executive who possesses strong relationship management finance and banking skills his respective areas of expertise further strengthen our ability to attract retain and develop accounts as we look to expand our presence in the los angeles market
9060970 and this caused the fire to spread faster than expected in that area
9060971 generally speaking we only issue citations if theres not cooperation
9060972 and this caused the fire to spread faster than expected in that area
9060973 generally speaking we only issue citations if theres not cooperation
9060974 i thought heres another unknown untested from alaska that you question the electoral benefit it brings to the ticket
9060975 barack obamas campaign had an opportunity to put a strong woman on as everybodys president and they decided not to do it on a number of levels i think its a great idea
9060976 shes made more decisions as an executive than barack obama has ever made in his days as a state senator and in the few moments that hes been in the u s senate
9060977 his pick today proves that hes going to do what he wants to do and what he thinks is right and what he thinks is best and not what some poll tells him and not what his consultants or his advisors tell him
9060978 it appears at this point to be sort of cynical ploy to go after the hillary clinton supporters that seems to be one of the main strategies they saw a little thing in the polls that suggested that 20 percent of the hillary supporters are not going to vote for barack
9060979 she got a public policy perspective shes got an ideology and shes going for it shes not a shrinking violet
9060980 the grand old party is no longer grand its just old
9060981 i have never heard of her it is in my view still about what this election is all about that we cant have four more years of george bush
9060982 his selection of someone weve never heard of from alaska i dont think will change a thing for this election
9060983 wanted to split iraq into three different countries by ethnic lines
9060984 wanted to split iraqinto three different countries by ethnic lines
9060985 m aintain a unified iraq by decentralizing it andgiving kurds shiites and sunnis breathing room in their own regions
9060986 i know my mouths still moist from the trace of your kiss
9060987 el aumento sustancial de expositores de otros pa ses es el resultado de muchos a os de trabajo en los mercados internacionales
9060988 theres also this issue that on april18 she palin gave birth to a baby with down syndrome
9060989 when barack obama accepts the democratic nomination to become the president of the united states of america and starts speaking i think all of america and many parts of the world the hopes the longings the aspirations and the dreams will be hanging on every word he says
9060990 its going to be incredible you know people died some people didnt make it to the march on washington they were beaten they were tear gassed some were shot and killed and even after the march on washington where there had been so much hope so much optimism we had the terrible bombing in a church in birmingham where four little girls were killed i thought i cried all my tears
9060991 i was young na ve enough to think i would see that in 5 10 years
9060992 then you see leaders killed you see police brutality residential segregation in cities about 10 years ago i thought i wont see this this is something for my grandchildren

9060995 while the mccain republicans have launched brutal personal and callow attacks on obamas integrity sincerity and patriotism the obama democrats have treated mccain with respect and deference more respect and deference than his nasty petty little campaign deserves they are taking a risk they are living their message even as mccain is trashing his own reputation with the asinine adolescent weekly standard brattishness that is now his trademark
9060996 the series simply shows them in a more vulnerable pose than the public is accustomed

9061013 for 30 years i have witnessed congress dangling a carrot in front of amtraks eyes funding it just enough for it to limp along and ill tell you this has to stop now is the time to commit politically and financially to a strong safe and efficient passenger rail system
9061014 theres only two parts of the country that can support a viable rail system the northeast and the far west
9061015 shes either grossly misinformed or intentionally misleading and both are unbecoming
9061016 even the bush administration cant deny the reality of global warming
9061017 the governor is aligning herself and the state of alaska with the most discredited fringe extreme viewpoints by denying this
9061018 unfortunately its what we might expect to see if bears are forced to swim longer distances

9061040 i mean people have access to health care in america after all you just go to an emergency room
9061041 it is not the critic who counts the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes up short again and again who if he fails at least he fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat
9061042 i demolished my kitchen and rebuilt it which was really therapeutic
9061043 i knew the trend would hit the wall but i found it hard not to focus on what customers were begging for
9061044 ive learned to tell retailers what they should want and not simply listen to their requests it helps the brand in the long term
9061045 when i found out about it i felt like it was the end of my career
9061046 i wiped my mind clean and clear of the problem and came back with some clarity
9061047 a lot of times i find problems arent as bad as i think they are but my reaction to them is horrendous at first its the hardest thing in the world to walk away
9061048 and my mother lovingly told me it was because i was so bright i couldnt get the thoughts out quickly enough
9061049 one year ago the bush administration proactively provided an affordable safety net to homeowners who wanted to stay in their homes
9061050 today with the expansion firmly in place hundreds of thousands of families are in a better place thanks to fha federal housing administration
9061051 the deal is that true fhasecure delinquent loan refinance activity has been so low that hud decided to call all of its refinance business fhasecure
9061052 in theory the program could be expanded to accommodate more delinquent borrowers without loosening underwriting or taking on any more risk but hud and the bush administration has been reluctant to do so
9061053 fhasecure was a pr driven program created to show that the bush administration wasnt ignoring the mortgage crisis
9061054 were trying to make the point to families were there for you with any new program the word has to get out
9061055 how far do you open the door and how many borrowers are beyond rescue you have to draw a line and say youll insure some borrowers on one side of the line and not others its really a policy discussion thats beyond me to opine on
9061056 a remake with current graphics and gameplay styles or a retro ish remake
9061057 really the best reception weve had for any housemate all series
9061058 i think theyve stuck together i knew it was going that way nothing has come as a shock
9061059 ive got a good heart i would share the lads are gamblers theyre risk takers it showed the way they grabbed their food and drink within the house its gonna cause a little bit of jealousy
9061060 hes quite controlling ive had a go at rex before about the way he speaks to people rex tried it on with me a little bit tried to talk down to me but since i had a word hes not done it
9061061 it was a total shock it was so romantic it was like a movie worth waiting for it means so much
9061062 who is that crazy woman we saw the little green man move and in the morning the tent was gone i had 100 guinea pigs but just a few of them trotted to the fridge its the way i word it
9061063 she followed us everywhere she was flirting with mario it was quite obvious maybe its just insecurities youre in a small space mario had just got married you get paranoid
9061064 permission was not sought or granted nor would it have been given
9061065 john mccains running mate is for big oil and against the environment
9061066 if you are not for opening anwr in the state of alaska you couldnt get elected dogcatcher
9061067 i am pleased to see sen obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs

9061070 we have roughly 10 of our volunteers in gaza and we have to get them
9061071 we need to get the passengers together hopefully within a month
9061072 this might be the beginning of a simple delivery service if we can set up the mechanisms here in cyprus this can be used as a model for what can be made more permanent
9061073 i hope to get an artificial leg so i can have a chance at walking again
9061074 i dont have a real life in gaza its full of death and chaos
9061075 it is as absurd to argue men as to torture them into believing
9061076 firmly believe all the worlds problems can be solved through awareness meaning the process of making other people aware of problems magically causing someone else like the government to fix it
9061077 if given money and education all poor people would be exactly like them
9061078 it is essential that you make it clear that poor people do not make decisions based on free will
9061079 at least until they have to wait in line for an mri this is very similar to the way that white people express their support for public school when they dont have children
9061080 the film maker who has produced a body of work responsible for reaffirming things that white people already believe in perhaps you noticed the increase in health care policy scholars in 2007 or american foreign policy experts in 2004 or gun control pundits in 2002
9061081 though he would likely hate them all white people cannot get enough of
9061082 if you ever mention fox news you will have lost respect and credibility to such a high degree that you might have to move
9061083 moving to a small town and telling the local residents how they are awful and uncultured
9061084 white people like barack obama because they are afraid that if they dont they will be considered racist
9061085 whole foods stores have replaced churches and cathedrals as the most important and relevant buildings in white society
9061086 if a white person is a self proclaimed nerd i e millinerd all jokes around the topic are essentially their opportunity to say that they are smarter than you
9061087 the anatomy of a blog makes serious conversation all but impossible
9061088 blogging is as melancholic and illusionary as don quixote tilting at windmills
9061089 the breezy style is often the work of an egocentric the person who imagines that everything that comes to mind is of general interest and that uninhibited prose creates high spirits and carries the day
9061090 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat
9061091 the water is rising fast and there is widespread looting down here
9061092 the people are even stripping the material from one of the bridges it is awful
9061093 weve designed it for 72 routes to be encompassed in this building
9061094 you basically have a rush of people in the morning a rush of people in the evening and a lot of quiet time
9061095 its become more crowded and actually sort of dangerous in the building
9061096 we feel this puts us in good shape for doing things together and going forward
9061097 when we split off that was something we had to consider repaying so they basically said thats forgiven
9061098 as any economist knows a monopoly will always raise prices and lower quality
9061099 theyve inflated the cost of health care by creating a monopoly
9061100 a man speaking in broken english maybe french or mid eastern told me to deposit the check in my account and then to call him back for additional instructions
9061101 these letters and checks did not originate from maaco and if you try to cash the check you may also become victims of this mail attack please do not try to cash these checks
9061102 our bank has reversed the checks but the scam is damaging our reputation and is misleading the public
9061103 i would really be worried if trees were flooded 10 days to two weeks the trees would really suffer
9061104 they could easily lose 10 percent to 25 percent of their crop
9061105 we still have standing water we still have dikes failing
9061106 there are many other growers in the area who still have a lot of water
9061107 ive been here since the 1950s and ive never seen this part of florida this wet for this long
9061108 there are large regions tens of thousands of acres that have had water for more than a week
9061109 i am relieved to find that federal judges are not above the law and that sexual abuse in the workplace is never acceptable no matter the status of the offender
9061110 they worked together for six years on a daily basis
9061111 the first time she ever complained was when she was about to get fired this is a classic swearing match
9061112 if they cant agree on what happened how can a jury agree
9061113 i was shocked that judge kents conduct was not viewed more seriously and that he would be allowed to sit in judgment of others
9061114 these witnesses are all a bunch of criminals and liars
9061115 were going to do a little more for different crowds
9061116 our new philosophy is that we have to compete against all bands not just certain bands thats how it is now
9061117 i hope they like it i think theyll like the music
9061118 the centre of gustav will pass near or over the cayman islands later today friday over the western portions of cuba on saturday and into the southern gulf of mexico on sunday
9061119 gustav could become a major hurricane before reaching western cuba
9061120 it is total devastation everywhere several residents are now crammed into disaster shelters here in east portland and the weather continues to make the situation worse
9061121 memphis historically has been a very strong and progressive health care community
9061122 its a growing industry and as it grows it becomes more complicated and brings its own challenges it was a natural progression for us to want to enhance and improve our service line by adding a division of expertise
9061123 all of my attention will be focused on the medical community
9061124 we will work closely with their long term goals in their health care system
9061125 its the combination of lauras experience interest passion and knowledge with our extensive experience research and knowledge of the real estate industry that makes a very powerful combination
9061126 theres a lot about what we do in health care that is completely anomalous compared to other businesses across the city
9061127 see ive known terror for quite some time 57 years so cruel terror breathes the air i breathe its the checkpoint on my way to school terror is the robbery of my land and the torture of my mother the imprisonment of my innocent father the bullet in my baby brother the bulldozers and the tanks the gases and the guns the bombs that fall outside my door all due to your funds you blame me for defending myself against the ways of my enemies im terrorized in my own land what and im the terrorist
9061128 anyone who had anything to do with randalls neighborhood or her gun range has their head on the chopping block i dont support that whatsoever
9061129 its just a stalling tactic on her part to force us to put in the budget what she wants to
9061130 we have roughly 10 of our volunteers in gaza and we have to get them
9061131 we need to get the passengers together hopefully within a month
9061132 this might be the beginning of a simple delivery service if we can set up the mechanisms here in cyprus this can be used as a model for what can be made more permanent
9061133 cabrera will throw a side line on wednesday and pitch the first game of the spilt doubleheader a week from saturday against oakland
9061134 dass das internet verst rkt als kommunikations und ausbildungsplattform des internationalen terrorismus genutzt wird
9061135 i am going to be an advocate for the noncivil service employee
9061136 fire and police have an advocate and a political group noncivil service employees dont have anyone to speak for them
9061137 the reason we need a raise is that gas prices are going up grocery store prices are going up some guys out here have two or three jobs trying to make ends meet

9061139 a racist white bitch out to get black male students
9061140 are you sure you want to play the only card in your deck on this issue
9061141 some mean boy pushed me down and told me to go back to elementary squirt
9061142 just know that i am exhausted and going to bed early because i get to make a difference all over again tomorrow
9061143 ich werde in den n chsten wochen entscheiden was ich mache es gibt zwei m glichkeiten entweder man greift nochmal an oder man berlegt sich wie lange man das noch mitmacht
9061144 denn eigentlich will ich noch weitermachen doch es ist mental sehr hart wenn immer wieder r ckschl ge kommen
9061145 dabei habe ich immer gedacht dass ich dieses spiel nicht verlieren kann
9061146 ich mag dieses turnier wenn man hier auf den gro en pl tzen spielt bekommt man eine g nsehaut das ist dann wie eine sucht
9061147 ich kann f r eine berraschung sorgen denn ich habe zuletzt viel selbstvertrauen getankt

9061149 ich habe mich freiwillig in eine einrichtung f r die behandlung von sexabh ngigkeit begeben
9061150 wer wie es politiker propagieren die fl chendeckende versorgung mit freien rzten sichern will darf sich nun nicht ausruhen
9061151 w ssten mediziner etwa wirklich zuverl ssig wie viel geld sie f r ihre leistungen erhalten d rften sie wieder mehr freude an ihrem beruf haben der bankbesuch als nebensache und die behandlung der patienten als wahre herausforderung dieses system verdiente die bezeichnung gesund
9061152 um 2 7 milliarden euro oder satte zehn prozent steigen die honorare f r rzte ein gro er schluck aus der pulle f r einen personenkreis der wahrlich nicht zu den geringverdienern geh rt es aber gl nzend versteht sich arm zu rechnen es spricht b nde dass die gesundheitsministerin sich gem igt f hlt bei den rzten entsprechende gegenleistungen anzumahnen
9061153 der widerstand der kassen gegen die forderungen war erfolglos denn den finanziellen rahmen hatte gesundheitsministerin ulla schmidt vorgegeben freundlich assistiert von bayerns ministerpr sident g nther beckstein die eine wollte sich das
9061154 trotzdem w re ein so happiger honorarzuschlag allenfalls dann gerechtfertigt gewesen wenn durch die mehrzahlungen haupts chlich qualitativ hochwertige behandlung belohnt worden w re daran allerdings hatte niemand gro es interesse leider
9061155 dass sich mit der honorarerh hung auch der rztemangel auf dem flachen land beheben l sst wie es die kbv jetzt erwartet
9061156 dass im osten deutschlands wo in manchen gegenden das fehlen von rzten gravierend sp rbar ist nun mehr geld ausgegeben werden kann 200 millionen euro sind f r die fast angleichung der honorare an das westniveau vereinbart worden doch auch die bisherigen bem hungen sind oft gescheitert etwa mit umsatzgarantien die unlust der mediziner zu bek mpfen sich abseits der ballungsr ume im osten niederzulassen
9061157 steigende beitr ge allein auf h here arzthonorare zu schieben ist eine erkl rung die

9061160 una victoria en este momento nos vendr a muy bien tenemos la capacidad y todo est en nuestras manos para levantar estoy seguro de que vamos a ganar
9061161 este equipo sabe responder en los momentos adversos todos estamos conscientes de que hemos cometido errores que nos han costado goles
9061162 tiene jugadores de gran calidad y bien dirigidos por benjam n galindo
9061163 y el que est mejor ser el que se llevar los tres puntos
9061164 vengo a ganar por cualquier v a a hacer mi trabajo y a derrotar a calder n para llevarme mi t tulo
9061165 vamos a estar m s r pidos y a ganar este pleito aunque tenga que perseguirlo por todo el cuadril tero
9061166 hemos hecho un entrenamiento tremendo y estoy en muy buenas condiciones voy a demostrar que soy el mejor 108 libras el s bado
9061167 creo que viene por el mismo camino de la del a o pasado una pelea bien fuerte c zares viene con muchas ganas y hay que ver qu tipo de estrategia ha preparado para esta pelea
9061168 es una pelea bien cuesta arriba yo le voy al m o pero no creo que iv n va a ganar por nocaut creo que debe tener el mismo ritmo de pelea que en la anterior movi ndose dando y que no le den y hacer un trabajo inteligente
9061169 hemos hecho un gran esfuerzo para contar con este bal n desde la jornada site
9061170 originalmente se iba a utilizar en las jornadas ocho y nueve pero se hizo todo lo posible en conjunto con voit para que los esf ricos llegaran desde pakist n en un avi n privado y pudieran rodar en la cancha desde el 30 de agosto d a que se celebra la marcha por un m xico seguro
9061171 aunque la gran mayor a de los equipos jugadores y directivos del futbol mexicano por sus compromisos no podr n asistir a la celebraci n desde todas las canchas del pa s estar n unidos en este mensaje por un m xico seguro
9061172 sobre todo en el trato que se les da antes no eran escuchados
9061173 hoy en d a el luchador independiente me atrevo a decir que puede competir a la par de gente del cmll y de la aaa en todos los sentidos no s lo en el laboral sino tambi n en el sentido que tenemos la misma preparaci n para enfrentar lo mejor que hay en m xico
9061174 quiero crear un concepto diferente en el que el luchador sea completo ll mese a reo t cnico y demostrar que la lucha mexicana de anta o a ras de lona sigue vigente no nada m s la a rea sino que el luchador debe ser completo
9061175 lo que quiere demostrar horus es que el luchador mexicano sigue vigente
9061176 a todos los que quieran entrar en este nuevo concepto de horus
9061177 la estrategia que utilic fue mala y por ello no me alcanz para llegar a finales la preparaci n fue buena pero el plan de trabajo fue el que me llev a la eliminaci n
9061178 estoy tranquilo tras mi trabajo en juegos ol mpicos te repito hubo fallas en la estrategia aunado a que los europeos estuvieron muy bien esto me deja el legado para entrenar mejor para futuras competencias
9061179 la presi n de los medios s me afect porque est s pensando antes de competir en que si no das el resultado todas las cr ticas se te vienen encima pero igual a grandes campeones ol mpicos y mundiales les ha afectado pero creo no debo desanimarme ya que a partir del pr ximo a o hay que sacar la frustraci n
9061180 siempre el ser seleccionado es algo que te pone contento y que aspira a m s cosas las metas se van logrando poco a poco pero uno tiene que seguir trabajando en conseguir otros objetivos y ahora es jugar contra atlante tratar de ganar y luego la eliminatoria que espero jugar y debutar con la selecci n mayor
9061181 que era algo que nunca esper y se me dio la oportunidad de jugar esos partidos
9061182 la eliminatoria es algo que tampoco esper pero de nuevo me est n dando la oportunidad y no hay que desaprovecharla sino seguir adelante
9061183 me est n llegando a m a una corta edad pero no hay que desaprovecharlas sino trabajar y estar en ese buen momento que est viviendo el equipo y tratar de aportar lo que uno pueda
9061184 tomamos el deporte como una forma de rehabilitarnos tratamos que todos los que pasen por el batall n de sanidad se vuelvan deportistas

9061216 the use of torture in israeli interrogations and works for its complete prohibition
9061217 how common is the phenomenon of beating shackled palestinian prisoners
9061218 unfortunately i want to admit something that we are not fully aware of these cases are not all that exceptional in their quantity to my great regret many of them are not the subject of any complaint and are cloaked in various kinds of conspiracies of silence
9061219 moral legal and practical gravity to examine how those responsible address it to clarify its absolute prohibition under israeli and international law and to demand
9061220 by providing the relevant bodies with useful information and tools
9061221 only metal devices are to be used and the tightening of the shackles should be undertaken to prevent injury to the detainee particularly to blood vessels
9061222 i was put in a small room and they beat my legs they put me on the floor then i felt one of the soldiers take something from the floor and beat me on my head and shoulders then they took me out into a concrete yard and tied my handcuffs to a concrete pole and made me sit on the ground and they beat me every hour or half hour they would beat me on the face
9061223 assault identification of explosives scouting weapons and ammunition searches or rescue and release
9061224 neutralize and attack hostile elements seizes a subject and wont let go
9061225 race colour sex language religion political or other opinion national ethnic or social origin property disability birth or other status
9061226 grave consequences of this action can be anticipated in advance
9061227 how can it be that these events keep repeating themselves and no one is bothered and this is the morality of the idf these are the most basic values to which soldiers should be educated from the start it isnt about palestinians its about normative behavior the most basic things how a soldier in the idf can commit such abusive acts it comes down to some kind of disregard for the lives of palestinians
9061228 criminal phenomenon subject to penalties under an entire system of offenses in israeli criminal law
9061229 given this reality it is hardly surprising that an examination of the actual behavior of the military as distinct from its declarations also reveals denial evasion and obfuscation
9061230 when you deny thousands of people a day free movement it is impossible to do it in a nice way
9061231 tangible objectives for securing a drastic reduction in as short a period of time as possible toward the ultimate goal of completely eradicating this phenomenon
9061232 coalition of israeli palestinian and international ngos united against the practice of torture and ill treatment in israel and the occupied palestinian territories opt
9061233 torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
9061234 to various stakeholders in israel and the opt including the eu tel aviv delegation ecd european commission technical assistance office for the west bank and gaza ectao eu ambassadors and or other relevant eu contact persons in eu missions and ngos particularly active in this field
9061235 the eu and its member states contribute to the prevention and eradication of torture
9061236 combat ing impunity to hold perpetrators liable establish ing reporting procedures and provid ing reparation and rehabilitation for victims
9061237 if there is something all humanity can agree on at least theoretically it is that preserving individual dignity in difficult situations requires that we all conform to some elementary common standards of conduct
9061238 there shall be no violation of the life body or dignity of any person all persons are entitled to protection
9061239 there shall be no deprivation or restriction of the liberty of a person by imprisonment arrest extradition or otherwise
9061240 israeli law has abolished the death penalty for murder and corporal punishment
9061241 fundamental human rights founded upon recognition of the value of the human being the sanctity of human life and the principle that all persons are free
9061242 to protect human life dignity and assure that all government authorities are bound to respect these rights under this basic law
9061243 officially proclaimed a state of public emergency from 19 may 1948 four days after its founding until the present day
9061244 due to the ongoing state of war or violent conflict between israel and its neighbours and the attendant attacks on the lives and property of its citizens
9061245 from torture and other forms of ill treatment or punishment may not be violated under any circumstances and states of emergency
9061246 in the context of the arrest and interrogation of persons suspected of being security threats
9061247 israels sensitivity in dealing with human rights issues and the problem of torture and ill treatment makes any dialogue on these matter particularly slow and complex
9061248 may become overly reluctant to raise such issues systematically consistently and firmly notwithstanding their legal and political duty to put human rights in the centre of their foreign and security policy
9061249 apparently not the subject of torture and ill treatment given the political realities in israel and the opt progress in preventing and eradicating torture and ill treatment must be regarded as a mid and long term goal
9061250 there is never a good moment to raise human rights questions and always a reason for not doing something
9061251 strongly and consistently promot ing full compliance with basic and absolute legal obligations to protect individuals most fundamental rights
9061252 financial assistance to civil society actors in israel and the opt

9061281 na primeira parte foi um per odo de estudo do advers rio n o conseguimos parar a movimenta o de silas e cheg mos ao intervalo a perder na segunda parte estivemos bem melhores marc mos dois golos e pod amos ter ganho mas n o aconteceu assim
9061282 sab amos ao intervalo que estando a perder o p ferreira ia atacar mais na segunda parte ficamos condicionados a partir do momento da les o do z pedro foi um momento crucial do jogo at porque o baiano tamb m se lesionou e fomos obrigados a mexer no jogo
9061283 matado o jogo na primeira parte isso n o aconteceu e numa altura como esta em que a equipa ainda n o tem o entrosamento e a confian a ideal o que torna tudo mais dif cil
9061284 estou muito feliz e orgulhoso a equipa jogou muito bem parab ns tamb m ao manchester united que uma grande equipa contudo o zenit jogou bem em todos os sectores do ataque defesa

9061287 the prime ministers legal actions are an attempt to use the courts to interfere with the official oppositions freedom of political expression and thereby give his party an advantage over his principal political opponents
9061288 such an injection of legal action into our political debates were it to succeed would give the government party a political advantage over its opponents

9061302 you can start by stop looking at me that way
9061303 come on you already have me so why are you still thinking that you dont
9061304 i thought it was supposed to be the other way around
9061305 of course its like only the biggest news around at lunch
9061306 they threw out all the stuff from her locker it was really a hilarious sight seeing her scramble to get everything back
9061307 i want to succeed i want to be the miracle
9061308 teria vergonha de dizer se fosse prefeito que tenho dinheiro em caixa com a cidade na situa o que est vamos ter que falar onde est esse dinheiro vamos auditar e se tiver crime contra patrim nio vamos tomar provid ncias n o sei o que vamos encontrar
9061309 hoje vivemos uma gest o autorit ria e isolada a prefeitura n o se relaciona nem com o presidente nem com o governo do estado e nem com a sociedade

9061318 everything that we sell has awnings air conditioner microwaves large refrigerators stabilizer jacks slide out rooms
9061319 our average person will probably be towing with a truck and youre going to be averaging in the low teens
9061320 a couple of dollars a gallon ago we went to yellowstone so it was a pretty good haul across the county this year we scaled back
9061321 were only about 10 miles from our house but it makes us just as happy you meet a lot of new friends and people and you just have a good time
9061322 theyre leaving some of the houses theres not so many in there some of them go back at night then the other ones come down here because its a lighted area lot of insects
9061323 the most important thing is wear gloves do not have direct contact with the bat that defeats the whole point we want to make sure people capture the bat safely and avoid contact with it
9061324 they want to get out once they get in there they want to get out too
9061325 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
9061326 we wanted to make sure they had time to make that transition because finding a new school location is harder than finding a new office location
9061327 we had heard some suggestion that we might have to be moving out fairly quickly then the last time we talked to them the urgency subsided
9061328 i would be kind of surprised investing what they have in it if they knocked it down and didnt get another year or two out of it but that is their call
9061329 although we realize you may have the legal right to terminate their lease in the middle of the school year we are pleading for your compassion and reconsideration
9061330 nothing has changed here there is nothing political about this
9061331 we are now at a point where we are ready to move forward
9061332 this is the community they are building for and they are biting the hand that feeds them
9061333 in the end it is difficult for us to fix this if lennar is eager to develop the property for other uses
9061334 on the other hand if they are showing flexibility we can encourage that
9061335 russia has recognized the independence of we support russia russia is right and is defending its interests
9061336 well uh you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or uh a scientific perspective uh answering that question with specificity uh you know is is uh above my pay grade
9061337 le mot r sister doit toujours se conjuguer au pr sent
9061338 la commission europ enne nous entra ne vers une contamination toujours plus importante par de plus en plus de pesticides dans les aliments les enfants devraient pouvoir manger autant de fruits et de l gumes quils le souhaitent et ce sans risque
9061339 plusieurs centaines de limites maximales en r sidus lmr deviennent d sormais dangereuses pour les consommateurs
9061340 au regard m me des normes danalyse et des m thodes danalyses fix es par lue
9061341 pour chaque pesticide la commission a identifi le pays ayant la plus mauvaise limite de s curit et a adopt ce niveau pour les normes europ ennes
9061342 les consommateurs europ ens vont donc tre moins bien prot g s en tant expos s plus de 200 pesticides diff rents des niveaux importants
9061343 pour un enfant pesant 16 5 kilos la dose de pesticide dangereuse pour la sant est d pass e apr s la consommation de 20 grammes de raisin soit 5 7 grains 40 grammes de pomme ou 50 grammes de prunes
9061344 na pas rempli son obligation de fixer des limites l gales les plus basses possibles
9061345 na pas non plus valu les effets cumulatifs des pesticides sur la sant humaine
9061346 le r glement est fondamentalement vici et doit tre revu durgence
9061347 while we can say that cost of goods is lower from india prices going down is not a good thing for anybody
9061348 volumes are going up but the prices are under pressure
9061349 i think it will take us a year or two to see significant growth and value there
9061350 though its currently being used for our captive needs it has the potential to emerge as a business on its own
9061351 the power sector will grow at 75 80 every year till it reaches a implementation rate of 12 000 mw to 15 000 mw a year
9061352 weather is a very critical component of our industry and people like to drink beer when it is nice and hot we have not had a nice and hot season this year the flood situation in places like bihar and andhra pradesh has not helped either
9061353 we are still growing in the range of 10 12 right now and the reason is probably the weather we are still in august and there is plenty of time for us to recover this year weather permitting our annual growth targets remain at 15
9061354 we will definitely not launch our miller brand in this fiscal we are in the process where we have just started looking into the brand to check it out among consumers etc no plans at all right now
9061355 we have planned some new launches this year but i can not talk about that right now however they are not premium brands
9061356 in the past we have been partnering with large sis on and off but now we are going wholly into this route as it can grow our revenues much faster
9061357 these large firms owing to their size and relationship with it clients have easy access to high level decision makers sometimes they do not sell a service because they are incapable of doing so by partnering with us they can offer our services in their package
9061358 automated testing is less time consuming and comes at premium
9061359 we do the testing process review and then take on testing process improvement
9061360 you are such a spoil sport you woman are impossible
9061361 it is a proven fact that tata tea has moved out of the tea garden business in bengal so the propaganda on part of the company as well state government that the tatas are dedicated to bengal is false
9061362 that those who because of war and totalitarian regimes have been obliged to leave their homes and country be supported by christians in the defense and protection of their rights
9061363 you cant sit children down and start a formal lecture on anything least of all sex
9061364 you dont want to scare them off or embarrass them you have to use the medium they are used to
9061365 parents have to be prepared to give them such information early in life most dont do it because they dont know how to start the key is to shed inhibitions
9061366 we believe it was not akashs mistake he was so confident of flying solo it is surprising that another aircraft collided with akashs we have consulted many experts and their opinion is that it was the fault of the club
9061367 we are awaiting a proper report about the incident we do not have any communication with the australian government we are getting all the news from dilip akashs cousin working in melbourne
9061368 dilip has informed us the body will reach bangalore only after three weeks
9061369 john mccains selection of sarah palin as his running mate will either turn out to be a brilliant way for the republican to scramble the race in his favor or a disastrous pick that is cast as a desperate act
9061370 it is a sweet rice dumpling with a filling of coconut and jaggery called saran
9061371 we make ukadiche steamed rice modak at home i have also tried my hand at making them
9061372 it clearly shows that there was no planning or field studies done before implementing such a massive project which aims to ease our travel woes
9061373 we have been informed through divisional commissioner jammu that the talks would not be possible due to bloerias illness he had a fall in his house and is not in a position to meet people
9061374 bloeria has been advised by doctors to rest for another day talks with the sass will now take place on august 30
9061375 we are also holding a mega rally on sunday in which more than two lakh people are expected
9061376 global economic conditions have worsened with the growth in major advanced economies decelerating and inflation hardening in india headline industrial growth after a sustained expansion that began in 2003 04 moderated from september 2007
9061377 inflation has hardened further even though the pass through of the rise in international crude oil prices remains incomplete finances of the government are under some stress on account of several factors such as increased pressures from oil fertilisers and food subsidies the farm loan waiver scheme and the hike in wages following the implementation of the sixth pay commission
9061378 but i can see on the screen that some one is buying for 43 8250 and someone is selling for 43 8400 i only hope one of them ends up making a profit
9061379 we were clearly disappointed at the events that took place last evening theyre not representative of our expectations for any of our students either athletes or non athletes but clearly were still in the midst of an investigation were hoping to get to the bottom of what happened
9061380 we do this we do that we know whats best for you just ask us
9061381 ego sta n o diria bairrista talvez e o passado deixou te marcas profundas

9061394 today is the 3rd anniversary of hurricane katrinas catastrophic hit on the louisiana mississippi alabama coast unfortunately i think that people living in new orleans should mark the anniversary of katrina by getting the heck out of the city you live at the bottom of a bowl ten or so feet below sea level
9061395 nature wants to fill up this bowl with huge quantities of gulf of mexico sea water there is a storm capable of doing that bearing down on you if you live in new orleans i suggest you take a little labor day holiday sooner rather than later to beat the rush and get out of town gustav is going to come close to you and theres no sense messing with a major hurricane capable of pushing a category 3 storm surge to your doorstep dont test those category 3 rated but untested levees conventional pre katrina wisdom suggested that the city needed 72 hours to evacuate with the population about half of the pre katrina population that lead time is about 60 hours
9061396 with gustav likely to bring tropical storm force winds to the city by monday afternoon that means that tonight is a good time to start evacuating saturday morning at the latest voluntary evacuations have already begun which is a good idea

9061405 if you are fundamentally unhappy with your life you will be more unhappy if you take this job so do us all a favor and get some treatment or move to the rockies but do not apply for employment with us

9061424 as is it is telling you clearly that it wants no further responsibility for the vehicle as soon as you drive it off the lot and if the dealership doesnt want any responsibility for the car what does that tell you about the vehicle

9062306 mccain has chosen to balance his ticket with a principled conservative governor palins life story is one of sticking to principle she is living proof that a person can take on the corrupt political establishment including corrupt leaders in her own party and achieve great things

9062335 that man did things for this country that few people could go through never forget that
9062336 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington

9062351 iniziamo questo campionato non nel modo migliore per le indicazioni che ci arrivano dalla lega
9062352 non so esattamente la condizione della squadra anche perch ero impegnato col calciomercato fuori i mister mi hanno detto che stanno bene ma voci di mercato possono confondere i giocatori
9062353 il vicenza certamente una buona squadra in generale con alcuni reparti particolarmente interessanti e una squadra da temere
9062354 noi abbiamo mantenuto lintelaiatura della scorsa stagione abbiamo dei giocatori importanti e ci faremo rispettare per dobbiamo mantenere i piedi per terra
9062355 io credo che il di costanzo possa fare bene gioca con un modulo molto simile per non dire uguale modulo uguale al precedente a iaconi cui faccio un in bocca al lupo per la prossima stagione comunque abbiamo scelto di costanzo proprio nel segno di una continuit di progetto e modulo
9062356 le tre retrocesse su tutti parma livorno ed empoli poi ci sono bari e mantova ovviamente con il brescia in pi e occhio al frosinone
9062357 guberti un obiettivo di molte squadre ma in realt non ha unofferta valida per quello che ha dimostrato e per il lavoro fatto dallascoli in questi due anni c ancora tempo fino a luned sera io gli auguro di andare in a tutti chiedono ma nessuno affonda posso consigliarlo a qualunque squadra della massima serie
9062358 moreno un calciatore che in questo momento cinteressa ma bisogna vedere
9062359 baronio un giocatore davvero importante ma a oggi non ci sono le condizioni per portarlo con noi
9062360 cioffi unottima perdina e credo si meriti pi spazio vediamo le soluzioni che si prospettano da qui alla fine
9062361 siniscalchi stiamo trattanto la cessione col pescara penso luned si risolver
9062362 e fondamentale per noi non vogliamo cederlo anzi qualora ci fosse la possibilit vorremmo rinnovare il contratto il siena non lo ha richiesto
9062363 il mercato in generale stato disastroso fino a questo momento mi auguro che possa cambiare di passo nelle prossime ore
9062364 giusto che la b abbia pi visibilit necessario che si abbia pi visibilit anche perch la b propone calciatori interessanti anche per la massima serie
9062365 c stato qualche contatto ora stanno parlando con il mio procuratore
9062366 sono soddisfatto perch in questo momento della stagione non bisogna guardare il risultato ma la prestazione e questa stata ottima abbiamo lottato per 90 nonostante la condizione non sia delle migliori sono arrabbiato solo perch i miei giocatori erano delusi alla fine il migliore in campo stato agliardi e basha ha trovato il gol della domenica paloschi ha dimostrato buone qualit su quelle non avevamo dubbi
9062367 sono venuto qui perch voglio che parma sia il mio trampolino di lancio e sogno di tornare in a con questa maglia la mia prestazione stata un p come quella della squadra siamo andati bene ma siamo stati sfortunati specie io su quel gol mancato con cristiano lucarelli mi trovo a meraviglia lui la boa io gli giro attorno
9062368 sapevamo che il debutto sarebbe stato duro la serie b cos ora dobbiamo dimostrare la nostra voglia siamo pronti a tutto se ho discusso con cagni durante il primo tempo io non ho visto nessuna discussione penso a giocare e basta e sono il primo a dare sempre il massimo
9062369 abbiamo ottenuto un grande risultato contro una grande squadra se il mio debutto in serie b stato cos buono lo devo solo e soltanto a dei ragazzi meravigliosi che mi stanno seguendo in tutto e per tutto oggi poi abbiamo giocato con sottil che aveva provato poco e milone che era sotto antibiotici per questo ho fatto dei cambi nella ripresa
9062370 elo the term electronic literature refers to works with important literary aspects that take advantage of the capabilities and contexts provided by the stand alone or networked computer
9062371 i personally dont have the attention economy to read a 250 page crime novel from start to finish
9062372 i realized that the way id like to consume a novel is to be rewarded every couple of chapters by seeing something visual that enhances the narrative

9062377 the results of the stock assessment spell out the need for very aggressive management
9062378 were going to destroy a whole fishing community based on these numbers to what degree do we feel these numbers are good numbers
9062379 were seeing winter losses rising its no good blaming it all on the weather and its certainly not appropriate to blame it on bad beekeeping theres something going on here in the hives that we dont understand and we should therefore research it really in the context of government expenditure the money were asking for is really small change we cannot afford to take these risks
9062380 by christmas there will be no english honey in the supermarkets im absolutely sure because were just not getting the honey in from the beekeepers so we will have to import more in from abroad thats tragic imagine if that were a permanent scenario if there are no british honeybees therell be no british honey on the shelves
9062381 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect

9062386 maybe the big scary piece of paper will get bored sprout legs and walk away if i dont look directly at it
9062387 this also impacts sports and social clubs its very much the fabric of the high street and the way we socialise and we lose that at our peril
9062388 we know that the kids who are out there getting drunk and getting involved in crime or ending up in accident and emergency are unlikely to be drinking in pubs chances are they have been tanked up on cut price alcohol
9062389 when alcoholic drinks are being sold at a price below water we are in a really bad place
9062390 in that zone you find disorder litter and threatening behaviour that is stimulated by cheap alcohol
9062391 its ridiculous to suggest that supermarkets are selling any significant proportion of alcohol at a loss no business could survive and certainly not thrive if they were doing that
9062392 we just have to try and make pubs more attractive

9062400 i am absolutely delighted by this selection once again john mccain has shown that he is an independent thinker who paints in bold strokes sarah palin is a conservative reformer with executive experience who will bring a breath of fresh air to washington she will be an ideal running mate for john mccain and will make a major contribution to our countrys future

9062414 lets suppose that that phone rings at 3am in the morning and either joe biden or sarah palin has to answer it you tell me
9062415 after this pick ask yourself again who has the better judgment john mccain or barack obama
9062416 nahm jesus brot segnete brach und gab es den j ngern und sprach nehmt esst dies ist mein leib
9062417 weil sein leib noch nicht am kreuz hingegeben war ist es eindeutig dass er hier sinnbildlich spricht er benutzt das brot als symbol seines leibes

9062424 we do this we do that we know whats best for you just ask us
9062425 we remind the company that having set an example with mike carlton it may need to sack all the undersigned if it insists on this course of action
9062426 we believe the company hires columnists on the basis that they have principles it is wrong to sack them for the same reason
9062427 mike is not a member of the sydney morning herald staff
9062428 its not a half decent product its a very decent product its as normal
9062429 well reserve our rights on all of that and well make decisions as things evolve
9062430 not the hard news not the international news not the business sport local news that is not the part of the business that is being affected at all
9062431 its really quite mischievous of people to say that theres going to be a decline in the quality
9062432 so when everyone was telling me that i had to release my single on itunes because they own the market and thats just what youve gotta do these days i decided that i wasnt going to do it
9062433 this is an incredible achievement when you consider kate walsh is unsigned and still outsold several major international artists
9062434 the record labels are queuing up to sign her now
9062435 theyre bloogers on steroids and they act like an internet news machine

9062448 it was like being in new york city with one of the
9062449 people were stopping in the streets and climbing up things to see him they were going nuts hes like a superstar
9062450 for americas kids the time to play and swim is today
9062451 we need everyones help in providing all kids with safe and well equipped spaces where they can exercise have fun and maybe even begin to pursue their own olympic dreams
9062452 from the look on his face being in that pool was the highlight of his day all the stress just melted away
9062453 the big problems are right below the canyons weve had a couple of canyons burn all the way up
9062454 were looking at homes below those canyons we are looking at the creek flows or potential degree flow would go so well look at those areas
9062455 uh oh here we go because we have already had the drama of the fire so we actually have our landscapers out here trying to do some stuff that will hopefully prevent for whats going to come for us
9062456 we want to stay safe so we are planning on going to the meeting and finding out what we can do to recognize the signs of a flood a mudslide to see what we can do to make our houses more defensible
9062457 i mean when the vegetation is gone like that it doesnt have to necessarily be the mud rock and silt i mean we will probably get some of that but we are also worried about just natural water shedding off of there and just having natural flooding in that area
9062458 we were all invited to a special week long trip to do photo and video shoots in eleuthera in the bahamas
9062459 the councilman said another car belonged to an assistants family member
9062460 the joke has always been that texas wont try anything new until after losing to oklahoma
9062461 just more than a day remains until we learn if howard schnellenberger was right about the texas football team being softer than the nba salary cap
9062462 ryan bailey will not only keep his job and should come on mack show him some love after beating nebraska and oklahoma state he will nail field goals on 21 of 25 tries
9062463 the longhorns will be slightly worse on offense than a year ago much better on defense than a year ago and play harder in 08
9062464 the only first team all american will be defensive end brian orakpo after his 13 sack year
9062465 the court is well aware that there are real risks to the class associated with the settlement that it finally approves today
9062466 however like the parties the court has evaluated these risks in light of the even greater risks of not settling this dispute
9062467 we are pleased the u s district court today approved the ford veba trust which is an important step in improving our competitiveness and is key to our ongoing transformation
9062468 its basically taking obamas speech not off television and off radio but it certainly has neutralized it a lot
9062469 clinton said it well herself i dont see how anyone who was for sen clinton and what she represents could switch to the republic party and mccain and bush and gov palin
9062470 its political hes doing what he needs to do to get elected
9062471 it brings it back i feel for them because ive been there right after he did it to me he killed a girl it was scary he had me at knifepoint
9062472 one of the women ended up hitting one of them in the head with a gun luckily she wasnt seriously injured
9062473 im going to make sure they are locked keep the windows locked and make sure i have some kind of protection i can grab
9062474 bottom line this guy is out there in pine bluff we believe he robbed and sexually assaulted two women this morning you should be on the lookout
9062475 i think this says that america in the 21st century is much different than america in the 20th century
9062476 are now being realized in all areas of american life even the highest levels of elective office the presidency and vice presidency
9062477 the pipeline of potential national candidates is up and gubernatorial candidates are up
9062478 my biggest concern with the income data is that were getting off to a weak start to the third quarter
9062479 the income numbers are a reminder that the economy is going to look worse before it gets better
9062480 traditionally september is a weak month for stocks and i dont think were going to escape that
9062481 i do think we are going to stay in a trading range i dont see this market falling out of bed and going below the july lows
9062482 estuve bien pero mi salida no fue tan buena estaba totalmente concentrado en ganar y no pensaba en ning n tiempo muy r pido
9062483 this finding suggests an urgent situation in which the largest numbers of transferred youths in need of psychiatric services are also the least likely to receive them
9062484 y no lo hicieron por eso en el momento en que decidimos aumentar las tarifas es porque tenemos el fundamento legal
9062485 estoy dispuesto a cumplir la ley siempre y cuando tengan los argumentos legales a su alcance
9062486 cataract is something that most of us will develop at some point in our lives the key is to understand what we can do now to help protect our vision in the future
9062487 humans frequently invoke an argument that their intuition can result in a better decision than conscious reasoning such assertions may rely on subconscious associative learning
9062488 even without conscious processing of contextual cues our brain can learn their reward value and use them to provide a bias on decision making
9062489 i think it would have been very very difficult if not impossible to reschedule this game
9062490 i think the governor did a tremendous job of listening to all of his advisors and we all came to a consensus agreement that we could play this game albeit we need to play early to allow for the safety of our citizens in a traffic flow
9062491 now that we have an accurate way to count these cells we are able to confirm what we long suspected that blacks might have a bigger army of hla specific b cells
9062492 if the recipient is not sensitized b cells represent only a patients potential for making antibodies
9062493 however about a third of patients in need of a kidney are sensitized since theyre often on their second or third transplantation and may have undergone transfusions
9062494 knowing that blacks have an increased number of hla specific b cells which increases their opportunity for antibody mediated rejection we may be able to customize treatments for black recipients to account for these differences and lessen the likelihood that the organ will be rejected
9062495 cataract is something that most of us will develop at some point in our lives the key is to understand what we can do now to help protect our vision in the future
9062496 unfortunately many people feel the need to manually remove earwax called cerumen which serves an important protective function for the ear
9062497 cotton swabs and some other home remedies can push cerumen further into the canal potentially foiling the natural removal process and instead cause build up known as impaction
9062498 when cerumen builds to the point of causing symptoms such as pain ringing itching or hearing problems its a sign you should see a physician
9062499 the complications from cerumen impaction can be painful and include infections and hearing loss
9062500 it is hoped that these guidelines will give clinicians the tools they need to spot an issue early and avoid serious outcomes
9062501 we may have a little way to go but thats not bad
9062502 vaccines are probably one of the top two or three public health interventions of all time
9062503 they now have been so successful they suffer from their success because people dont see the diseases and the horrors associated with them
9062504 you get something called herd immunity although i wish there were a better name for it
9062505 if you get enough people vaccinated even people who arent vaccinated are protected because the disease cant transmit the virus cant get past the wall of vaccinated people weve created
9062506 several vaccines for that age group just kind of came up
9062507 the issue is explaining the vaccine at a time when neither the child nor the parent want to think about this when the girl is still preteen
9062508 i say this is to prevent cervical cancer and you have to receive it before youre infected
9062509 theres not the same push if youre not going to college so they dont think about it
9062510 i think eventually it will be universally recommended for everyone every year
9062511 we need to do a better job at immunizing people against flu
9062512 everyone over 50 should get one and so should kids because were discovering theyre the reservoir for flu theyre in a closed container called school so they transmit it easily between themselves and then they bring that little present home
9062513 if my patients come in for a routine visit or a sick visit ill look at their immunization record
9062514 youre not going to get that so much if youre bouncing around from provider to provider because theyre not going to have the record
9062515 the evidence is becoming clearer every day that vaccines do not cause autism but there are some very stubborn groups out there who still make that claim
9062516 you can not cuz we said so install macos x on that gray box

9062560 were going down off roading with our jeeps and instead of towing were packing up the jeep and stuck driving it ourselves
9062561 instead of having that insurance policy being able to tow it home its kind of a risk but its cheaper
9062562 not just gas prices but all the extra fees that people are having to pay now
9062563 whether its for extra baggage if you want food or drink on the plane i think all of those things are really factoring in peoples decisions they are looking at those things very closely when they are deciding where they are going on vacation and when theyre going to go
9062564 were headed to the next adventure out on the plains of meridiani
9062565 we safely got into the crater we completed our exploration there and we safely got out
9062566 we were concerned that any wheel failure on our aging rover could have left us trapped inside the crater
9062567 we realized we had to take immediate action because of the potential threat to human life and destruction that was possible
9062568 none of the materials are unusual they can all be purchased at hardware store its the combination of these materials that can cause problems

9062578 senator obama on this same topic what about your view on the decision on partial birth abortion and your reaction to most of the public agreeing with the courts holding
9062579 i trust women to make these decisions in conjunction with their doctors and their families and their clergy
9062580 to appreciate that all you need to do is review the recent decision handed down by the supreme court of the united states for the first time in gonzales versus carhart the supreme court upheld a federal ban on abortions with criminal penalties for doctors for the first time the court endorsed an abortion restriction without an exception for womens health the decision presumed that the health of women is best protected by the court not by doctors and not by the woman herself that presumption is wrong
9062581 in 2001 when obama was an illinois state senator he and his colleagues considered a bill called the born alive infant protection act which provided that a live child born as a result of abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law it came up for a vote twice in the state legislature the first time obama voted present the second time he voted no
9062582 one of the most odious things that i have ever heard of
9062583 i also think that we should do everything that we can and one of those in my view is respect for human life both born and the unborn its one of the big differences between myself and senator obama who voted against as a member of the illinois state legislature in the judiciary committee voted against a ban on partial birth abortions one of the most odious things that i have ever heard of
9062584 do you support parent consent notification for minors seeking abortion
9062585 the american people have come together to say that partial birth abortion offends our national conscience that taxpayers should not be forced to pay for elective abortions and that states should be allowed to enact parental notification laws
9062586 i support repealing the defense of marriage act i oppose the divisive and discriminatory efforts to amend the california constitution and similar efforts to amend the u s constitution or those of other states
9062587 the divisive and discriminatory efforts to amend the california constitution
9062588 does it bother you what california has done the california supreme courts legalization
9062589 barack has made crystal clear his commitment to ensuring full equality for lgbt couples thats why he opposes all divisive and discriminatory constitutional amendments whether its a proposed amendment to the california and florida constitutions or the u s constitution
9062590 i support the efforts of the people of california to recognize marriage as a unique institution between a man and a woman just as we did in my home state of arizona i do not believe judges should be making these decisions
9062591 i believe that the institution of marriage should be reserved for the union of one man and one woman
9062592 gay rights have been hotly debated here in new england for example last year some parents of second graders in lexington massachusetts were outraged to learn their childrens teacher had read a story about same sex marriage about a prince who marries another prince would you be comfortable having this story being read to your children as part to their school curriculum im going to start with senator edwards
9062593 i think that weve proven that both parents are important in the success of a family so no i dont believe in gay adoption
9062594 senator obama had declined to do that we had filed an amicus brief along with 54 other senators so i was pleased with that ruling
9062595 when i first ran for congress in 1982 i was proud was most proud to have the support of gun owners for more than two decades ive opposed efforts to ban guns ban ammunition ban magazines and dismiss gun owners as some kind of fringe group unwelcome in modern america the 2nd amendment isnt some archaic custom that matters only to rural americas who find solace in firearms out of frustration with their economic circumstances the 2nd amendment is unique in the world it guarantees an individual right to keep and bear arms and to argue anything else is to reject the clear meaning of our founding fathers
9062596 but its those five percent of the cases that really count and in those five percent of the cases what youve got to look at is what is in the justices heart whats their broader vision of what america should be justice roberts said he saw himself just as an umpire but the issues that come before the court are not sport theyre life and death and we need somebody whos got the heart the empathy to recognize what its like to be a young teenage mom the empathy to understand what its like to be poor or african american or gay or disabled or old and thats the criteria by which ill be selecting my judges alright
9062597 always hanging in the air over these tense confirmation battles is the suspicion that maybe just maybe a nominee for the court will dare to remain faithful to the clear intentions of the framers and do the actual meaning of the constitution i will look for accomplished men and women with a proven record of excellence in the law and a proven commitment to judicial restraint i will look for people in the cast of john roberts samuel alito and my friend the late william rehnquist jurists of the highest caliber who know their own minds know the law and know the difference
9062598 when any interest goes to court its in the hands of the judiciary but the judiciary and this is why judicial appointments are so important in my view should strictly interpret laws made by the congress and along with strictly interpreting based on a strict interpretation of the constitution of the united states
9062599 my record is very clear i have never voted for a tax increase in 24 years that should be sufficient time
9062600 harleys been around along time and ive been along for 43 years and ive been on a bike
9062601 this is the first time in 40 some years theyve done some engineering
9062602 we work very hard at utilizing a lot of our heritage and traditional looks at marrying that with new technology

9062606 like other first spouses around the country palin has been asked to champion an array of causes or institutions since his wife took office in december his favorite is steering young alaskans toward jobs in the oil and gas industry
9062607 other studies have suggested that there are differences between men and women in response to different antidepressants but the evidence has been conflicting
9062608 this study is large enough and we were able to control for enough complicating factors that we feel confident there is a true difference these results have clear implications for the clinical treatment of depression
9062609 crewmen dashed here and there attending to one detail and another
9062610 nobody called it a day and went home the job was to get the machines going and make some paper

9062612 value creation entrepreneurship experimental discovery waste elimination and rewarding employees for their contributions
9062613 we have always run fairly lean and we have already endured a few streamlining efforts to stay competitive
9062614 our employees are used to the challenges they have always risen to those challenges in the past and they have again done an outstanding job
9062615 for their dedication and hard work to strengthen the toledo mill for the future

9062617 well see if the notices go out and well act accordingly
9062618 in case of war redzikowo and slupsk will be more secure than other places and not less secure
9062619 you condemned redzikowo and slupsk to annihilation like hiroshima and nagasaki
9062620 from the point of view of polands interests we will be strategically more secure
9062621 i am the last person to seek conflict with our neighbors but as prime minister i must not leave poland defenseless
9062622 can you deny that having the shield base redzikowo will be target no 1 for countries that dont agree with it

9062627 many people said that about her in terms of being governor and i think shes done an excellent job
9062628 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9062629 in this very competitive election for them to go pick somebody who is under a cloud of suspicion who is under investigation for abuse of power it just sounds like a pretty slow start to me
9062630 we need a vice president who can step in if god forbid something happened to john mccain
9062631 i dont think shes someone who is ready for that 3 a m phone call
9062632 gov palin has proven herself as a bright energetic leader for our state and will bring the same energy to the vice presidency she will serve our country with distinction the first alaskan and first woman on the republican ticket i share in the pride of all alaskans
9062633 i think its a great opportunity for the state of alaska
9062634 for us to get our message out in what the satae has to offer to the nation
9062635 a mixed set of emotions kind of an odd sense of alaska nationalism or pride
9062636 this is like watching a moon landing or something its just something you dont expect to see very often its wonderful
9062637 it was an emotional thing to see the governor walk out with her family and i say wow i work for her

9062641 amyloid beta measurements in the brain may turn out to be a good indicator of how well the cells are communicating with each other
9062642 i am torn between grief of losing a child and the thought of explaining to the other woman how her child died if its hers
9062643 i cannot even mourn the babys death because i am not sure she if she was mine
9062644 none of us can provide a cast iron guarantee that salmonella saintpaul will not re emerge
9062645 is an important indication that this particular outbreak is over
9062646 we continue to believe that association could reflect real contamination early on
9062647 it is information that is more restricted in time and does not have confirmatory laboratory findings behind it
9062648 children use the internet and their mobile phones to send harmful messages which marginalise children and can have devastating consequences
9062649 as with bullying cyber bullying can lead to social isolations for those effected by it to a point where they can feel at the edge of their social network and at the very worse of cases at the edge of life
9062650 there is no justification for any violence against a child under an circumstances or at any time
9062651 its 8 million worth of taxpayers money and 14 months too late
9062652 why the afp couldnt have come to this conclusion around the same time as the queensland police service and around the same time as asio we dont know
9062653 were now calling on the government to expand its terms of reference of the clarke inquiry because there are serious questions as to why the afp has continued to call our client a suspect over the course of the last 14 months when asio the queensland police service all concluded that there was not basis for that description
9062654 the explanation needs to say how this could have become such a damaging episode not just for dr haneef but for this nation
9062655 the population largely indifferent to these issues for generations are now all of a sudden realizing they have to do homework on their banks
9062656 it is interesting to see how consumers react because they are still waking up to this and banks really have to hammer home their capital position
9062657 progress continues and we are now planning to submit the environmental impact assessment report and application once there is greater clarity on carbon dioxide regulations and we are able to better align our project with the timing of our potential customers
9062658 we will be reaching out to the provincial government and regulators to discuss some of our concerns
9062659 this just gives us more options just to figure out what is the best thing to meet our potential customers needs
9062660 it appears chicken is still being used as a political tool
9062661 we felt it was important to assume both insured and uninsured deposits and we believe it is our responsibility as a leading national institution to work with and support the fdic in providing safe harbors for depositors in this challenging time
9062662 despite todays announcement it is important to emphasize that the overwhelming majority of banks operating in georgia 96 percent are well capitalized and have adequate reserves
9062663 the population largely indifferent to these issues for generations are now all of a sudden realizing they have to do homework on their banks
9062664 it is interesting to see how consumers react because they are still waking up to this and banks really have to hammer home their capital position
9062665 consumers pulled back on real spending in both june and july in the face of weak employment conditions higher energy prices and further declines in household net worth

9062684 they can just come in here and practice and do their thing
9062685 i think they were just looking for a little bit more of an intimate environment
9062686 while i understand that we didnt really have a lot to offer that many teams would want im sure that something that he couldve done to snag this guy
9062687 unless dantoni lets the leash off marbury and lets him play his game
9062688 players will report to training camp sept 30 and will work out twice a day practices will be closed to the public
9062689 people seem to forget that when marbury is scoring it makes it harder for people to double curry marbury does make the rest of the team better when hes scoring because hes a threat and he breaks down the d with his penetration which creates open shots for others
9062690 we re hearing there s been some chatter about a zach randolph to cleveland scenario inside nba circles

9062701 there is no way youre passing up one last labor day weekend getaway to the beach house in margate to see coastal carolina
9062702 success without honor is like an unseasoned dish it will fill you up but it wont taste good
9062703 we had the mentality that other teams got in three extra weeks of work so we had to catch up
9062704 regardless of whether we brought everyone back from last years team its still a different team
9062705 were building that right now i dont see anyone complacent or sitting on the fact we were super bowl champions last year
9062706 stray was kind of the face but a p was the leader every day at training camp
9062707 he has always been a vocal leader we have plenty of veteran guys stray left an imprint for sure even without him i am still going to envision him stomping someone out before every game
9062708 you have to move forward and you cant dwell on it
9062709 with the predictions and the opinions we could really care less those are the same people that last year told us we wouldnt do nothing
9062710 i think from a mental standpoint guys are even more focused than they were last year and ready to get off to a fast start
9062711 we just have to work hard on that and just be consistent week in and week out
9062712 i think that has been our motivation and we know we have to do that

9062717 youll get a reluctant glimpse into that dark place in my psyche that just cant get enough of peugeots
9062718 if i truly like all of the crap ive been foisting upon you is there
9062719 if this were a 1973 monte carlo which its not instead of the 1992 volvo wagon that we have i would right now be looking at a dashboard rendered entirely in matte black
9062720 a bold and historic move for the republican party that clearly targets women and conservative voters but does little to change the fact that mccains bush like policies would be disastrous for all americans especially women
9062721 put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9062722 it is fitting that this trust has been given to me almost 88 years to the day after the women of america first gained the right to vote
9062723 it turns out the women of america are not finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9062724 as the mother of one of those troops and as commander in chief of alaskas national guard
9062725 the kind of man i want as our commander in chief
9062726 this would be a pretty shrewd pick but one not without risk

9062728 the person im about to introduce to you was a union member and is married to a union member and understands the problems the hopes and the values of working people knows what its like to worry about mortgage payments and health care and the cost of gasoline and groceries
9062729 shes fought oil companies and party bosses and do nothing bureaucrats and anyone who puts their interests before the interests of the people she swore an oath to serve
9062730 shes exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9062731 shes an nra national rifle association lifetime member shes a right to life feminist she has every credential as a conservative she is young shes exciting shes a mom with five kids
9062732 the huge gamble is that john mccain is 72 hes had a couple of bouts with cancer

9062845 creative people have always had enormous power to enlighten and bring about change the knock against classical music is that it has lost touch with the real this festival allows artists to perform music as a living thing not isolate it as an exhibit in a museum
9062846 we want to strike a balance between experimentation and pushing things to another level and remaining respectful of what the audience wants
9062847 but the world is changing fast and the must change with it

9062854 there is a lot of opportunity and hopefully it will be run like a business but will take into account people who cant afford to pay much such as the elderly the idea is to generate enough funds to maintain the systems if they need any repairs and to pay a salary to those doing the work
9062855 after three years and seven months i got to see my home island and i was so happy to be there it looks so different from before
9062856 i am proud that we will have a bigger school better facilities and i hope good teachers too i had the honor of participating in the ceremony and it felt so good its the first time in my life that i had an opportunity like this

9062882 unless its a condition of their parole or probation there are no limits to where a sex offender can live so its up to each municipality to come up with their own laws id like to see it go right through the state
9062883 if they dont have a law passed they can come in in a car and park near a school if there is no law and watch the children and do what they want
9062884 we have a security system for our building anyone coming in must prove who they are and have id with them their name has to be on all the childrens paperwork
9062885 theres no state law and all the laws have not been challenged in court we dont know how the courts will rule but so far of the challenges brought the laws have been upheld so far it appears that the laws are constitutional
9062886 one or the other has to be on a cart to go from one class to class so you either have an art teacher carrying paints and paper or you have the music teacher carrying the bongo drums and the amplification systems
9062887 most of our classrooms have only one or two electrical outlets you cant turn on the microwave at the same time as the copy machine because if you do youll blow the fuses
9062888 we need to invest in our schools but i think we need to do it in a way that people can afford
9062889 were losing money all over the place and i think people are worried about their jobs and this is somewhat out of touch with economic reality

9062900 this is the first charge i believe that we have filed in the united states district court in vermont
9062901 the goal of that is to make more uniform the reporting requirements throughout the united states for sex offenders
9062902 its certainly i think a good idea to have a national standard as to sex offender registries
9062903 i think we have an obligation to do our best to make sure that vermonters who have moved are compliant with the sex offender registry in the state they have moved to to make sure that they told us the truth you know they do lie
9062904 kmart plaza is a classic example of a large polluting site that has poor controls or no controls and is under no legal obligations right now and this decision says your moment of accountability has arrived
9062905 and i hope they will work quickly to define those responsibilities
9062906 its been many many years that taxpayer dollars have been spent fighting this ultimate decision instead of working on cleanup so the state now has the obligation once they notify these polluters of their requirement to get permits and define what the requirements under those permits are

9062911 it seems unlikely that by simply counting words it is possible to differentiate between authors while a particular author may have a core or base vocabulary as well as an affinity for certain words or combination collocation of words there are many factors for instance age further education social setting rhetorical purpose and so on that restrict or expand this core set of lexical items in spite of this new testament attribution studies and many commentaries sadly some rather recent ones at that have placed considerable weight on counting the number of words found in one letter but not found in a group of letters assumed to be authentic
9062912 this quarantine is designed to keep the moths from moving out of the area

9062914 abraham was also commanded to circumcise his sons before they even had the opportunity to exercise faith cf gen 17 12 in much the same way baptism is rightly applied to adult converts after they profess faith and rightly applied to their children even though these same children may not be capable of faith

9062924 presence of indian merchants at hormuz and very friendly and cordial relations between them and arab muslims
9062925 there is no country in india more safe from robbers
9062926 these records make an interesting study primarily because they were set up in gujarat at a time when it had still resisted muslim authority that the muslims inhabited quite a few cities especially in the coastal line of gujarat quite long before its final subjugation by them is an established fact the accounts of arab travellers like masudi istakhari ibn hauqal and others who visited gujarat during the ninth and tenth centuries of the christian era amply testify to the settlements of muslims in various towns and cities the inscriptions studied below also tend to corroborate the fact that the muslims had continued to inhabit gujarat until it became a part of the muslim empire of delhi moreover they furnish rare data for an appraisal of the condition of muslims under non muslim rulers of gujarat on one hand they indicate the extent of permeation of islamic influence in gujarat at a time when it was still ruled by its own rajput princes and show that muslims had long penetrated into different parts of gujarat where they lived as merchants traders sea men missionaries etc these settlements were not only on the coastal regions but also in the interior as is indicated by some of these records on the other hand these epigraphs form a concrete and ever living proof of the tolerance and consideration shown vis a vis their muslim subjects by hindu kings who were no doubt profited by the trade and commerce carried on by these foreign settlers
9062927 ship owner nurud din piruz son of ship owner khwaja abu ibrahim a native of hormuz had come for business to the town of god somnath during the reign of arjunadeva the vaghela king of gujarat c 1261 74 when amir ruknud din was the ruling chief of hormuz piruz purchased a piece of land situated in the sikottari mahayanpal outside the town of somnath in the presence of the leading men like thakkur sri palugideva ranak sri somesvaradeva thakkur sri ramdeva thakkur sri bhimsiha and others and in the presence of all muslim congregations from rajakula sri chhada son of rajakula sri nanasiha piruz who by his alliance with the great man rajakula sri chhada had become his associate in meritorious work caused a mosque to be constructed on that piece of land for its maintenance i e for the expenses of oil for lamp water preceptor crier to prayers and a monthly reader of the quran and also for the payment of expenses of the particular religious festivals according to the custom of sailors as well as for the annual white washing and repairs of rents and defects in the building the said piruz bequeathed three sources of income firstly a palladika particulars regarding whose location and the owner are given in detail secondly a danapala belonging to one oil mill and thirdly two shops in front of the mosque purchased from kilhanadeva lunasiha asadhar and others piruz also laid down that after meeting the expenses as indicated above the surplus income should be sent to the holy cities of mecca and medina as regards the management he desired that the various classes of muslims such as the communities of sailors ship owners the clergy the artisans etc should look after the source of income and properly maintain the mosque
9062928 the arabic inscription does not give all the details regarding the sources of income the procedure for its expenditure management etc which are mentioned at some length in the sanskrit record also the arabic version mentions only the leader of prayer imam caller to prayers muaddhin and the cities of mecca and medina among the beneficiaries likewise no mention is made of the provision for the celebration of religious festivals as stated in the sanskrit record further in the extant portion of the arabic record we do not find mention of the then vaghela king of gujarat arjunadeva on the other hand the arabic version gives some more information regarding the status and position of piruz firuz and his father abu ibrahim for example firuz is called therein the great and respected chief sadr prince among sea men and king of kings and merchants he is further eulogised as the sun of islam and muslims patron of kings and monarchs shelter of the great and the elite pride of the age etc likewise his father abu ibrahim son of muhammad al iraqi is also mentioned with such lofty titles as the great chief of fortunate position protector of islam and the muslims patron of kings and monarchs prince among great men of the time master of generosity and magnanimity etc needless to say all these titles are absent in the sanskrit version
9062929 may his affair and prestige be high in the city of somnat may allah make it one of the cities of islam and banish infidelity and idols
9062930 this is the only record at patan which is dated in the pre muslim period of gujarat furnishing evidence of the settlement or at least presence of muslims in the very capital of the rajput rulers
9062931 whoever disbelieves in the communications of allah then surely allah is quick in reckoning
9062932 may be taken to suggest that abul qasim probably an influential merchant conducting business in that part was associated in some way with the liaison work between the state and its muslim population the record also indicates that there was a considerable number of muslim population residing at junagadh which necessitated the building of a prayer house and that some of the saurashtra ports used to clear the traffic of haj pilgrims from gujarat and possibly from outside too

9063042 if my conjecture is confirmed then it raises the suspicion that someone in the united states deliberately created this conflict in order to worsen the situation and create an advantage for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
9063043 and if this is a fact it is nothing other than the use of so called administrative resources in a domestic political struggle and in the worst bloodiest form as well

9063072 the governors veto does not signal any change or modification to her disagreement with the action and order by the alaska supreme court it is the governors intention to work with the legislature and to give the people of alaska an opportunity to express their wishes and intentions whether these benefits should continue
9063073 we may disagree with the rationale behind the ruling but our responsibility is to proceed forward with the law and follow the constitution i disagree with the recent court decision because i feel as though alaskans spoke on this issue with its overwhelming support for a constitutional amendment in 1998 which defined marriage as between a man and woman but the supreme court has spoken and the state will abide

9063098 this is senator mccains first significant choice in building his executive team and its a bad one it has to raise serious doubts in the minds of voters about john mccains commitment to conservation to addressing the impacts of global warming and to ensuring our country ends its dependency on oil

9063150 governor corzine has promised to renew open space funding on several occasions but he has yet to deliver
9063151 today we are calling on the governor to keep his promise and keep new jersey green
9063152 at the shore today the blue skies are the green skies
9063153 this banner will remind citizens that there is important work that remains to be completed and they need to hold their elected officials accountable
9063154 with the help of green acres matching grant funds and private contributors the nature conservancy has created 37 nature preserves in new jersey encompassing over 21 000 acres which are available for public enjoyment
9063155 however with the end of green acres funds on the horizon we and many other conservation organizations counties and municipalities will have to curtail preservation activities and areas important to the preservation of wildlife and water supplies will be lost to development
9063156 this state can not afford to take a giant step backward in our preservation efforts
9063157 our citizens must call on their elected officials to renew funds for open space and farmland preservation before it is too late
9063158 in this tight economy preserving new jerseys open spaces is the smartest investment we can make
9063159 open spaces protect our drinking water provide free and healthy places for families to explore and shelter natures wild places new jersey is the most densely populated state in our great nation and the time to save our last remaining open spaces is now
9063160 soon it will be too late to preserve what little open space we still have as we march toward build out and real estate values rebound sky high this is why we have this plane in the sky the governor needs to fulfill his repeatedly broken promise to do so
9063161 governor corzine has let the garden state trust fund run dry and we need him to immediately act to replenish its funding every month that goes by with no funding for open space will mean more permanent loss of green space that is so critical to new jerseys quality of life with only 15 years left before new jersey reaches full build out we cannot wait gspt funds must be renewed this fall
9063162 new jerseys commitment to the protection of the highlands and the water supply the region provides is not complete without a fully funded garden state preservation trust the highlands are at risk if we cant preserve these lands forever on behalf of the public
9063163 the new jersey historic trusts grants programs will soon end without renewed and stable funding
9063164 historic places that give our communities character are at risk and the opportunities for community revitalization and renewal that would be lost will only encourage more loss of open space and farmland more sprawl and unsustainable development
9063165 new jersey was once known as the leader in open space preservation with many thousands of acres preserved and a storied history of close to half a century noted stiles
9063166 where once new jersey was a leader it will soon become a laggard as the state draws ever closer to the first break in annual open space acquisition funding in over two decades this historic lack of funding will devastate open space preservation and thousands of acres of land could be forever lost to development
9063167 as new jerseyans enjoy the states many outstanding beaches and parks with their families over labor day weekend we hope theyll take a minute to let the governor know that we cant afford to let funds run out for preservation efforts that are critical to protecting clean water and providing parks for people to enjoy
9063168 crawling to freedom through five hundred yards of shit smelling foulness i cant even imagine
9063169 that which is hateful to you do not do to another the rest of the torah is all commentary now go study
9063170 audio panton cogito singularis listen to everything think for yourself
9063171 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination passions fly on immigration but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers this too is part of americas promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
9063172 in an overlapping consensus citizens support the same basic laws for different reasons
9063173 he generally views the poor as helpless victims rather than as people with the capacity to act on their own behalf to bring about change he may think hes the crusading journalist exposing injustice but hes really a cynic who takes pity on the poor yet cant imagine a world where things could be different
9063174 gt red cross chapter service associate lisa sellin is leaving sunday morning for baton rouge la to help with evacuees from the gulf coast from hurricane gustav
9063175 my assumption is that they will be evacuating people down along the gulf coast
9063176 it will be more difficult to mobilize people once the storm has hit
9063177 its kind of a culmination of all the training we get to put things in place and use things that weve learned
9063178 anyone who wants to do volunteer work with us the volunteer training we give locally is applicable to national disasters
9063179 i was honored to have had the opportunity to thoroughly explore the presidency there
9063180 the board was pleased with the candidates that were forwarded to it however due to the caliber of the final candidates the board had difficulty reaching a consensus on one candidate
9063181 the board is confident that old dominion will maintain its forward trajectory and continued growth
9063182 we were all invited to a special week long trip to do photo and video shoots in eleuthera in the bahamas
9063183 when we were talking about the levy at the time the budget was done in the spring the erie power hydro plants on the river were still under their pilot payment in lieu of taxes program the city ended up letting that expire and placing them on the tax rolls
9063184 on average we would anticipate that taxpayers will pay 24 85 for every 1 000 their house is assessed at a year ago they wouldve been paying around 26 14 per every 1 000
9063185 i feel fortunate that they recognized that we had a need
9063186 the grant is called a grant in aid and its basically just additional state aid we were able to use some of it to lower the tax levy and some to purchase technology for the literacy initiative
9063187 i dont care that you fucked carol over after her near fatal accident left her with 3 kids and married a wealthy vixen i still think youre the bestest man ever
9063188 algunos pa ses europeos propondr n sanciones pero otros las rechazar n
9063189 en esta complicada situaci n pol tica hay que mantener un resto de sentido com n
9063190 padec an met stasis cerebrales que surgieron tras diferentes c nceres sobretodo de pulm n y mama que eran resistentes a todos los tratamientos
9063191 esta es la primera vez que se ha utilizado una tecnolog a l ser en la caja del cr neo junto con un aparato de resonancia magn tica nuclear irm
9063192 investigamos como utilizar de forma complementaria los ultrasonidos focalizados bajo control de la resonancia magn tica nuclear para destruir los c nceres de cerebro
9063193 el personal de las c rceles est obligado a usar un uniforme y a respetar todas las normas de una disciplina militar
9063194 no hay ninguna ley que obligue a las funcionarias a no usar el velo
9063195 la constituci n que es la ley suprema reconoce que marruecos es un estado musulm n y en consecuencia todas las dem s leyes deben respetar la libertad religiosa de la persona
9063196 el estado no est obligado a imponer el velo a las mujeres musulmanas y por lo tanto tampoco puede impedir su uso
9063197 est en situaci n de infracci n de uno de los principios de derechos humanos cuando impide el uso del velo
9063198 existen pa ses con tradici n democr tica como gran breta a donde se permite a los funcionarios militares o de seguridad usar sus s mbolos religiosos con uniformes
9063199 las investigaciones llevadas a cabo por las fuerzas de seguridad sobre esta fuga se centran en la posibilidad de que stos contaran con ayuda en el interior y exterior de la prisi n
9063200 yo creo que hay una convicci n err nea por parte del estado que considera el uso del velo como un s mbolo pol tico o que puede ser una amenaza a la seguridad eso no es verdad
9063201 en todo caso el estado no debe tomar una decisi n contraria a las libertades individuales
9063202 la misi n de reinserci n en las c rceles obliga a los vigilantes hombres y mujeres a evitar los s mbolos religiosos o ideol gicos en su vestido para poder dialogar con todos los presos y solucionar los problemas dentro de la c rcel
9063203 el respeto de las libertades individuales es una filosof a global y no puede ser selectiva seg n los casos

9063213 sarah palins chief qualification for being elected governor was that she was not frank murkowski
9063214 she was not elected because she was a conservative she was not elected because of her grasp of issues or because of her track record as the mayor of wasilla
9063215 i think it raises its profile i dont think it changes the steps you go through it is what it is you have to find out what happened
9063216 my boyfriend and i really want to try skydiving but were both poor students who are way too busy studying to get part time jobs so it looked
9063217 with creation you offer forth vibrations as we have said and often times you have a picture in your mind of how it should look how the manifestation should look what the process should be like and we are saying to you that this is a picture a series of pictures that actually hinders the universe from bringing that which you have asked so letting go of the story is not just letting go of who you think you are not just letting go of your identity it is literally letting go of expectation of attachment of everything and when you can do that you can truly move into expansion
9063218 i want it i dont want it vibrations often come into conflict
9063219 hold off because if i get that it wont feel as good as this
9063220 i know everything there is to know i am divine love

9063224 i have to say that as a woman there is something intuitively appealing about her selection even though i politically disagree with everything she believes in and would never in a million years vote for her

9063228 sen john mccains choice of alaska governor sarah palin as his running mate is a cynical effort to appeal to disappointed hillary clinton voters and get them to vote ultimately against their own self interest
9063229 sadly but not surprisingly identity politics has run amok in this country in my view palin wouldnt have been seriously considered for vice president but for her gender

9063258 she was scheduled for a high profile speaking role at our convention and included in the vp selection process because of his admiration for her strong reform credentials

9063318 these changes are perhaps slow to materialize but park ing day reminds us that common spaces public parks and nature in the city are important and valuable
9063319 i was never really a baker per se but my husband and kids developed a gluten intolerance
9063320 i learned how to bake out of necessity so i could make things for them to eat and then i would make things for friends who were gluten intolerant
9063321 but its so good in its own right that people who dont have that comparative expectation really find it amazing
9063322 people are so grateful that sometimes they cry because they havent eaten bread in years
9063323 ive also had moms with autistic kids that cant have gluten or casein so they buy our cookies its incredible overwhelming and beautiful and it validates what i do

9063327 the action is the same but the form changes there are different levels of poses but all the poses are a sweet opportunity to express yourself more fully this practice can be refined as you go deeper into aligning the body with your hearts intention
9063328 when youre surrounded by trash you really start thinking about your life and you think im adding to this problem
9063329 reusing is great recycling is great the problem is that its not efficient
9063330 getting a 40 percent return is not enough why would you cut down a tree to make a box when you can use our trash to make a better one
9063331 the marketplace over the last 20 years has been conditioned to do two things save time and money
9063332 will you come to rwanda with me where were creating this genocide memorial for survivors will you be our scribe
9063333 how can you have prairie dogs in the same book as a discussion of rwandan genocide survivors
9063334 the helpful eye of a teacher would really dispel some potentially injurious situations and help the student make quicker progress
9063335 establishing a home practice is one of the hardest things for anyone to do because it takes more discipline
9063336 as we touch your individual psyches you begin consciously to experience yourselves as intimately connected with all other life forms on this planet and throughout the cosmos
9063337 focus on just the exterior not the interior life of a home
9063338 weve gotten to a place where we dont think of ourselves as dwelling in nature we need to blur the boundaries between indoors and out and realize were part of rather than separated from the larger environment beyond our own four walls
9063339 the whole concept of organizing purging what you dont need being spatially aware in your personal environment is fundamentally eco friendly it encourages efficiency conservation and simplicity
9063340 but for softening or dyeing toxins might be used so definitely ask questions
9063341 draws every last drop from natural light to increase energy efficiency if you cant renovate because you rent or if you live in an older not so green home you should still work with existing light watch where the sun falls and use it to illuminate your indoor work whenever you can

9063345 cabrera will throw a side line on wednesday and pitch the first game of the spilt doubleheader a week from saturday against oakland
9063346 the way im looking at it is although we dont agree with it we dont think he was intentionally throwing at anybody we have to accept it and move on
9063347 hes going to have a normal winter of rest and come to spring training and go from there theres no purpose in him joining us for september
9063348 while yes it says things were worse than we actually thought then it doesnt necessarily tell us a lot about what happens next
9063349 the things that are interesting is that while growth has been slower than expected the things that are underlying it show a slowdown in consumer spending which is no surprise
9063350 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
9063351 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
9063352 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
9063353 the amount of money that is getting wagered on horses has been in a slow decline
9063354 you have a limited time to build a track a licence running out at stampede park and you have two breeds that need to be running at major tracks in calgary or edmonton
9063355 that doesnt leave any room for the standardbreds theres no track in calgary and edmonton is focusing on whats economically viable for them
9063356 as fred said horse racing alberta was set up as the administrative body to make these strategic decisions for the industry
9063357 the government really arent the people sic that are going to save the industry
9063358 these challenges are partly because from a pure economic activity point of view the racing of standardbreds is not as profitable as racing thoroughbreds
9063359 one was to promote the industry to grow the industry to regulate the industry and to foster the agricultural component of the industry
9063360 from the act id tell you the objects of our corporation is to govern direct control regulate manage market and promote horse racing in any and all of its forms
9063361 i think because we tried to do so much last year in such a short time we fell short on a few issues
9063362 these are meant to be short term measures to keep the industry together to keep the industry employed so that people can race their horses this is not a vision of the future
9063363 i appreciate the fear and the anxiety that these first events of the year have generated in the industry and i dont belittle them or downplay them at all
9063364 theres still a lot of negotiating to do but if youre in the standardbred industry and youve heard the news you would tend to panic tend to see a very dismal future and wonder where youll be going into that future particularly if youre a breeder whos invested a lot of time energy and money into improving your livestock at this point in time horse racing alberta is faced with a very significant challenge and i would say 80 per cent of our energy at the present is devoted to finding a solution to that challenge
9063365 i said we worked too hard were not going anywhere in fact were going further behind im not raising horses to race on a b meet
9063366 for our yearlings we bred them on promises by hra and uha that these things were going to happen we went and spent the money we invested in the industry and theyre about to hang us financially
9063367 harness has never had better pedigree and were selling them for less
9063368 we pulled our horses first time in 10 years we said were not going no point in us going we have no track we are not giving them away we are not paying an entry fee to the sale were not paying commission
9063369 i dont want to quit this business but theyve made it to the point where youre complaining to everything nothing is done how it should be done northlands just continues to insult you and you have good quality stuff on their track
9063370 youve got guys like me i work for a living in another job i own horses i breed horses but i still get to eat when the horses arent racing
9063371 the real essence of the problem is i think the industry has not done a good job establishing a customer base to support its long term viability
9063372 until the alberta tracks get figured out i wont be investing any more
9063373 film wise the lack of spectacular programming in this years festival really hit home yesterday i opted mistakenly i now think for the new
9063374 much more interesting but equally unlikely to make it to a cinema near you any time soon unless one of our film festivals has a brainstorm was a reconstruction of the original version of
9063375 intriguing and insightful the film shows that while the fantasy of abandoning everything and everyone and assuming a completely new identity might sound appealing the wisdom remains true wherever you go there you are
9063376 organizers of the venice film festival waited to announce the iranian film khastegi or tedium by first time iranian director bahman motamedian until the last minute to avoid alerting authorities to its sensitive subject transsexuals in modern day iran
9063377 we know that throughout the world this problems exists motamedian said
9063378 he wasnt to know it when he conceived the project seven years ago but parada which opens in italian cinemas in september is cruelly relevant to italys most pressing national debate for more than a year the country has been obsessed with what to do about the surge of impoverished immigrants from romania
9063379 last night was just about getting settled but in keeping with my practice of concentrating on foreign films i might never get to see as opposed to american films ill see sooner or later i saw
9063380 whenever people agree with me i feel that i must be wrong said
9063381 wilde also said everything popular is wrong you have only to look at the international box office list to see that he was right you have to go down the list to number 35 matteo garrone s gomorra before you can find a film that was not made for 12 year olds or adults with the same mentality
9063382 the cannes and venice festivals among others have the misguided idea that you have to open a festival with a crowd pleaser preferably an american one burn after reading is a crowd pleaser another attempt by the coen brothers to live down the time when their films were more personal quirky and less commercial despite some strained attempts at contemporary relevance their latest is really a very old fashioned juvenile farce with crude elements of the 70s paranoia films which except for the stream of fucks it could have been made decades ago
9063383 besides hannity thinks shes great and i agree with a lot of

9063407 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico

9063419 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9063420 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9063421 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9063422 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

9063439 this is not an opportunity to recap accomplishments over the past seven and a half years
9063440 it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama she underlined

9063508 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
9063509 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
9063510 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
9063511 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido

9063516 la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina
9063517 how could they know our child was ill and not tell the people who were in the best position to care for her
9063518 es un conflicto que el estado le ha instalado a la comunidad paichil antriao
9063519 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad
9063520 el conflicto no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
9063521 el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
9063522 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui
9063523 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
9063524 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano
9063525 and i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9063526 weve got our work cut out this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9063527 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment people are pissed off with us
9063528 undecided women liked sen hillary clinton because they saw her as qualified to be president this pick is an insult to them
9063529 people who take pride in the fact that they overpaid for something thats slightly broken
9063530 it can be overcast and raining hard or it can be sunny and cozy
9063531 you can watch the seasons change in that room and with each change in season the room has a different feel
9063532 the prefab options are much better than they were four yeas ago the lv house michelle kaufmans designs the blue dot flat pack the weehouse these havent come and gone theyve come and stayed but it will take 10 years for them to really become established
9063533 scott likes to be cutting edge be in on the next big trends for building and business
9063534 now that the house is done he gets a lot of cache from his friends for living in a prefab house
9063535 it couldnt be so precious or so expensive that muddy paws couldnt run through it without making me panic
9063536 the nice setback on the house leaves a tremendous space for gardening planting tomatoes basil and garlic
9063537 the windows the roofing the framing the plumbing the electrical every single area went over budget
9063538 we thought all in the cost would be around 250 per square foot its probably now closer to 350 per square foot it may be even be as high as 400 per square foot
9063539 its 10 acres surrounded by a 200 acre property you really feel like youre alone in the woods its such a great feeling to be totally connected i can sit there with my cell phone and wireless internet and have a video conference call with china on my deck using skype that was the idea to remain connected work remotely and get away from the cities
9063540 the big thing we were looking for was that modern look
9063541 thats what i think separates these new prefab homes from older iterations
9063542 ultimately people dont sense that its prefab except that it is a very simple space
9063543 ive observed stick built houses in our neighborhood that started sooner than ours and theyre still under construction
9063544 but in the end i dont know id have to do it all over again to really know if prefab is anything unique
9063545 what we werent prepared for was the quality of the house i have built several houses and this is by far the best quality home ive ever lived in its fabulous when you build on site theres little quality control the individual contractors are all supposed to do their jobs but the overall aesthetic is almost left to chance in a factory you have quality control at every step
9063546 we didnt compromise on any beauty or aesthetic at all to go with a green home
9063547 we havent gone green and said oh its different because its green going green has turned out to be aesthetically pleasing

9063556 swamiji ran into the toilet to save himself and shut the door mataji who hid behind the door was shot first the miscreants then broke open the toilet door and sprayed bullets
9063557 i rushed towards the main gate along with others only to see some men running around and loud cracking noise i heard the cries of swamiji and others i saw other swamijis running here and there i was scared and ran inside the hostel room with another girl we sat huddled together until after a long time one of the swamijis came and escorted us out of the room
9063558 i too rushed out after hearing the noise i saw bodies lying in blood i touched swamijis feet who was lying in the bathroom it was still warm but he did not move nor did mataji who lay inside the room
9063559 we had written 30 times to the state government that swamijis and our lives were at stake that we were being threatened by christian leaders before the incident we got a letter threatening to kill swamiji we formally complained to the police and district authorities they sent only four baton wielding constables
9063560 not a single minister visited us after the incident not even of our bjp the collector comes sometimes he gave us rice dal and sugar for the
9063561 the maoists can never do this it is christians who threaten us everyday and they did this
9063562 no one called us for any meeting or to take part in any peace process as long as are kept out the violence will continue
9063563 i know that when senator mccain gave me this opportunity he had a short list of highly qualified men and women and to have made that list at all was a great privilege and to have been chosen brings a great challenge i know that it demands the best that i have to give and i promise nothing less
9063564 i am delighted that senator mccain is running for president im excited to support him i never got into this with the idea that i needed or wanted something out of it
9063565 i went to bed last night very excited that he was the pick and i feel a little bit like i did in high school when my best friend was cut from the basketball team
9063566 hes reached the finals of the american idols of politics this is it at that point hes already a winner hes a winner this country has got to see his talent and his profile has been raised tremendously we always knew it and now the country knows it
9063567 if john mccain wins i think hell have an opportunity to serve in washington in the cabinet if he doesnt win hell be one of the big names in four years so the long term picture i think for tim pawlenty is still bright
9063568 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat
9063569 i think god is reminding us that on the eve of katrina god can bring nature back
9063570 a good thing about the mausoleums is that caskets can be removed later if a family should come forth and want to bury them themselves
9063571 we decided not to look backward we decided to look forward with all the progress weve made
9063572 i would like to have every one of those guys who attacked my farm go out with me to recover these animals and see the damage theyve done

9063749 no tenemos demasiado conocimiento del rival el futbol noruego en europa ltimamente no ha aparecido demasiado desde el rosemborg que fue un cl sico en la champions
9063750 por lo que nos hemos podido enterar es el campe n de la liga pasada este a o est en la zona media baja seguramente distra do por las previas de champions y sa es la poca informaci n que tenemos
9063751 el futbol noruego es de mucha fuerza y de mucho bal n a reo
9063752 hasta que lo vea no me atrevo a decirlo es el campe n de liga y te da siempre un respeto pero no s el nivel de la liga noruega no s qu tipo de equipo es la experiencia que tengo con el futbol noruego es de una eliminatoria con el celta y no puedo opinar demasiado hasta que vea un par de partidos
9063753 prefiero la vuelta en casa con todo lo que digan porque tienes ese margen tu afici n te puede ayudar hemos estado en intertoto la gente ha estado con dudas ante el rival de ayer en riazor no jugamos bien y el ambiente estaba fr o pero el partido de ayer con el ambiente que hab a y por c mo jug el equipo la afici n se va a animar a ilusionar y seguro que va a haber una gran entrada
9063754 todos queremos jugar la liguilla pero hay que ganarle a este equipo y hay que respetarlo
9063755 nos ha venido bien a todos por muchas razones primero por madurez en el aspecto individual de muchos jugadores que al principio notaban los nervios ante el ambiente que hab a que apretaba de lo lindo por la responsabilidad por pasar y la forma de conseguirlo
9063756 eso sirve para ilusionar a la afici n porque le puedes contar cosas pero al final lo que cuenta es lo que la afici n ve nosotros en casa no hab amos jugado bien en el teresa herrera jugamos mejor y ahora nos ha visto ayer y esa uni n con la afici n que crea en lo que haces es muy importante para nosotros
9063757 ya se ha creado un cl sico muy importante que nos llega a nosotros pero m s que nada debemos ganar por nosotros mismos y es una bonita prueba para seguir mejorando y creciendo ante un rival dif cil que juega bien el futbol adem s es en la cancha de ellos
9063758 yo creo repetir el cuadro ha venido jugando bien y tambi n pienso en darle m s minutos a daniel ludue a
9063759 esa es una de las motivaciones que tenemos todos intentar ganar el partido de ma ana contra monterrey y sacar los nueve puntos de la semana porque viene un per odo de receso en la que vamos a tratar de trabajar para mejorar muchas cosas porque despu s ya no vamos a tener tiempo de trabajar mucho en los aspectos que un equipo tiene que trabajar
9063760 yo creo que ah estamos obviamente a excepci n del partido contra am rica que no deb amos perder el equipo est bien porque sigue manejando los mismos conceptos d a con d a hemos tenido entrenamientos y estamos creciendo mucho en el aspecto f sico t cnico y t ctico y conforme vayan pasando los juegos se va a ir consolidando como un equipo m s fuerte todav a
9063761 s los objetivos est n muy claros para este equipo cada partido buscar ganar en la cancha que sea y obviamente en la suma de eso vas a estar en los primeros lugares

9063875 antes del juego coment que si concretaba no lo festejar a y as fue obviamente lo disfrut mucho por dentro porque no es f cil no lograrlo en tanto tiempo pero tengo confianza de que llegar n m s y esos s los celebrar

9063877 mi prioridad siempre fue quedarme en el barcelona es cierto que salieron cosas en la prensa pero no hubo nada oficial nada que viniera directamente de un directivo hacia m o de el entrenador
9063878 siempre que viene un t cnico nuevo existe cierta incertidumbre hasta que no sabes realmente lo que quiere de ti pep me lo dijo justo antes de las vacaciones y me quede tranquilo

9063904 i would like to have every one of those guys who attacked my farm go out with me to recover these animals and see the damage theyve done
9063905 these are done by underground activist groups who have a vested interested in remaining anonymous
9063906 we have good guys whove bought into what were doing and now its just a matter of going out and executing the defence that were beginning to have an understanding for
9063907 once we have a better understanding and we have people who are playing next to each other for more than one week at a time the communication becomes a little easier when you get some continuity in the players and calls then it becomes more instinctive
9063908 its kind of tough the first part of the season with injuries and guys having to move around a lot guys were having to do extra things but its a good feeling that the last couple of games weve been able to play as a unit
9063909 the maple ridge rcmp felt it may be an intentional act so they called our office

9063916 its not a technical recession but still the components are very weak consumer spending is slowing residential investment was negative business investment was negative the only thing keeping growth positive was government spending and inventories next week the boc will probably be on hold but clearly the risks are to the downside and if the data continue to weaken in the coming months there is a potential for a rate cut in october
9063917 todays report confirmed that the economy grew at a mild pace in the second quarter marking an improvement over the first quarter but still indicating limited momentum in the pace of activity the slump in employment in july moderating housing market activity and indications that the u s economy may have already hit this years high water mark in terms of the pace of growth in the second quarter will leave the bank of canada with concerns about the downside risk to their projection that the economy will grow at about a 1 5 pace over the second half of this year
9063918 on balance it is clear growth in canada has embarked on a softening trend fortunately it has not entered a technical recession but softness is still prevalent this report was softer than the bank of canadas projection but it is unlikely to sway the bank away from the sidelines given its admission earlier this week that the risks were to the downside but that it nonetheless retained a neutral bias the second half of the year is expected to remain soft as the follow through from weakness in the u s impacts canadian markets as such we expect rates to remain steady at 3 on wednesday when they meet next
9063919 whether real gdp shrank by a hair or grew by a hair is hardly the issue these numbers confirm that canada is mired in the worst economic slowdown in 17 years the terrible july employment numbers suggest that the bigger recession may just be beginning now if that employment trend continues then gdp will clearly decline in the third quarter of this year and at a much faster pace than in the first quarter in other words if we focus on what is happening in the economy today rather than what was happening in the spring the outlook is even more bleak than todays release indicates
9063920 we are excited to have paul dawson join the blazers he adds size and toughness to our team and at only 22 paul has a tremendous upside he is a true gentleman but early in his career he has developed a reputation as someone you do not want to mess with on the floor

9063942 sabemos que ser un rival muy complicado viene con buen ritmo ganando todos los partidos vienen jugando bien pero tenemos confianza de que tenemos que revertir la situaci n del ltimo partido de monterrey ya que venimos de perder tenemos que salir a ganar los tres puntos no nos queda de otra
9063943 llegamos bien con la necesidad y urgencia de ganar el d a de ma ana para no quedarnos atr s en la tabla sabemos que ser un partido muy dif cil pero conf amos en que revertiremos esta situaci n
9063944 no estar n cansados cruz azul nosotros participamos el mi rcoles con la cancha imposible de jugar y por ello tambi n tuvimos un gran desgaste
9063945 la meta nuestra es buscar sumar de a tres puntos tenemos que empezar a ganar sino nos vamos a quedar muy atr s ser a bueno ganar y qu mejor ante un gran rival como cruz azul para poder levantar estamos preocupados porque queremos estar en los primeros lugares y hoy en d a estamos de mitad de tabla para atr s tenemos que revertir esta situaci n
9063946 no hemos tenido contundencia se han tenido oportunidades hemos tenido oportunidades claras de gol y las hemos concretado aunque buscaremos contretar todas las oportunidades en el resto de los partidos
9063947 debemos estar m s concentrados los primeros minutos nos han costado durante ese tiempo los goles en contra aunque tambi n los hemos remontado y eso obviamente te cuesta el doble cruz azul tiene un gran equipo y tendremos que estar aplicados los 90 minutos ya que pueden ganarnos el partido en alguna jugada
9063948 hemos sido regulares no hemos sido lo que hab amos pretendido pero se han dado muchas circunstancias como expulsiones y situaciones en donde jugamos con un jugador menos tambi n est n las malas condiciones como nos pas ante monterrey al final de todo no son excusas pero son cosas que han pasado y que debemos superar
9063949 quiero ganarme un lugar nuevamente en el equipo tratar de aprovechar las oportunidades de gol y hacer lo que anteriormente hice en m xico hacer goles
9063950 fue una jugada desafortunada uno quiere impedir una situaci n de gol pero bueno tenemos que seguir adelante el equipo no baja los brazos matem ticamente todav a falta bastante y tenemos un buen equipo tenemos que seguir demostr ndolo
9063951 estoy triste por el hecho pero durante el partido entregu todo por esa raz n me fui tranquilo a mi casa dolido pero s que en cada partido doy mi vida duele que uno por error haga un gol en contra y la gente este silbando despu s de que uno hace su mayor esfuerzo en cada partido simplemente fue una situaci n que le puede pasar a cualquiera
9063952 estamos tranquilos para enfrentarnos a chivas pero con optimismo a pesar de no haber ganado ayer un descuido nos cost el partido pero a n as el equipo est tranquilo para el siguiente encuentro tenemos jugadas que necesitamos reafirmar falta tranquilidad al definir necesitamos calma para tomar la decisi n correcta al jugar calma para decidir
9063953 they told me i was going to a contending team and that made it a little easier to accept than if i was going to a team that was out of the race that would have been different
9063954 they have a good ballpark for hitters ive always hit well there its close to home
9063955 basically i picked up the schedule and looked at who were playing stuff like that

9063958 being a canadian player on the only canadian team i wanted to retire as a blue jay but who knows whats going to happen

9063968 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me
9063969 i would rather hear you say that at the end of the trial rather than the beginning
9063970 may i hold you to your word that i am not guilty
9063971 when i told people i wanted to be a priest they were shocked and disbelieving some of them thought i should be committed
9063972 now if a youth says he wants to be a priest there is huge discouragement it is seen as a very silly career move
9063973 i was ordained 22 years ago and when i was in the seminary there were a hundred of us just for the dublin diocese
9063974 a woman in the sacristy at a wedding on saturday looked at me and said are you the parish priest
9063975 and its not going to get any easier morale can be low at times you are just working so hard and theres nobody coming behind you
9063976 we have had no candidates for the priesthood for 12 years maybe 15 no intake in that length of time
9063977 way back we had so many priests they were sent on loan to glasgow or england or america
9063978 its the secularisation of ireland the reduction in family size ireland has just caught up with the more secular europe with its more libertarian values good values around freedom and individuality and personal choice
9063979 it really bolsters you buoys you up to see that
9063980 but theres absolutely no need to be they can see it as a sort of competition theyre afraid that if they give people more power theyre going to lose power
9063981 but it isnt like that its a collaborative effort a sharing of responsibility it takes a lot of weight off the priest
9063982 for us to be able to survive we must share the workload said fr mullan
9063983 its quite threatening to the professional identity of the priest when non ordained people come into work in the parish theyre to be paid more than the clergy and perhaps in time their status will be equal to or greater than the clergy
9063984 its up to us to reorganise things and adapt to the change
9063985 we have to recognise whatever god is saying to us about combining the roles of the clergy and the laity
9063986 the court is well aware that there are real risks to the class associated with the settlement that it finally approves today
9063987 however like the parties the court has evaluated these risks in light of the even greater risks of not settling this dispute

9064008 los instrumentos aztecas como los silbatos con forma de calavera poseen caracter sticas de construcci n que no se encuentran en ning n otro instrumento musical conocido

9064016 the year over year yoy growth rate of tms is presently about 3 5 to put it another way tms tells us that the inflation money supply growth rate is presently in the bottom quartile of its 10 year range our statement that the us inflation rate is presently in the bottom quartile of its 10 year range may appear to be absurd given that the prices for various commodities and everyday goods services are rocketing upward but todays rising prices are largely due to the massive inflation that occurred years ago specifically the massive inflation in the us during 1998 2004 and outside the us during 2003 2006 there is often a multi year lag between the cause money supply growth and the effect rising prices which is one reason why so few people are able to see the link between money supply changes and purchasing power changes during any long term inflation cycle the major beneficiaries of the inflation will be the sectors of the economy where the supply demand fundamentals are the most bullish that is those sectors where there is relative scarcity commodities should continue to be the major beneficiaries during the current inflation cycle a cycle thats probably nowhere near an end because thats where the relative scarcity now lies but the downward correction in the money supply growth rate over the past few years creates an intermediate term hazard for commodity investors we expect that wider recognition of the inflation problem will eventually bring about a major decline in treasury bond prices a major rise in bond yields but the temporarily slow rate of us money supply growth over the past 2 3 years could support us t bond prices over the coming 6 months by putting irresistible downward pressure on the prices of industrial commodities

9064094 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
9064095 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture
9064096 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter

9064099 im somewhat skeptical how much improvement theyre going to make at this point
9064100 anyone checking any code into windows 7 not only has to make sure its the most secure code and the most reliable code but theyd better be addressing the performance of the code as well
9064101 keep the cpu utilization low as that improves multi user scenarios as well as reduces power consumption
9064102 i thought heres another unknown untested from alaska that you question the electoral benefit it brings to the ticket
9064103 barack obamas campaign had an opportunity to put a strong woman on as everybodys president and they decided not to do it on a number of levels i think its a great idea
9064104 shes made more decisions as an executive than barack obama has ever made in his days as a state senator and in the few moments that hes been in the u s senate
9064105 his pick today proves that hes going to do what he wants to do and what he thinks is right and what he thinks is best and not what some poll tells him and not what his consultants or his advisors tell him
9064106 it appears at this point to be sort of cynical ploy to go after the hillary clinton supporters that seems to be one of the main strategies they saw a little thing in the polls that suggested that 20 percent of the hillary supporters are not going to vote for barack
9064107 she got a public policy perspective shes got an ideology and shes going for it shes not a shrinking violet
9064108 it just makes an interesting year that much more interesting hang on folks its going to be a bumpy ride

9064130 she is smart vivacious and energetic she tends to oversimplify complex issues has had difficulty delegating authority and clearly has difficulty distinguishing the line between her public responsibilities and private wishes
9064131 her approval ratings are high 65 percent or so but down from 80 percent earlier in her term most alaskans havent watched her as closely as most reporters or legislators if you took a poll of reporters and legislators i expect her approval rating would be down in the teens or twenties
9064132 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth on his plans
9064133 i simply dont think that the people of florida are gonna say the nominee of our party ought to be a person who on more than one occasion has expressed lack of understanding of our economy at a time when the economy is the number one issue that people are talking about here in the state of florida
9064134 i know that there are some people who think as sen mccain did he said you know some jobs are leaving michigan and theyre not coming back i disagree
9064135 some politicians as i said are more interested in insults than issues
9064136 if people give you a shelter you should take it

9064148 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
9064149 on friday you may see intermittent unavailability for chat while we restart servers and rapidly push out new releases this will be a brief period hopefully no more than a day or two while we iron out the initial issues

9064156 while the usage level specified is high it is now finite a line has been crossed
9064157 im very interested in food and im really impressed by what theyve done here
9064158 ive heard about slow food and knew it was from italy but this is amazing the garden is beautiful and it should always be here
9064159 everyone said that slow food cant work in the united states
9064160 but it can food farming and environmental issues are closely linked
9064161 looking for one ticket for friday food pavilion and also looking for two tickets to sundays food pavilion at fort mason will pay 50 a ticket
9064162 in my family everyone loves sweets but no one wanted to cook
9064163 every holiday i was in the kitchen making cobblers and pies so now its a little business
9064164 at least some of that land could be turned into productive use food is an important issue and we need to support supporting local agriculture in a big way
9064165 tenemos que revisar los fundamentos del mercado saber cu l es la tendencia para tomar una decisi n al d a de hoy la tendencia es mantener la producci n tal como est aunque valoremos un posible recorte
9064166 s estoy de acuerdo la tendencia es mantener la producci n
9064167 but those who are ready to toil in the most excellent pursuits will not desist from the search after truth till they get the demonstration from the scriptures themselves
9064168 but whether all things were made out of any underlying matter i have yet failed anywhere to find where such a statement is written hermogenes shop must tell us if it is nowhere written then let it fear the woe which impends on all who add or take away from the written word
9064169 the company had an opportunity to come to its employees with an offer that rewarded them for their hard work by offering a top of the industry contract and some real job security and it failed on all counts
9064170 o mundo rabe e parte das popula o americana suspeitavam que os estados unidos tinham entrado em guerra precisamente para proteger a riqueza petrol fera que estes contratos procuram garantir

9064174 o que n o surpreendente tendo em conta que o seu principal testa de ferro no iraque o conselho supremo isl mico iraquiano apoio essencial do governo maliki domina o estado iraquiano
9064175 porque os estados unidos e o ir partilham o mesmo testa de ferro

9064178 everyones closing out positions traders never want to leave them open over a holiday weekend with a storm coming
9064179 we could shut in production in the gulf for 3 5 days and not impact storage negatively
9064180 its possible that people are worried that next week the storm will be past and the price will resume dropping
9064181 august is going out with a bang for the energy markets as gustav rolls in and hanna and her sisters are following right behind
9064182 cyclone activity is really ramping up and all along the gulf coast the storm watch is in full gear
9064183 if gustav does damage to refining or drilling facilities then all bets are off as to how high gasoline and heating oil could go but the most incredible spike could be left for natural gas which is already at bargain basement levels
9064184 are not sure where the hurricane will land too early to tell
9064185 i want to go into a long weekend with no investments in oil related stocks etc
9064186 a potentially disastrous storm similar to hurricane katrina could damage oil and gas production facilities in the region causing very significant supply disruptions

9064190 she seems like a compelling person with a terrific personal story
9064191 he also wished her good luck but not too much luck
9064192 im sure that she will help make the case for republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same and so ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket
9064193 he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming gov palin agrees with him and his policies
9064194 the fact that she will soon be nominated is one more indicator of this country moving forward one more hit against that glass ceiling
9064195 i congratulate her and look forward to a vigorous debate
9064196 im pleased with my choice for vice president joe biden i think hes the man who can help me guide this country in a better direction and help working families
9064197 i think that uh you know campaigns start getting these uh hair triggers and uh the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9064198 ubiqu monos en esa poca pinochet comandante en jefe terror a la fuga de capitales ejercicios de enlace hab a que defender la econom a y la democracia a toda costa tuvimos que concederles mucho a muchos como el estatuto docente a los profesores y el silencio sobre las privatizaciones a los empresarios

9064202 make sure to take care of them when they come home because theyre starting to treat them the way they treated us
9064203 one that i will live with for the rest of my life
9064204 june 20th was undoubtedly the worst day of my life
9064205 in my fatigue i simply forgot forrest remained in the car
9064206 my hope is that this type of accident will never happen to another police canine or police officer again
9064207 is extremely difficult due to traffic jams on freeways and major rural routes
9064208 they re the most important part without them we can t pass or hand off the ball the line was amazing the fullbacks were incredible
9064209 they have some size some athletic looking kids and they have some speed we have to play a lot better
9064210 the defense played well we worked hard on passing kinnick quarterback jon bollinger is a good quarterback with quality people to throw to
9064211 the fact is volunteers meet the needs of those in crisis all over the place
9064212 why not cultivate the volunteer spirit to help meet the needs of navy families in crisis and help take care of our own
9064213 i want the victim to feel like they re not alone and that there s light at the end of the tunnel
9064214 i think it would be a big mistake for us to try to say that we know the person who s calling and how they re feeling
9064215 however what we do know is that they re reaching out
9064216 keep in mind that filing a return for the sole purpose of establishing eligibility for the payment does not impact your tax situation in any way
9064217 there will be no tax due that was not due before no tax on the supplemental payment and no obligation to file in the future unless your tax situation changes
9064218 this is much more than a renaming of commands it is a transformation of how we perform the military mission in south korea
9064219 it showed they were taking control of their country and progressing forward
9064220 we got them fresh out of school but they performed beyond my expectations
9064221 i loved it i d go back in a heartbeat
9064222 it s what people sign up for they don t sign up to be in garrison they sign up to be in a war zone
9064223 it was i m in iraq let s put the game face on but after a while you got use to it
9064224 the first thing going through your minds is i want to take a shower drink a beer and go do something
9064225 there are plenty of things to do but you don t have to do them tonight
9064226 i m not too proud to go back into doing labor work to feed my family
9064227 i think that s what scares me the most my young daughter is still developing
9064228 i hear about layoffs and people getting fired back home i know that i get that military pay check every first and fifteenth
9064229 i m not sure of what i want to do
9064230 the reality kicks in of having to pay for housing for food and you see their eyes open up and they say i didn t know it was that bad
9064231 it was tough back then the pay didn t compare to the military
9064232 i made a lot of money mistakes in the past
9064233 with age comes wisdom that has a lot to do with that
9064234 this class may change their minds because we re being taken care of by the military
9064235 if you re younger and single you may not have as many stresses as those who are married with kids
9064236 it s going to be really hard especially with the economy back in the states
9064237 that s a huge thing for us to have only one income it s going to be a big change
9064238 we didn t have any major flooding there was no physical facility damage no trees down
9064239 i m from west texas and you see it all the time there but i haven t seen it that rough here before
9064240 the base should ve supplied some sort of alternate energy source especially if we re going to be out that long stuff in the refrigerator and freezer was going bad
9064241 it s the worst storm i ve seen and this is the second time we ve been here
9064242 other than those 4 300 seats which are going to subsidize everybody else the prices are not
9064243 and remember 24 000 plus seats will have no price increase at all
9064244 established procedures mandate that at least two of the officers must remain awake while in control of these items
9064245 the nuclear deterrence mission remains the foundation of our country s defense and we are proud to be a part of it
9064246 we hold everyone involved in this mission to the highest standards of performance and accountability every day and we will not tolerate substandard performance
9064247 those areas where others have found fault we are going to work with a vengeance and we ll tidy that up
9064248 and the united states air force will remain the finest air force on the planet
9064249 changes to bonus amounts are the result of an intensive effort to provide the fleet with the right sailor at the right place and the right time
9064250 these highly skilled ratings are in great demand and srbs are a market driven incentive designed to encourage those sailors with the necessary skills and experience to stay navy
9064251 in this way i can show sailors that the navy needs more of a certain skill and we will reward them financially for getting the advanced qualification we need
9064252 these guys probably had ties to insurgents in the area
9064253 but it has been a very complex fight both the soi and iraqi security forces view themselves as protectors of the population
9064254 i think the iraqi government will eventually take full control of them but for now they have a job they re helping our forces and they want to secure the neighborhoods
9064255 a little longer than day to day hes going to need a little bit of time
9064256 hes like julian tavarez has been the past couple of years he can be a long reliever a short reliever or a starter
9064257 i hope that the situation is not so serious as it may have looked
9064258 oh hey i know you youre in my political science class
9064259 the transference of thoughts or feelings between two or more subjects
9064260 coming to the knicks and hopefully being able to contribute means a lot to me
9064261 it has been my dream to play for this team my goal is to show the coaches i can play and do all that i can to help the team win some games
9064262 multi cultural game development is a major theme when you are talking about a region such as the asia pacific
9064263 with the number of international companies we are presenting as well as some confirmed world exclusive premieres we are confident this years gca and gcac will eclipse last years show in terms of knowledge exchange and importance on a global level
9064264 games exchange alliance sees gca as a key platform and partner for the regional gaming industry
9064265 after the signing of the memorandum of understanding by different gaming industry associations in this region during last years gca we will take a significant step at this years gca for the growth of the regional gaming industry
9064266 gca 2008 is going to be an exciting event for the local and regional gaming community
9064267 not only will attendees get to see the latest gaming products from the asia pacific but they will also receive first hand experience on the importance of the video game industry in singapore and asia
9064268 this years gcac pulls together an escellent speaker line up covering both development and business topics and there are some amazing keynotes planned by joonmo kwon cevat yerli and others
9064269 gcacs the biggest show for game developers from across asia to come together to learn network and play with their peers from around the world
9064270 its also very exciting that gcac is giving back to the community by creating the free of charge gcac student day where some of the best speakers from the show will do a full day program specifically tailored to aspiring students of game development
9064271 if we put three hats on them and make them not want to get up thats the way to beat texas
9064272 when you dont have to get out on the field and do something its easy to say something about it the real talk is when you line up
9064273 anything he would say hes trying to motivate his team and thats fair
9064274 when they recruit they choose who they want they have great athletes who can run very well
9064275 last year nobody knew who i was this year everybodys gunning for me
9064276 thats a big change its going to be hard to do the same thing i did last year
9064277 going into the rutgers game ray rice actually told me that they game planned for me thats the point i knew everybody was going after me
9064278 george is probably working as hard as ive ever seen him work
9064279 its about focus and discipline being prepared and trying to step up your game every time out he does a good job of that
9064280 there are always going to be doubters we went up to no 2 so fast then when we got up there we lost
9064281 weve still got the underdog mentality but other teams are not going to take us lightly
9064282 we do this we do that we know whats best for you just ask us
9064283 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
9064284 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
9064285 wrong side of the sheets liaison between johnsons great grandmother and a descendant of george ii such ancestry means johnson is related to all the royal families of europe
9064286 wir haben momentan einen lauf der sieg war auch wieder verdient

9064290 that american spirit that american promise that prushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend
9064291 we want awesome people to work with who will be contributing members of our team of rockstars
9064292 our state of the art office premises include a quality toilet seat
9064293 is capable of setting up an ssl certificate on apache
9064294 right now they are staging more assets and planting urban search and rescue personnel with the local ema as liaisons to let them know what resources are available
9064295 it was like being in new york city with one of the beatles
9064296 people were stopping in the streets and climbing up things to see him they were going nuts hes like a superstar
9064297 for americas kids the time to play and swim is today
9064298 we need everyones help in providing all kids with safe and well equipped spaces where they can exercise have fun and maybe even begin to pursue their own
9064299 from the look on his face being in that pool was the highlight of his day all the stress just melted away
9064300 why is the seattle police department allowing urban terrorists to run amok this is one of the most idiotic molly coddling of criminals ive ever heard of
9064301 barack obama has won the iowa caucuses youd have to have a heart of stone not to feel moved by this an african american man wins a closely fought campaign in a pivotal state he beats two strong opponents including the mighty clinton machine he does it in a system that favors rural voters he does it by getting young voters to come out to the caucuses this is a huge moment its one of those times when a movement that seemed ethereal and idealistic became a reality and took on political substance
9064302 and in denver we democrats showed america that we have cute daughters who will someday provide us with prestigious car window stickers
9064303 in a way i think theyre proud of themselves for discovering us and theyre not going to give that up
9064304 its almost like theyre holding onto us as long as they can theyve made our career if it werent for them im sure we would have been dropped by the label years ago and we might be painting houses again i just want it to work over here without losing our fan base over there i dont want to lose one side of the pond because the other side likes us
9064305 i always felt that people would look at me as a guy from tennessee who dropped out of high school and try to point out everything that i said that wasnt necessarily proper or intelligent
9064306 i was writing these melodies that i felt were so pretty and so deserving to be heard properly that i just kind of bit the bullet and said sing the way that you know how to sing
9064307 this is president richard milhouse nixon with an important message for broward county democrats
9064308 scott israel is a good man in fact he was a republican only months ago hes really one of us you see scott israel is my kind of guy a real operator and just like me he is not a crook
9064309 i like to think scott israel is a bush republican at heart
9064310 scott israel reminds me of my ex partner bernie kerik shoot first ask questions later
9064311 i can tell you without a doubt that roger stone was involved in that campaign
9064312 if you want to say im a republican scumbag fine but dont say that i have anything to do with what bova was doing
9064313 that was totally unrelated to us and if somebody slanders my law firm there will be hell to pay
9064314 tony bova had his eyes on getting involved in restaurants in broward county before he and i were partners
9064315 he asked me how do i get in who do i need to support i told him that you want to make sure you have an excellent relationship with the county commission the city governance and an excellent relationship with any police department that controls any area where you are going to do business
9064316 my guess is that you will see him heavily involved in political races in the future
9064317 she seems like a super lady and we have always loved her but dear god joe biden is going to eat her for breakfast
9064318 mom i dont think people should live down there its not safe
9064319 treason against the united states shall consist only in levying war against them or in adhering to their enemies giving them aid and comfort
9064320 somebody in his administration leaked the name of that person valerie plame
9064321 the possibility of penetrating these groups the possibility of knowing that theyre going to carry 10 pound bags of explosive in the subway stations will go right down the drain
9064322 every foreign intelligence service would run plames name through its databases within hours of its publication to determine if she had visited their country and to reconstruct her activities
9064323 humint is about human beings its about one person an american person a case officer in the parlance of the trade causing some foreign person to trust him enough and to trust his unit and to trust the united states enough to put his life his fortune and indeed his sacred honor in many cases into the hands of this case officer
9064324 if within a practicing clandestine intelligence unit the case officers believe that their superiors will not protect the identity of their sources or their own identity in fact in doing things which are dangerous and difficult then a kind of circle of doubt begins to spread like throwing a rock into the water
9064325 i do solemnly swear or affirm that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states

9064358 cabrera will throw a side line on wednesday and pitch the first game of the spilt doubleheader a week from saturday against oakland
9064359 the way im looking at it is although we dont agree with it we dont think he was intentionally throwing at anybody we have to accept it and move on
9064360 hes going to have a normal winter of rest and come to spring training and go from there theres no purpose in him joining us for september
9064361 today i notified csu athletic director paul kowalczyk that we would exercise this option
9064362 we will continue a dialogue with our colleagues at csu on the future of this great series beyond 2010 but it is very important that we host a sixth home game next year to live up to our commitment to our fans and to remain consistent with the standards of our big 12 conference
9064363 in a way that would meet cus minimum home game commitment while continuing a strong presence for the game in denver beyond 2010
9064364 we are disappointed by cus decision as we believe the series ultimately belongs in denver however in light of cus decision to play the 2009 game in boulder we believe we owe it to colorado state university our alumni fans students and the city of fort collins to bring the 2010 game back to hughes stadium we look forward to working with cu to ensure the continuation of the series beyond 2010
9064365 the prime ministers legal actions are an attempt to use the courts to interfere with the official oppositions freedom of political expression and thereby give his party an advantage over his principal political opponents
9064366 such an injection of legal action into our political debates were it to succeed would give the government party a political advantage over its opponents

9064368 hon next time you plan taking me out on an officially winter day could you just maybe in case it snowed somehow let me know about it so that i can you know put on a different kind of shoes one that covers at least my ankles
9064369 jeeez woman i never knew you could produce so much nonsense
9064370 or is it my fault for not having shut up your sweet dirty little mouth for quite some time eh
9064371 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9064372 her selection is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9064373 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9064374 she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same
9064375 is one more indicator of this country moving forward the fact that youve got a woman
9064376 vice presidential nominee of one of the major parties i think is one more hit against that glass ceiling
9064377 i think you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9064378 he also wished her good luck but not too much luck
9064379 nobody knew about his announcement this morning except a traveling aide and the governors chief of staff who found out about this last night
9064380 the fundamental principle behind any selection of a running mate would be whether that person is fully prepared to take over and shares your values your principles your philosophy and your priorities
9064381 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice
9064382 and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
9064383 john mccain followed her career and admired her tenacity and her many accomplishments
9064384 she was scheduled for a high profile speaking role at our convention and included in the vp selection process because of his admiration for her strong reform credentials
9064385 she gave a slightly different answer and left the door slightly open as opposed to shutting down all the speculation up front
9064386 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9064387 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9064388 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9064389 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9064390 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9064391 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9064392 he sees sarah governor palin as the future of the party
9064393 these are people hed like to elevate in that regard reformers
9064394 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency
9064395 that ring of fire it hurts it hurts ow oh my god etc
9064396 that is weird my throat hurts a lot like ive been screa oh my gosh i just screamed for 2 and half hours didnt i

9064399 oh crap yea its probably in your bloodstream if its popping up out of nowhere get some meds or something let it run its course
9064400 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit cards bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this this country is more decent than one where a woman in ohio on the brink of retirement finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work were a better country than one where a man in indiana has to pack up the equipment that hes worked on for 20 years and watch as its shipped off to china and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news we are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty
9064401 you cant say that you cant think that its not possible for you to be so utterly and destructively selfish
9064402 im just being as honest as i can be and as i have to be and really you know i have no choice
9064403 you have all kinds of great of wonderful choices we could do anything we could go anywhere we could live together we could travel together we could go back to school somewhere we could work on those old cars you wanted we could write poetry we could buy those great big dogs like we saw at the house in flagstaff we could we could
9064404 please dont do this to me ok please dont think this even or say these things anymore ok dont bring this into our lives now just change jeffrey change please change for me right now and well go back and well go to my house and ill put the cats out so we can make love in front of the fireplace and ill play my old cant be tuned guitar for you and you can make up songs for me that dont have to rhyme just like we did last tuesday night and everything will be all right again well be back all right again remember ok
9064405 i just asked her to marry me and she said no
9064406 ok now jeff you asked her to marry you and she said no and then what else i know thats not all of it what made her lose it like that the way she did
9064407 i simply asked her to marry me and she said no and then she said that she would never under any circumstances want to marry me couldnt even think of ever marrying me that i was too old for her anyway and that i knew that so dont be boring and she was still browsing and even though she loved me sometimes dont push it i didnt own her and she had a great date lined up for tomorrow night so back off cause she might still recieve better offers here yet today
9064408 he went on home he paid all your bills by the way and he got the hell out
9064409 and you just let him go by himself didnt you talk to him didnt he tell you what he said tonight to tamara
9064410 hell yes he told us he told us he proposed his fuckin heart out to tamara and she shot him down like a kamikase pilot over the goddammed alamo
9064411 did he tell you what he said what he said not what tamara answered him yes tammy didnt want to marry him but did he tell you what he said back to her
9064412 he told me that if i couldnt love him enough to marry him then there was nothing left for him and he would go home right now and kill himself tonight he would have to commit suicide if i didnt love him like he loved me
9064413 they were incapable of ever being unaware of the others love radiating presence in any given room each one was made brighter by standing in the others shadow and it mattered
9064414 other than those 4 300 seats which are going to subsidize everybody else the prices are not
9064415 and remember 24 000 plus seats will have no price increase at all
9064416 this clearly indicates that the market is not what it was
9064417 two years ago youd be pressed to find an apartment that sold for less than its purchase price
9064418 everyones saying the luxury market is so hot but something like that sends a signal that maybe it isnt
9064419 its definitely something new in a really hot market this wouldnt happen
9064420 if youre not priced appropriately its not going to sell
9064421 the market condition story of manhattan has been clouded by the inclusion of a high concentration of new developments into the housing stock
9064422 when you talk about resale its very hard to make the case that the typical apartment today is worth more than it was six months ago
9064423 its a broad based sample suggesting its not an anomaly
9064424 were very lucky given what the rest of the country is going through
9064425 if you think you were going to make a big profit its going to be a disappointment
9064426 if youre going to buy something on the other end you can do well
9064427 how can i use my bronzer in the fall and winter months
9064428 above all the speech reflects on the role of the presidency and the qualities that are demanded by the job and makes the case that john mccain is the best qualified to be our next leader and commander in chief said spokeswoman dana perino
9064429 do not expect the speech to define the presidents legacy ms perino cautioned
9064430 this is not an opportunity to recap accomplishments over the past seven and a half years
9064431 it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama she underlined
9064432 the major issues facing the country from terrorism and war to the economy and the direction of our culture but the speech also
9064433 the president will thank his family his administration and most of all the friends supporters and volunteers in the convention hall who have supported him and the republican agenda for these past eight years
9064434 some of the attacks are just out and out false for example suggesting that the bush administration hasnt invested in alternative or renewable energies
9064435 were in high political season were not going to let it get to us were going to focus on the big picture she said
9064436 above all the speech reflects on the role of the presidency and the qualities that are demanded by the job and makes the case that john mccain is the best qualified to be our next leader and commander in chief said spokeswoman dana perino
9064437 the united states has overstepped its borders in all spheres economic political and humanitarian and has imposed itself on other states
9064438 these men appeared to be the cutting edge of capitalism in russia
9064439 ambulance services hospitals and regional polyclinics were left completely without funds
9064440 putin and his fsb successor to the kgb faction realized in the late 1990s that however lucrative the economic opening process might have been for some the net effect on russia was catastrophic
9064441 concentration of ownership is high and the sector is dominated by state ownership
9064442 russia witnessed the highest growth in hnwi populations high net wealth individuals those with liquid assets of 30mn plus
9064443 russias market capitalisation took off in 2006 on the heels of several ipos and the liberalisation of the countrys banking market
9064444 the fuel sector oil and gas dominates the russian economy
9064445 various attempts are being made to contain russia including through the eastward expansion of the north atlantic treaty organisation in violation of previous assurances given to moscow
9064446 the united states displayed an almost uncontained hyper use of force in international relations so no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race
9064447 before russia returns to soviet military levels you are looking at a decade plus of sustained high level military investment

9064455 a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9064456 the mccain palin ticket will appeal to voters across party lines
9064457 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9064458 puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team
9064459 governor palin has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform that we need in washington
9064460 governor palin has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today

9064465 weve got too many guys out there that have road rage they have the tendency to go off the deep end against other drivers weve had instances in parking lots with other drivers
9064466 its frustrating it cost me more time and money to be out there properly and you have these guys left and right just popping anything on the road calling it a taxi basically dipping into my pocket and taking my wallet and taking money out of it

9064472 fire and police have an advocate and a political group noncivil service employees dont have anyone to speak for them

9064480 unfortunately showing that the bennett group lied is not enough to turn back the clock and return the sonics as a result i am withdrawing our lawsuit

9064482 cabrera will throw a side line on wednesday and pitch the first game of the spilt doubleheader a week from saturday against oakland
9064483 the way im looking at it is although we dont agree with it we dont think he was intentionally throwing at anybody we have to accept it and move on
9064484 hes going to have a normal winter of rest and come to spring training and go from there theres no purpose in him joining us for september
9064485 this is going to be a real good test for us because theyre going to come out and throw the ball at least 40 times
9064486 its a way for the secondary to make a name for ourselves in the first game
9064487 the michigan game was really a wake up call for us
9064488 we did not stop them the whole day they were up and down the field now when you go into the offseason at least you have something to point to when guys start thinking about how good they think they are
9064489 all you had to do is just turn on the film and just say hey guys lets just go back to last season and lets look at that and well see how good we really think we are
9064490 they do throw the ball around a lot and we do need to improve
9064491 this game just because of what happened last year is going to be an early test for us
9064492 coming to the knicks and hopefully being able to contribute means a lot to me

9064519 a human being is a part of the whole called by us universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty

9064540 if a domestic solution isnt a part of a national energy plan then our nation is in a world of hurt
9064541 were going to continue to be reliant on foreign dangerous regimes to feed our hungry markets
9064542 shes taken the ethical high ground and distanced herself from veco
9064543 she also has attempted to reverse the course established by the murkowski administration which was one where the administration directly negotiated with the oil industry in secret
9064544 gov palin certainly showed leadership on the gas line if sen mccain happens to be elected as president that would put a strong representative in the administration in washington thats in favor of an alaska gas line
9064545 this is a tool that must be on the table to buy us time until our long term energy plans can be put into place we have already enjoyed the support of alaska senator ted stevens and it is gratifying to see senator obama get on board
9064546 shes either grossly misinformed or intentionally misleading and both are unbecoming
9064547 even the bush administration cant deny the reality of global warming
9064548 the governor is aligning herself and the state of alaska with the most discredited fringe extreme viewpoints by denying this
9064549 shes not totally convinced one way or the other science will tell us she thinks the jurys still out
9064550 one of the most anti environment records of any governor in the united states
9064551 she has supported oil drilling in some of the most ecologically sensitive areas in alaska even when it meant sacrificing polar bears beluga whales and the arctic national wildlife refuge
9064552 despite her advocacy for expanded oil and gas drilling palin has done almost nothing to promote the clean energy sources that can help solve global warming which is already having major negative consequences in her state
9064553 a changing environment will affect alaska more than any other state because of our location
9064554 im not one though who would attribute it to being man made
9064555 sort of the origin tale that mixes the historical prince vlad of transylvania with sort of fictionalized bram stoker take
9064556 we did a revolutionary commentary half of its a musical
9064557 we had jon brion who scores the movie play live with us
9064558 we kind of lost steam but the first 20 minutes we did improvised song about what youre seeing
9064559 its not going to be some cheerleaders fighting this time
9064560 the speech ive heard my entire filmmaking life is that westerns are finished
9064561 we remind the company that having set an example with mike carlton it may need to sack all the undersigned if it insists on this course of action
9064562 we believe the company hires columnists on the basis that they have principles it is wrong to sack them for the same reason
9064563 mike is not a member of the sydney morning herald staff
9064564 its not a half decent product its a very decent product its as normal
9064565 well reserve our rights on all of that and well make decisions as things evolve
9064566 not the hard news not the international news not the business sport local news that is not the part of the business that is being affected at all
9064567 its really quite mischievous of people to say that theres going to be a decline in the quality
9064568 the planet is a very clever thing it can repair itself provided you dont go too far
9064569 the uae gets some of the highest amounts of light from the sun compared to anywhere in the world
9064570 its hypocritical for dale sweetland to on one hand criticize dan maffei for raising money and then to turn around and blatantly violate a simple election procedure that allows the public to see who is paying for elections
9064571 apparently he doesnt believe in transparency because the fec is very direct with candidates and they are serious about making sure all candidates are completely truthful when it comes to election financing
9064572 he recognizes the struggle that workers are having today for respect and dignity and social justice and he also recognizes our struggles to keep work in the united states and to fight these unfair trade agreements
9064573 it is time we move our country and our community in a new direction this is an unprecedented opportunity to invest in wind power which will not only improve our environment but will create new jobs and economic engines locally tomorrow the psc should approve iberdrolas bid and send the message that new york state has the right business climate for new investment in wind solar and biofuels
9064574 oil has gained 3 3 percent since gustav formed in the caribbean sea on aug 25
9064575 we have to invest now in wind solar and biofuels we have to diversify sources of energy to protect our economic security so that every time a storm forms somewhere prices at the pump dont go soaring tomorrow is the third anniversary of hurricane katrina the domestic symbol of failure of the bush administration we cannot forget the lessons we learned from the tragedy in new orleans invest in our infrastructure energy security is critical and our federal disaster response must improve dramatically
9064576 i spotted another truck near my home apparently they are coming from santa paula but instead of going through downtown via ojai avenue they cut north to grand avenue they head east turn onto west summer st
9064577 i tried to get a photo but it looks bad its hard to whip out a camera aim and shoot if youre not prepared to do it

9064580 egon bahr wojny o gruzj nie b dzie bo nikt tego nie chce
9064581 quiero hablar en nombre de los m s de 80 deportistas que fuimos a juegos ol mpicos con una ilusi n con un sue o a dar nuestro mejor esfuerzo sab amos que no iba a ser f cil que era un compromiso muy complicado pero quiero agradecerle a todo m xico que haya tenido confianza en nosotros quiz algunos se quedaron en el camino pero estoy seguro de que todos los que estuvimos en juegos ol mpicos fuimos a dar nuestro mayor esfuerzo
9064582 subir al podio de escuchar nuestro himno nacional y la verdad es un honor ser mexicano agradecerle el apoyo a carlos hermosillo al se or presidente que desde que es jefe de nuestro pa s nos ha motivado a dar nuestro mejor esfuerzo
9064583 if he had had the foresight to disregard their counsel and push for russias integration with nato how different history very probably would be today
9064584 with rising costs for food and fuel workers really need this boost
9064585 a fair minimum wage sends the message that we believe in the american work ethic that hard work should be a way out of poverty
9064586 the old minimum wage of 5 15 per hour was essentially meaningless by the time we passed this legislation in 2007
9064587 with inflation rising our decision to raise the minimum wage has proven critical if full time low wage workers are to have a shot at supporting themselves going forward
9064588 we are leveling the playing field with the rest of new england and recognizing the need to provide greater earning power to some of our most valuable workers including women who make up more than 60 percent of those earning the minimum wage in new hampshire
9064589 wages havent been increasing while prices for things like fuel and food have
9064590 those who were feeling stressed before the energy crisis are feeling even more stressed now
9064591 minimum wage hikes result in job loss for the most vulnerable members of the economy
9064592 the unintended consequences of julys federal hike is pricing low skilled working americans out of the job market and increasing unemployment among those groups that need help the most
9064593 small business people are working harder and longer hours and earning about the same as last year
9064594 as for the larger businesses corporate balance sheets are in much better shape than the finances of low income households
9064595 our working families are struggling to cope with the rapidly increasing costs of their basic needs especially gasoline heating fuel and food
9064596 this increase in the states minimum wage will help provide some relief for new hampshires hardworking families and will help to make new hampshire a place of opportunity for all of our citizens
9064597 the governor made raising the minimum wage a priority and with his support and the support of the legislature the increase in the minimum wage is making a positive impact on the lives of 17 000 of our citizens
9064598 y no lo hicieron por eso en el momento en que decidimos aumentar las tarifas es porque tenemos el fundamento legal
9064599 estoy dispuesto a cumplir la ley siempre y cuando tengan los argumentos legales a su alcance
9064600 if anyone whether within the school or out in the public if a student or a child thinks that a crime is being committed against them in any way they do need to contact the state police or at the very least go to one of the school officials and mae them aware

9064603 there are around 100 000 people from the subcontinent in the province of brescia and they want to play cricket so the council had to provide pitches to stop people being struck by cricket balls
9064604 i struggled to fit in when i arrived but i am now proud to represent italy
9064605 we get friends and family showing up and the odd curious italian while local sri lankan restaurants lay on fish and coconut curry
9064606 satellite tv in italy showed some cricket recently and italian friends said so is that the game youve been playing all this time
9064607 we have been discriminated against since the beginning for the simple fact of being women and indigenous women at that
9064608 men used to mock us but we have come further than male fighters
9064609 the system was made for us to be peasants all our lives
9064610 we have more space now but it is lamentable we were kept in the darkness for so long
9064611 there is still a lot of prejudice violence and physical control over women
9064612 it will take time but cholitas know they need to fight for their rights theres a resurgence of pride in the skirt
9064613 they train alongside men and we have seen that they can do a lot
9064614 but now we are united and advancing the idea is to show that women can do this on their own
9064615 but then after she became the champion and started touring abroad i started to feel very proud
9064616 it shows that in this country we all have the same rights
9064617 the cholitas are not equal to men they shouldnt be doing this its as simple as that
9064618 certainly the board hasnt given me that indication and neither have the shareholders
9064619 i will be guided by what they want right now i still think im the best person to get us through this point in time and get us to the other side
9064620 i know this business very well ive been doing it for 20 years and im very focused on the australian and new zealand businesses
9064621 we had new auditors this year and consequently again its just making sure we tick every box now especially with this increased scrutiny
9064622 the parents are still paying fees and the government still pays a fair portion so its a good operation
9064623 beverly hills 90210 actress shannen doherty has branded tori spelling a liar after she claimed the actress had engaged in a fistfight with co star jennie garth
9064624 i would estimate that about 90 were there and we were tightly packed
9064625 i hope to do a greensboro event every few months
9064626 i actually think if we deal with global warming in a way which raises peoples energy bills we will have blown
9064627 the novel conveys a powerful message and im so very thankful that i had the chance to read it

9064630 desde maio que estou sem jogar e treinar com o grupo ent o preciso de tempo e muito treino para estar 100 fisicamente e com ritmo de futebol e depois quando esse momento chegar a terei a possibilidade de atuar
9064631 we need to get ourselves in the chase that is goal no 1 to do that we need to have good finishes we need to run well we need to compete at a high level and we need to get the best finish that we can we certainly dont want to put ourselves in a situation that we didnt have to be in because i did something silly or we had a mechanical problem but at the same time you have to compete at a high level the competition is too tough so we are going to go out and try to win the race if we cant win the race then we are going to try to finish second if we cant finish second then we are going to try to finish third that is what we try to do every week
9064632 i think we played our best football at 2 0 unfortunately it was a warm night and so i think my players did ok under the circumstances
9064633 i thought tevez was outstanding probably the best player on the park and i thought we had the chances to do something in the game
9064634 but zenit are a very good team and they have exceptional movement theyll be a force in the champions league playing like that
9064635 als je gelukkig bent en je weet het denk dan opnieuw
9064636 a few days ago a long time friend of mine called me to let me know that he may have some positive video game related news for me and i said ok shoot he told me that his brother had gotten his cod4 disk stuck in his recently purchased ps3 and that the system would not eject it so he decided to give a ring to sonys customer service line he explained the situation to a supervisor and was told that it would all be taken care of immediately what sony did next was pretty amazing
9064637 its what you learn after you know it all that counts
9064638 coming to the knicks and hopefully being able to contribute means a lot to me
9064639 it has always been my dream to play for this team my goal is to show the coaches that i can play and do all that i can to help the team win some games
9064640 i am very happy my son will follow in my footsteps

9064642 patrick ewing will have an opportunity here to compete for a spot on our roster
9064643 he is a solid defensive player and a very good athlete
9064644 am very hard to please when it comes to food
9064645 god said he would make your path straight he promised it so when every christian in the world makes many wrong turns all god has to do is rotate the universe a few billion times a day to make our paths straight
9064646 the lord is not slow in keeping his promise s as some understand slowness he is patient with you not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance
9064647 maybe this is the day my prophecy comes true though its not my own birthday
9064648 folks look given this pick and all i have learned about what would happen with a democratic victory we have no choice but to enthusiastically work for the mccain palin ticket

9064657 i think we have a lot of research on our side of the best place for the school we have put together cash to be able to offer marshall a cash buy and we also have a very good chance of a school building authority grant that will put a green school on that site one with energy efficiencies that will last for 100 years or more
9064658 it will allow us to consolidate our addictions treatment programs which also will allow us to serve more people
9064659 the deepest weve ever been is 7 miles with a two inch drill bit

9064661 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9064662 bgp has far fewer potential attackers fewer necessary defenders is a much less agile attack and is way easier to monitor forensically and indeed with companies like renesys is being monitored forensically but so what it can work and when it does it can do much of the same damage we were afraid of via dns
9064663 it looked like they were probably three or four week old pit bull puppies gray and white
9064664 a couple of the workers smelled something the other day i guess the wind was going a different direction
9064665 if youre able to give us information about who may have had some puppies they were trying to part with and with a crate similar to that
9064666 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9064667 is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency given sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgment it shows political panic
9064668 i was being tested by everybody at ysl even the receptionist they all hated tom and they were all telling me about mr saint laurent and what he used to do
9064669 he always had girlfriends and i thought stefano was open to anything but that may have been wishful thinking on my part

9064679 the centre of gustav will pass near or over the cayman islands later today friday over the western portions of cuba on saturday and into the southern gulf of mexico on sunday
9064680 gustav could become a major hurricane before reaching western cuba
9064681 it is total devastation everywhere several residents are now crammed into disaster shelters here in east portland and the weather continues to make the situation worse
9064682 it was a fantastic club i enjoyed working with the manager and they are a great bunch of lads
9064683 but i knew offers had come in over the summer and the club had turned them down and the valuation of me wasnt reflected in the deal i was on
9064684 speaking to them i felt it was the right thing to put in a transfer request to show how i felt seeing as they didnt think they were on the same wavelength as me and they then made the decision to sell me
9064685 our commitment to building a new world class liverpool football club stadium is undiminished
9064686 like many other major development projects in the uk and overseas we are affected by global market conditions and as such work on the project will be delayed in the short term we will use this period productively and revisit the plans for the stadium to increase its capacity to 73 000 seats
9064687 currently we only have one official big ten channel theres no current solid plans of adding any extra overflow channels at this moment to your lineup

9064696 data from an air force reconnaissance aircraft indicate that gustav has again become a hurricane with maximum winds near 75 miles 120 kilometers per hour
9064697 preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion
9064698 on this track the center of gustav will pass near or over the cayman islands later friday over the western portions of cuba on saturday and into the southern gulf of mexico on sunday
9064699 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
9064700 we are doing everything we can so druzhba the main oil pipeline to europe can keep working stably and supply european consumers with enough oil
9064701 are arguably the worst they have been in 60 years
9064702 and i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9064703 this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9064704 in the space of 10 months weve gone from a position where people generally felt we were doing ok to where were certainly not doing ok
9064705 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won us three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment people are p off with us
9064706 i was at a filling station recently and a chap said i know its to do with oil prices but what are you going to do about it people think well surely you can do something you are responsible so of course it reflects on me
9064707 i just thought this is a disaster this is terrible i phoned gordon up we knew it was bad
9064708 after the current government is ousted we will propose a totally new political system with those corrupt guys prosecuted and we will have a clean and efficient political system

9064719 i can see now how one thing connects to the others
9064720 it just made me want to cry i knew deep down inside that that was something i should have done for them
9064721 you have my heart its who you are you are a good person youre a good at heart person thats whats going to save you
9064722 there is also the matter of being picked just because she has a vagina
9064723 every song is different from every other song but i do think there is a very powerful emotional content in every song im a great believer in variety in music and so are the other guys
9064724 i really dont want to say anything because i feel like he wins he being the man who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible i know i am being used i am just a pawn easy to sacrifice in order to feed his addiction i was angry when i first read his attack on me but for me i believe that actions speak louder than words so now i just pity him i am not standing in his way i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter he is his need to throw a tantrum for the whole world to hear is i am not going to go into a play by play defense i feel no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him p s im not the one that is so lost that i need to use my relationship with lindsay to earn a living i am always will and always have been here for her for her not for anything else so i think its safe to say that there is not now and never will be a tell all written by me when does your book come out mr lohan
9064725 whos out of control whose life is out of control give me a break going from place to place being dragged around by samantha so she can make more money off of lindsay being there when she spins shes gone from making 7 million to less than a million a movie whos out of control i go to church
9064726 it was good a nice track and a great crowd

9064728 my coach told me that i should make sure to end the season healthy

9064730 it was no revenge for me because i beat myself in beijing i wasnt beaten by the other girls in a clean race
9064731 senator mccains choice for a running mate is beyond belief by choosing sarah palin mccain has clearly made a decision to continue the bush legacy of destructive environmental policies
9064732 sarah palin whose husband works for bp formerly british petroleum has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment
9064733 this is senator mccains first significant choice in building his executive team and its a bad one it has to raise serious doubts in the minds of voters about john mccains commitment to conservation to addressing the impacts of global warming and to ensuring our country ends its dependency on oil
9064734 id like to win the game for one the other thing is id like for us to look decent it seems that the consensus is that we were decent in the jets game even though we lost that one id like to look decent against the bears and go from there

9064739 i would love to be a part of clevelands organization and help them get to that next level
9064740 usually in the preseason this is a screen pass situation
9064741 only time will tell with that one there are a lot of things that go into it what we think about the guys we have and things like that sometimes finances get involved so you just take each situation differently and day by day and see
9064742 any team with a superstar could clear cap space and use that same approach with bird rights
9064743 oh i might just happen to have some change at the bottom of my bag
9064744 the time it takes to execute evacuations for special needs patients we have to start before we have a clear idea about where landfall may occur
9064745 we have people with emergency room experience doctors nurses administrative a variety of people civil engineers everything we could think of we thew in a big pile and brought down here
9064746 we are voting to reject and recommending yes to strike
9064747 this is the best we can do its our best and final offer
9064748 based on our discussions with the union we believe the proposal addresses most of the important issues
9064749 we think boeing has done much to avoid a strike which would be quite costly to both parties
9064750 from what i can see it does look like it should have a good chance of satisfying enough of the workers that it decreases the odds of a strike
9064751 i hope that this action will act as a wake up call
9064752 we are in the same ballpark as the other finalist states
9064753 there is nothing wrong with that there is nothing with a larger economic effect in the south than an auto plant you cant put a value on that
9064754 youre not gonna be able to save yourself next week
9064755 that was a bit harsh and immature to say the least alex makes himself and the movement against the new world order look bad by behaving in such a radical manner

9064767 for you yourselves know brothers that our coming to you was not in vain but though we had already suffered and been shamefully treated at philippi as you know we had boldness in our god to declare to you the gospel of god in the midst of much conflict for our appeal does not spring from error or impurity or any attempt to deceive but just as we have been approved by god to be entrusted with the gospel so we speak not to please man but to please god who tests our hearts

9064783 i have watched with keen interest and renewed hope as your campaign has mobilized millions of americans behind your message of changing a political system that serves a small economic elite at the expense of the peoples of the united states and the world your election as president of the united states where slaves and indians were long considered less than human under the law will undoubtedly constitute a historic moment in race relations in the united states yet symbolism alone will not bring about change
9064784 i deeply regret all the wonderful things in life that i have missed but i will never regret standing up for my people for as long as i can draw my breath my heart is with them always and my heart is with you today

9064791 die juden wurden in schweine in affen und in ratten verwandelt so steht es auch im koran
9064792 ihr kennt doch diejenigen unter euch die sich hinsichtlich des sabbats vergingen und zu denen wir sprachen werdet wie ausgesto ene affen
9064793 sprich kann ich euch etwas schlimmeres verk nden als das was euer lohn bei allah ist wen allah verflucht hat und wem er z rnt und wen er in affen und schweine verwandelt hat und wer den g tzen dient die befinden sich in schlimmem zustand und sind vom rechten weg weit abgeirrt
9064794 und als sie trotzig bei dem verbotenen verharrten sprachen wir zu ihnen seid wie ver chtliche affen
9064795 113 sie die leute der schriften sind aber nicht alle gleich unter den leuten der schrift gibt es eine aufrechte gemeinde welche die verse allahs zur zeit der nacht liest und sich niederwirft 114 diese glauben an allah und an den j ngsten tag und gebieten das rechte und verbieten das unrechte und wetteifern in guten werken und sie geh ren zu den rechtschaffenen
9064796 und wir zerstreuten sie in gruppen auf der ganzen erde unter ihnen sind rechtschaffene und solche die es nicht sind und wir suchten sie mit gutem und b sem heim auf da sie zur ckkehrten
9064797 schlimmer als das vieh sind vor allah die ungl ubigen ja wo ist das problem das ist g ttliche offenbarung und so ist es was willst du da gro sagen
9064798 gott sagt dass das schlimmste was auf dieser erde wandelt
9064799 also dass f r allah zu sterben das gr te ist was einem moslem passieren kann dar ber gibt es berhaupt keinen zweifel
9064800 und bek mpft auf allahs pfad wer euch bek mpft doch bertretet nicht siehe allah liebt nicht die bertreter

9064803 w rdet ihr nicht s ndigen w rde euch gott verschwinden lassen und w rde ein volk schicken die s ndigen gott dann um vergebung bitten damit er ihnen verzeiht
9064804 gebt ihr ihnen insgeheim zuneigung zu verstehen w hrend ich doch am besten wei was ihr verbergt und was ihr kundtut

9064807 a group of israelites were lost nobody knows what they did but i do not see them except that they were cursed and changed into rats for if you put the milk of a she camel in front of a rat it will not drink it but if the milk of a sheep is put in front of it it will drink it
9064808 das schlimmste b seste was auf erden wandelt sind die ungl ubigen
9064809 die kofferbomber sie tun mir ein bisschen leid weil sie versuchen einfach nach den grunds tzen ihrer religion zu handeln und zu leben sie f rchten nicht die ungl ubigen sondern sie versuchen den islam zum sieg zu verhelfen

9064811 im deeply convinced this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community when it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me it is therefore very hard for me to express my standpoint on anything before this is cleared up i have stopped using a false name and i think all parties should do the same
9064812 i shall therefore enter on your behalf a plea of not guilty is that the position you are going to take in relation to each of the other ten charges on the indictment
9064813 i shall therefore enter pleas of not guilty in respect of each of the other charges on the indictment in other words your plea is one of not guilty to the indictment as a whole the registry will set a date for your trial in due course please be seated

9064815 i will never give an order to start a military operation i do not want people to die since blood in the caucasus means blood not even for decades but for centuries
9064816 weve done everything we entered victoria crater to do and more
9064817 our experience tells us theres lots of diversity among the cobbles
9064818 we want to get a better characterization of them a statistical sampling from examining more of them will be important for understanding the geology of the area
9064819 the patterns broadly resemble what we saw at the smaller craters opportunity explored earlier
9064820 by looking deeper into the layering we are looking farther back in time
9064821 if opportunity were driving with only five wheels like spirit it probably would never get out of victoria crater
9064822 we also know from experience with spirit that if opportunity were to lose the use of a wheel after it is out on the level ground mobility should not be a problem
9064823 both rovers show signs of aging but they are both still capable of exciting exploration and scientific discovery
9064824 remember when pat buchanan ran a number of hard right fringe campaigns for president in the late 1980s 1990s and 2000 well guess who was supporting him

9064831 what we want is new ways of thinking about the opening ceremony
9064832 we want the whole of london to be involved with different parts of london taking part in the ceremony the london games must be deeply democratic with the citys citizens feeling theyre intimately involved i think what you will see is a very vivid sense of celebration right across the city at both the opening and closing ceremonies
9064833 we want to create the expectation that seats will have people on them
9064834 you cant stop sponsors buying seats nor should you but we must maximise the publics chances of seeing the games first hand
9064835 in terms of great organisation fantastic facilities and a welcoming attitude and pride among the people beijing was superb
9064836 but there are things we can and will do better i saw lots and lots of chinese people standing outside stadiums on the wrong part of a perimeter fence as observers rather than participants we must reverse that trend and make sure our olympics are more accessible i also want to minimise the number of empty seats in stadiums which frustrate the public and keep them at a distance for no reason and i want our volunteers to be trained better and given a more clearly defined role
9064837 we cannot commit to such ideas at this stage but the principle of getting more people to museums and increasing access to londons cultural heritage we endorse
9064838 at the moment were in dialogue with the nhs and we hope to come to a satisfactory outcome
9064839 im only here once and i intend to make the most of it
9064840 during the 2006 war we considered the possibility of attacking lebanons infrastructure but we never sic resorted to this option because we thought at the time that not all the lebanese were responsible for the hizbollah attacks at that time we had hizbollah in our sights and not the lebanese state but the hizbollah do not live on the moon and some sic infrastructure was hit
9064841 its extremely important just to keep making forward progress rather than trying prematurely to come to some set of conclusions
9064842 bidens being set up to protect israel while obama looks after the transportation system in chicago
9064843 if saintly men like gandhi could choose to clean latrines and thomas more could voluntarily wear a hair shirt this experience wont kill me
9064844 the special properties of the colour green and on the fact that wisteria rhymes with hysteria
9064845 i owe him much because he was a very loyal friend and supporter but he said once that one of the problems about the criticism of vuillards work was that so much of it was written in toilet water john was very determined to make his own criticism as valuable as possible which meant never selling an artist short by conferring easy or less than deserved praise on his work
9064846 in its cumulative effect this may well in fact be one of the most debilitating hyped up and deeply offensive exhibitions of the postwar era this is not because the work is bad but because it does not reach that level of achievement at which the words bad and good have any meaning
9064847 people of different backgrounds didnt feel at ease in being part of this
9064848 i didnt know he was dead until i came into the pits at the end
9064849 i said hows trips i knew it was him because we got an order board soon after the accident and he was missing from it i saw the way carlo chiti evaded my question and i just knew right then
9064850 we got along fine but we were very different types
9064851 trips was much more extrovert than i was for one thing and he knew nothing about cars except how to drive them at ferrari they really liked that because back then they didnt think it was the drivers place to do anything else
9064852 all year long it was him or me for the championship and if wed been really close friends it would have been a hell of a lot harder to be sufficiently competitive with him face it its not a normal situation race drivers are in you try to beat the other guys all day and then at night youre supposed to forget all that
9064853 at tripss reception all of a sudden mrs ferrari said pheeleel are you going back now
9064854 fortunately for us that 404 had very high backs to the seats were going along back to modena and all of a sudden richie says duck duck instinctively i just did what he said he says its the old lady and were supposed to be in stockholm
9064855 the next day we get to the factory and theres manicardi i said christ richie saw you at the last second i didnt even see you i just ducked and manicardi told us that mrs ferrari had said manicardi isnt that pheeleels car he said i dont know theres nobody in it and she just said oh thats all right then that was what it was like living with mrs ferrari
9064856 whatever else no one could be accused back then of doing it for the money
9064857 for one thing there wasnt any for another it was so dangerous back then youd have had to be crazy to do it unless it was something you had to do
9064858 this generation has always made it up as it went along even at the age of 60 they are just as likely to overthrow the convention of marriage as they have done to so many others all their lives they think do i want to spend the rest of my life like this and often decide that they dont they realise they only have one life and that this is their moment
9064859 people in their 60s are really very youthful and full of energy nowadays and i dont think that theyre prepared to compromise in their private lives they might have been married to somebody for 30 years and have had children with them but that doesnt mean theyll think that its a good enough reason for spending the next 30 with them
9064860 i dont know a lot of other people my age who its happened to but i do know some i suppose at one time people stayed in marriages that they were bored with because they couldnt do much about it whereas now they can afford to go through with it and start again
9064861 the most light elegant and pleasing building i ever beheld
9064862 its fictional but a couple of scenes are direct translations of something i experienced and saw
9064863 most of the movies that hollywood has made on iraq have primarily been polemical and dealt with the home front the consequences of coming back and reintegrating the hurt locker is really different it takes place exclusively in the country and its more like a classical vietnam war movie like full metal jacket an ied improvised explosive device is a key signature of the war the way that the jungle was in vietnam
9064864 i went on missions with these guys every day they had a variety of techniques including hi tech robots but when i was there there were just too many bombs so that it was a trade off whether to take a hi tech approach to it or run in with very little equipment to defuse it quickly
9064865 normal life starts to seem really boring in comparison i visited some of them after they had come back to the united states they were talking about wishing they could go back they werent excited to be home
9064866 he told me stories about men in the army who disarm bombs in the heat of combat when he mentioned that they are extremely vulnerable and use little more than a pair of pliers to disarm a bomb that can kill for 300 metres i was shocked when i learned that these men volunteer for this dangerous work and often grow so fond of it that they can imagine doing nothing else i knew i had found my next film
9064867 the lead actors all had extensive training with us army soldiers as part of the research for their roles jeremy spent time at fort irwin in california which is the premier anti ied facility in the us working with us army bomb technicians whod just returned from iraq
9064868 he participated in live fire training exercises with real explosives learned to operate the bomb suit and the robots and became friends with several of the bomb techs
9064869 once in jordan before and during the shoot we ran more training courses for the actors with several technical advisers who had spent time fighting in iraq men from the us navy seals and british sas and in these courses they worked on bomb skills and basic soldiering skills as well such as how to shoot various carbines and sniper rifles
9064870 we got shot at a few times while we were filming i can almost say i was in a war but to be honest i was just some jerk ass actor pretending i was in it
9064871 i dont think there has been a true iraq movie yet
9064872 these places were far more organised than your average medieval town
9064873 was looking for stone cities he was looking for athens
9064874 i am georgiana i am not diana the film is not about diana
9064875 the marketing people probably thought the only way they could get the young popcorn eating brigade to see this film was if they made some comparison with diana
9064876 i dont actually think that georgiana died in a carriage crash
9064877 we didnt want to make any parallels between the two women whatsoever
9064878 if you see someone drowning for example or if youre drowning yourself
9064879 a beautiful woman a superb athlete flying into the night sky soaring like a human spirit a perfect symbol of the hope we have for ourselves and for the world
9064880 she loved to go shopping if she would buy one thing she would buy five
9064881 i only saw him on the weekends and i didnt want him to come home to this woman who couldnt do anything
9064882 i completely masked it and completely kept myself somewhat pain free and with the ability to function and do everything he wanted
9064883 she told me many times that she wanted to be the perfect wife and mother and she wanted to be everything that john mccain wanted her to be
9064884 and she pretty much was the perfect wife and mother but you know she had to come to the realisation that everything isnt perfect
9064885 my children and i not only trust my husband but know that he would never do anything to not only disappoint our family but disappoint the people of america
9064886 i was mainly more concerned about being caught in public without my full faculties
9064887 so i grabbed my car keys and fortunately my friends grabbed my car keys away from me and said no theres something wrong with you
9064888 john was with me the first time i lost a baby
9064889 i keep a long list you know i have a grudge list husband johns taught me to leave my grudge list behind
9064890 shes the one who everyone says why isnt she the candidate
9064891 for a tiny child the mmr is a ridiculous thing to do it has definitely caused autism

9064899 i cant hear you well im im im on a boat
9064900 ive been on an island ill come back to you i wont give up
9064901 above all the speech reflects on the role of the presidency and the qualities that are demanded by the job and makes the case that john mccain is the best qualified to be our next leader and commander in chief said spokeswoman dana perino
9064902 do not expect the speech to define the presidents legacy ms perino cautioned
9064903 this is not an opportunity to recap accomplishments over the past seven and a half years
9064904 it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama she underlined
9064905 the major issues facing the country from terrorism and war to the economy and the direction of our culture but the speech also
9064906 the president will thank his family his administration and most of all the friends supporters and volunteers in the convention hall who have supported him and the republican agenda for these past eight years
9064907 some of the attacks are just out and out false for example suggesting that the bush administration hasnt invested in alternative or renewable energies
9064908 were going down off roading with our jeeps and instead of towing were packing up the jeep and stuck driving it ourselves
9064909 instead of having that insurance policy being able to tow it home its kind of a risk but its cheaper
9064910 not just gas prices but all the extra fees that people are having to pay now
9064911 whether its for extra baggage if you want food or drink on the plane i think all of those things are really factoring in peoples decisions they are looking at those things very closely when they are deciding where they are going on vacation and when theyre going to go
9064912 jes s muri en la cruz en el mismo momento en el que en el templo se sacrificaban los corderos pascuales
9064913 transmiten fielmente lo que jes s hijo de dios viviendo entre los hombres hizo y ense
9064914 tienen origen apost lico pues lo que los ap stoles predicaron por mandato de cristo luego bajo la inspiraci n del esp ritu santo ellos mismos y los varones apost licos nos lo transmitieron por escrito
9064915 la lucha entre lo que crees y lo que razonas podr a ser la puerta para entender la verdad
9064916 and i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9064917 weve got our work cut out this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the
9064918 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment people are pissed off with us
9064919 nobody knew about his announcement this morning except a traveling aide and the governors chief of staff who found out about this last night
9064920 the fundamental principle behind any selection of a running mate would be whether that person is fully prepared to take over and shares your values your principles your philosophy and your priorities
9064921 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice
9064922 and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
9064923 john mccain followed her career and admired her tenacity and her many accomplishments
9064924 she was scheduled for a high profile speaking role at our convention and included in the vp selection process because of his admiration for her strong reform credentials
9064925 she gave a slightly different answer and left the door slightly open as opposed to shutting down all the speculation up front
9064926 you have to know that youre going to have a good time but we ask that you dont bring coolers or chairs or picnic baskets and thats just for safety reasons
9064927 in between the stadiums historically in the past those have all been closed and theyll all be open this year so thats new parking

9064938 everything came out the word would be awesome from our standpoint
9064939 everything was clean there were a number of tests and josh came thought with flying colours obviously we hoped for that we needed to get some closure
9064940 nurses dont want to see moms and babies being sent out of the province for care so they want their units staffed adequately so they can provide care
9064941 eastern health has scheduled 14 mandatory overtime shifts at the neonatal intensive care unit for the next week alone while employers are entitled to mandate overtime if no other nurse is available scheduling it in advance as a solution to the nursing shortage is both inappropriate and unsustainable
9064942 while the employer will argue they may cancel the scheduled shifts if they determine they are not required these nurses are unfairly left hanging in the balance until the very last minute
9064943 all we feel is that if we have our questions answered we have the policemens version we will feel a little bit better
9064944 it still wont bring quilem back but if we have justice then maybe we will feel a little bit better
9064945 if they would have taken the time to use better judgment maybe the situation would have been different
9064946 were asking for a public inquiry to re evaluate the entire situation
9064947 we have to teach the police officers that the taser is not an inoffensive weapon
9064948 i think that until we have serious studies on intoxicated or sick persons that are conclusive the taser should also be considered as a weapon that can lead to death
9064949 we are continuing to alert the public given that the elderly people with weakened immune systems and pregnant women are at increased risk and are frequent patients at our facilities
9064950 well be placing a special emphasis this weekend on impaired driving and speeding those are the two leading causes of collisions and fatalities in this area
9064951 we tell our staff and our door guys to just keep an eye on whose coming in who is leaving the condition that they seem to be in its a real big issue when you have a town such as wilmington
9064952 i usually either get someone to drive for me or i dont drive
9064953 the real tragedy is people arent learning from their mistakes apparently people arent getting the message even though we continue to arrest a tremendous number of people
9064954 that it when life begins shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
9064955 misrepresented both the writings of st augustine and the settled doctrine of the catholic church in an attempt to justify uncertainty about when human life begins and thus to defend a right to abortion
9064956 that in an age that prides itself on scientific knowledge there are those whose agenda drives them to invoke misinformed theology to cast doubt on some of the most basic biological truths
9064957 in such a politicized environment of self serving skepticism and slogans about choice the church must tirelessly proclaim the truth about the dignity of the human person from conception to natural death this is all the more urgent when innocent human life is threatened as it is by abortion as well as embryonic stem cell research and euthanasia
9064958 on behalf of the 650 000 catholics of this archdiocese i wish to reinforce what cardinal rigali bishop lori of bridgeport conn and archbishop chaput of denver have said about speaker pelosis misinterpretation on the question of when life begins
9064959 the church has taught for centuries that life begins at conception and there is no room for misrepresentation of that teaching in addition modern medical techniques have been able to confirm what the church has already known
9064960 surely there may be some catholic politicians who will take a different interpretation of this church doctrine during the coming election campaign but speaker pelosis remarks underscore once again the need for catholics and especially catholic politicians to form their consciences according to the moral truths taught by the catholic church
9064961 be providing leadership in a civilized democracy worthy of the name
9064962 rectify your errant claims and apologize for misrepresenting the churchs doctrine and misleading fellow catholics
9064963 we wish you would have made a more honest effort to lay out the authentic position of the church on this core moral issue before attempting to address it with authority
9064964 your subsequent remarks mangle catholic church doctrine regarding the inherent sanctity and dignity of human life therefore we are compelled to refute your error
9064965 finding information on the web can be difficult if you dont know where to start looking for many people wisia will be a place to gain valuable insight from other people
9064966 with yahoo answers one answer is selected as a favorite and the emphasis is on the quality of textual response and the answers ability to sell their answer over the other people who answer wisia is different rather than one answer wisia coordinates multiple answers sites or responses and allows the community to vote for the answers that they like best
9064967 i can see wisia doing well for a couple different reasons first of all they have a rating system that gives people wisdom points a point based system keeps people engaged for wisia to be successful they need lots of community engagement second of all they offer value to the visitor

9064970 you cant be president the outrageous barriers to democracy in america
9064971 a news and media blog in the libertarian tenor with limited government overtones facilitating the flow of ideas information e commerce and inspiration within the internet freedom of net neutrality
9064972 my reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government
9064973 commerce with all nations alliance with none should be our motto
9064974 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
9064975 the happy union of these states is a wonder their constitution a miracle their example the hope of liberty throughout the world
9064976 the constitution is the guide which i never will abandon
9064977 a bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government and what no just government should refuse or rest on inference
9064978 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
9064979 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
9064980 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
9064981 for the russians to say they are not responsible for what happened in georgia is ludicrous russia is to blame for this crisis and the world is responding to what russia has done
9064982 americans wishing to spend august vacationing with their families or watching the olympics may wonder why their newspapers and television screens are filled with images of war in the small country of georgia
9064983 knows that the thoughts and prayers and support of the american people are with that brave little nation as they struggle today for their freedom and independence he wanted me to say thank you to give you his heartfelt thanks for the support of the american people
9064984 that i know i speak for every american when i say to him today we are all georgians
9064985 nunca la he conocido parece ser alguien fascinante con una historia personal extraordinaria
9064986 im still going to be doing a lot of stuff for the mayor i expect to be around not every day but a lot
9064987 i didnt want to have to feel guilty or to have to struggle to balance my vacation time with the citys needs
9064988 law school is more flexible thats one of the things they pay me to do do go around talking about my work
9064989 there was concern that there would be a large number of people doing business in the bellevue
9064990 theres got to be a lot of other neutral territory around town other than a highly influential connected law firm they can always come to my office
9064991 as it pertains to philly live the new mutli entertainment complex that we are adding to the wachovia complex in a partnership with cordish company our plans do not call for a casino and we are not considering one for the site
9064992 if south philadelphia doesnt want it theres no way id want it up in bridesburg
9064993 i dont believe the people of bridesburg would appreciate it any more than i would i would never support something like that
9064994 certainly being associated with the organization makes that a lot more possible there have been conversations for a lot of years about me being part of a performance at a super bowl
9064995 im hoping that this leads definitely to that this whole process is basically you scratch my back ill scratch yours
9064996 the greatest end zone dance of all time has to be cuba gooding jr
9064997 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country then recognizing part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9064998 it wasnt a georgian attack on tskhinvali that launched all of this
9064999 it was russian pressure over a long period of time and then shelling coming from south ossetians
9065000 was not a wise thing to do because as weve seen russia was prepared to launch a major invasion
9065001 today it is a fight between the civilized and the uncivilized worlds
9065002 i have found the right partner to help me stand up to those who value their privileges over their responsibilities who put power over principle and put their interests before your needs
9065003 it turns out that the women of america arent finished yet
9065004 and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9065005 if you want change in washington if you hope for a better america were asking for your vote
9065006 john mccain has made his candidacy about a single argument experience and sarah palin doesnt have it
9065007 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
9065008 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9065009 what the people heard people of every creed and colour from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
9065010 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat
9065011 i think god is reminding us that on the eve of katrina god can bring nature back
9065012 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9065013 her selection is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9065014 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9065015 she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same
9065016 is one more indicator of this country moving forward the fact that youve got a woman
9065017 vice presidential nominee of one of the major parties i think is one more hit against that glass ceiling
9065018 even if the use of the taser by the police cannot be considered to be the medical cause of death it is apparent that considering he was in an agitated and intoxicated state receiving several electrical discharges possibly contributed to his death
9065019 all we feel is that if we have our questions answered and we have the policemens version we will feel a little bit better
9065020 it still wont bring quilem back but if we have justice then maybe we will feel a little bit better
9065021 if they would have taken the time to use better judgment maybe the situation would have been different
9065022 were asking for a public inquiry to re evaluate the entire situation
9065023 the officers should have been capable of profiting from the window of opportunity from the first discharge to bring the suspect under control
9065024 its not normal that it would take six charges to subdue him
9065025 i think that until we have serious studies on intoxicated or sick persons that are conclusive the taser should also be considered as a weapon that can lead to death
9065026 we have to ask for justice thats the only thing we can do right now and thats what quilem would have wanted
9065027 we ask them to go away and take language courses and reapply
9065028 i would be one of the people that would say this is not morally correct
9065029 not speaking english does not exclude one from good manners does not exclude one from being a very good golf player so if youre really worried about rules and regulations theres definitely some other ways of getting around this
9065030 in essence any so called private club in b c which has a bona fide membership selection process in place is not covered by the human rights act and is permitted to discriminate on grounds that would otherwise be prohibited i e sex race religion etc
9065031 one of our mandates is to promote and grow the game and the best way to do that is to try and be as welcoming as possible
9065032 there isnt a legal remedy to this problem but i think that everyone has to acknowledge this is exclusionary and on its face discriminatory
9065033 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9065034 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9065035 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9065036 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9065037 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9065038 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9065039 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency
9065040 the prime ministers legal actions are an attempt to use the courts to interfere with the official oppositions freedom of political expression and thereby give his party an advantage over his principal political opponents
9065041 such an injection of legal action into our political debates were it to succeed would give the government party a political advantage over its opponents
9065042 well the recalls therell be a few more as we get out into the secondary processors and some of the third line
9065043 some of this product went out somewhere and other sandwiches were made out of it thats the nature of the recalls as they grow
9065044 the most important information for consumers is as we go out there we are providing further precision that informs them and lets them recognize these products in ways they werent able to do with the initial recall
9065045 it certainly does shake the confidence of consumers to know that its taking this amount of time
9065046 it just demonstrates that our need to make sure that we have absolute vigilance throughout this process is paramount
9065047 in the u s they had a legislated commitment to visit the plants daily
9065048 we took a different approach originally which meant that those tasks were applied by the inspectors spending more time in the plants though not necessarily on a daily basis
9065049 with our system we were able to pick it up with relatively small numbers otherwise it might have gone unnoticed
9065050 it helped us to connect the dots in such a way that we were able to say we have something provincially going on

9065122 i think she brings a lot of enthusiasm and she brings truly what most of us who know her understand is a common background
9065123 it was a bit of a surprise for me this morning to learn that senator mccain had selected her
9065124 i wasnt really in favor of her i kind of like mitt romney
9065125 but after hearing her she brought tears to my eyes and i thought well i have chills just now thinking about her
9065126 i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that
9065127 i believe in his mccain ideals and his proposals to lead this nation hes been a fighter for the hispanic community

9065134 already in use in circuit courts around st louis and kansas city as well as the missouri supreme court and court of appeals the missouri plan does not require judges to run in partisan elections
9065135 we have a special judicial system already built into our state constitution that started with efforts made back in 1940 when missourians voted to keep politics and special interests out of the courtrooms of the supreme court the court of appeals and the trial courts in jackson county and the city of st louis three other missouri counties adopted the nonpartisan court plan in early 1970s and now greene county has the chance to do so as well
9065136 our analysis finds no other method of selection resulting in average scores or rankings that are statistically higher than missouris current system
9065137 the system has worked very well for missourians taking some of the politics out of judgeships and efficiently filling vacancies
9065138 raised to new prominence the simmering dispute over the true non partisanship of the missouri plan
9065139 allies of governor matt blunt feel that the current appellate judicial commission has not fairly recognized the fact that he not the commission is the elected leader of missouri the current make up of both the commission and its recently selected panel which many conservatives feel is tilted toward the left seem to substantiate this charge this has led to calls from some legislators to do away with the missouri plan
9065140 17 of the last 18 nominees to the supreme court had been democrats
9065141 making the appointed positions term coincide with the governors own term would serve to respect the wishes of voters and whatever candidate they choose to elect
9065142 add ing one appointed position to each commission making the number of appointments equal to the number of judges and attorneys on the commission
9065143 the legislature should take steps to make it clear to all that the various judicial commissions actions are covered by the states sunshine law
9065144 the retention vote is a good practice but electoral history has shown it is almost impossible to get enough people to focus on the issue last year in saint louis county a judge was handily retained by voters when an overwhelming number of lawyers in a bar association survey had advised against retaining her a recommendation echoed by area newspapers perhaps we could improve the retention vote system by taking a page from illinois and mandating a 60 percent vote in favor of retention in order for a judge to remain in office i believe that is an idea worth debating

9065154 we are pleased to have linda join our team in hillsborough
9065155 she is a team player and a hard worker and she will be a delight to work with
9065156 she is smart vivacious and energetic she tends to oversimplify complex issues has had difficulty delegating authority and clearly has difficulty distinguishing the line between her public responsibilities and private wishes
9065157 her approval ratings are high 65 percent or so but down from 80 percent earlier in her term most alaskans havent watched her as closely as most reporters or legislators if you took a poll of reporters and legislators i expect her approval rating would be down in the teens or twenties
9065158 were disappointed we will be appealing on a myriad of issues and we are going to fight this all the way
9065159 obviously its been a rough year with the weather and losing nine events
9065160 the events we did run i think we put on great shows in a timely fashion the teams put on a great show for the fans
9065161 i wish we could have ran more races but the quality we had made for a racing season that people will talk about all winter
9065162 the neat thing about this year going into the final night is how close the championships are
9065163 we tried everything in the book to run the track in
9065164 i hate that it took five hours to make that decision but we were trying to race for the teams that were close in the nra points and do the right thing by everybody
9065165 our concern is we dont want to be out here late for our fans or our neighbors
9065166 in 11 years i thought i had seen most of it but obviously last week i hadnt

9065200 mr kanjorski is either afraid to debate lou barletta face to face or he knows his record is simply indefensible and he would rather hide than face voters in northeastern pennsylvania
9065201 in either case it clearly shows that paul kanjorski does not deserve another term representing the great people of the 11th congressional district
9065202 its a great honor to speak at any convention under any circumstances espcially in light of 1992 i think no matter what the circumstance or the history he would be proud
9065203 and last probably the most important is a simple gui system

9065206 a long time member of feminists for life and a mother of five children
9065207 palin proved her pro life credentials in a powerful way earlier this year year when she gave birth to her fifth child born with down syndrome despite receiving pressure from doctors to abort
9065208 we knew through early testing he would face special challenges and we feel privileged that god would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives we have faith that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential to make this world a better place we are truly blessed
9065209 is opposed to same sex marriage though she has said in the past that she has homosexual friends and shares their concerns about discrimination
9065210 yellow peril science fiction was never large enough to be a genre in and of itself but i decided it was worth traveling back in time to revisit the trend in its historical context
9065211 16 if you have a nosebleed you most definitely have cancer and you have no money to pay for the surgery that will save your life and your liver is missing were not sure where it went but its making your cancer progress faster
9065212 a brown university graduate and homeland security and terrorist financing expert
9065213 palin works hard to cripple the eco tourism industry in alaska
9065214 heres the dilemma and it was the same dilemma with frex which also runs outside the border of the rta do you use a federal air quality grant to launch a pilot program to see if takes single occupant vehicles off road
9065215 i was struggling to see the ball at the net a little bit with the crowd in the back
9065216 he did well to scramble back you know quite a few balls but i wasnt comfortable at the net from the start you know it just made it hard you know
9065217 i was never really in danger so it was actually pretty good for me
9065218 the vice president is a heartbeat away from becoming president so to choose someone with not one hours worth of experience on national issues is a dangerous choice
9065219 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken the only similarity between her and hillary clinton is that they are both women on the issues they could not be further apart
9065220 sen mccain had so many other options if he wanted to put a woman on his ticket such as sen kay bailey hutchison or sen olympia snowe they would have been an appropriate choice compared to this dangerous choice
9065221 one would expect bell and telus to want to be quite aggressive in being able to compete with rogers
9065222 so whats motivating it is wanting to lower the cost of acquiring handsets and accelerate the speed of getting the latest the coolest handsets
9065223 its still a question of how long it takes bell and telus to roll out a comparable network
9065224 so having high end devices is a key aspect of moving over to the new network but there are a lot of drawbacks to doing it
9065225 i think what is clear is that as it relates to 4g we will be going lte
9065226 your current report on the arrl website indicates that the tiny sunspot presently visible is from the old solar cycle the current mt wilson magnetogram data shows a dipole with the south pole leading the north which in the northern hemisphere indicates a new cycle spot
9065227 on the other hand those of us playing at 505 and 137 khz are quite delighted with the quiet sun a little kick every now and then to recharge the supply of free electrons and were all set the transatlantic stuff is much easier than it was 4 5 years ago oh well the pendulum will swing the other way with a vengeance im sure then youll be happy and ill be sad
9065228 i see we have been spotless now for 37 straight days which i think exceeds the number of spotless days in october of 2007 and could possibly exceed the 6 week period of spotless days we had in sept oct of 1996 possibly this month could set a double minimum in cycle 23 one thing that has really helped the bands in the last few days along with a and k indices of 0 2 is that the sun is void of any coronal disturbances big difference if we could get some cycle 24 spots we would surely be off and running as it has been said its darkest just b4 dawn
9065229 if you are in the affected area and normally monitor on a local net on vhf 40 or 80 meters we would appreciate your checking into the hwn net or echolink irlp net once per hour to receive the latest hurricane advisories and to report your local conditions please do not venture outside during the hurricane to gather weather data
9065230 the department of homeland securitys federal emergency management agency fema is coordinating plans and preparatory activities of numerous federal agencies in close communication with state tribal and local officials as tropical storm gustav threatens to return to hurricane strength prior to impacting gulf coast states
9065231 fema and its federal partners are in close communications with states along its potential path in order to review plans pre station assets and personnel and respond to any request for assistance femas work with states using a gap analysis tool to determine in advance of storms where federal assistance is most likely to be needed has helped federal and state agencies to develop pre scripted mission assignments and other contingency plans to help improve response and recovery efforts
9065232 i urge all mississippians to please take this storm seriously one of the most important lessons we learned after hurricane katrina was that there is no substitute for awareness and self help especially in the days before the hurricane is predicted to hit
9065233 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9065234 if you go back and look at our record weve been flawless with other government agencies
9065235 u s government is strongly opposed to restrictive trade practices or boycotts targeted against israel
9065236 are not of israeli origin nor do they contain any israeli
9065237 the anti boycott provisions of the export administration regulations ear apply to all
9065238 commerce under secretary for industry and security kenneth i juster today reiterated to u s companies that the department will vigorously enforce its regulations prohibiting u s persons from taking any action in support of foreign government boycotts against israel
9065239 as an experienced prosecutor john kroger is the right person to serve as oregons next attorney general i trust john to be a leader and work closely with oregon district attorneys to fight crime and make our communities safer he is committed to leading the fight against methamphetamine and those who prey on our elderly and vulnerable we need someone with johns personal integrity as our next attorney general
9065240 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9065241 created to arm people with arguments and facts that they could use to counter the propaganda of the boycott campaign within the association of university teachers
9065242 even with the system of permits even with the limits of movement to south africa we never had as much restriction on movement as i see for the people here
9065243 there are areas in which people would live their whole lifetime without visiting because its impossible
9065244 the issue of separate roads different registration of cars driven by different nationalities the indignity of producing a permit any time a soldier asks for it and of waiting in long queues in the boiling sun at checkpoints just to enter your own city i think is worse than what we experienced during apartheid
9065245 the daily indignity to which the palestinian population is subjected far outstrips the apartheid regime and the effectiveness with which the bureaucracy implements the repressive measures far exceed that of the apartheid regime
9065246 this is ridiculous why are they arresting our guides and leaving the man with the megaphone
9065247 these provocations didnt come from us im jewish and i look at this and i say to myself how can i feel fear from other jews
9065248 as you walk into yad vashem you see a quote that says in effect you should know a country not only by what it does but what it tolerates
9065249 so i found it very shocking to then come and here and see footage of teenagers heaping abuse on palestinian children as they come out of school and throwing stones at them and that this should be done in the name of judaism i find totally reprehensible
9065250 what the holocaust teaches us more than anything else is that we must never turn our heads away in the face of injustice
9065251 i wanted to cry i was filled with a blazing anger against a system that could do this to a child johnnys case alone ought to be enough to fill any decent person with revulsion and indignation

9065254 yet the israeli government does a very good job of convincing the whole world that it is the victim in the conflict
9065255 john in support to your link this may be a long but also an interesting reading www davidduke com general humanitarian disaster 595 html no comment necessary the facts are speaking for themselves jenna
9065256 there is much evidence to warrant an in depth investigation of the role played by agents of israel in the 9 11 attacks
9065257 just what level of power do israeli interests wield in the halls of power in the us that any investigation into israeli spying activities on us soil against us intelligence agencies can be so completely quashed
9065258 they were trying to take a current situation and get some training out of it
9065259 500 pound gorilla in israel well armed and trained operates in both gaza and the west bank known to disregard international law to accomplish mission very unlikely to fire on american forces fratricide a concern especially in air space management
9065260 wildcard ruthless and cunning has capability to target u s forces and make it look like a palestinian arab act
9065261 on the morning of 9 11 and just as the wtc towers were crumbling the five israelis were caught doing the happy dance as they videotaped the twin towers fall
9065262 either someone does something about these sick psychopaths or they and their kind in washington and around the world will destroy us all
9065263 since 2003 academic unions have been dominated by a campaign to exclude israelis and nobody else from uk campuses we have warned the ucu general secretary on numerous occasions that this campaign has imported anti semitic ways of thinking into our union she either didnt understand or didnt care that the union is now circulating racist material should be understood as a manifestation of its institutional anti semitism it cannot be written off as yet another random accident
9065264 the ucu is circulating links to david dukes website on behalf of delich
9065265 im not surprised that anti semitic material has again dropped into my inbox from the union activists list what is shocking is the failure of the unions internal procedures to do anything about this ucu prides itself on being an anti racist union in fact it is probably the most complacent public institution in britain in relation to increasing anti semitism and the leadership turns a blind eye or worse to the racism in the union behind all this is the campaign of discrimination against israeli academics which is fostered by some in the union and encouraged by the leadership
9065266 this is precisely the kind of thing which drove me recently to resign from the ucu it has become a union which is complacent about anti semitism it regards prejudicial hostility toward jews from within the union itself as something too unimportant for it to bother with i didnt feel able to remain in an institution which treats anti semitism indulgently as a special exception to a generally anti racist stance
9065267 anti semitism is routinely tolerated on the activist list when it is expressed in the language of hostility to israel
9065268 only a small group of jews and anti racists have been standing up against this culture on the list some have been excluded from the list on trumped up charges others have been driven off the list by continual accusations of bad faith some have left the union because they cannot bear to pay their dues to what they consider to be an anti semitic organization
9065269 criticism of israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as anti semitic

9065274 the way we played tonight was superb and we definitely deserved the victory
9065275 in fact i am surprised we did not score more goals we deserved to win by a bigger margin
9065276 tottenham did not offer the 22 million pounds 40 28 million we wanted for him and what we think he is worth they offered 16 million pounds and with respect that is not enough so thats the end of it
9065277 we played our best when we were 2 0 down
9065278 we put a good effort in it was a warm night and there are tired players out there

9065284 i had a chance to win at 4 1 and also at 4 2 but i missed a couple of balls he choked a bit you have put those chances away
9065285 he had his chances in the last frame but he missed a ball he should have potted that was the difference
9065286 i didnt play that well it was a tough match for both of us
9065287 i think my experience showed in the end i didnt take too many risky shots on
9065288 the black i missed at the end of the fifth frame was a tricky one it was similar to the last black in my 147 at the crucible
9065289 i just thought to myself that im glad i got the one for the maximum and missed this one rather than the other way around
9065290 i put it behind me straight away which is the difference between the way i am now and how i was before
9065291 im into another semi final and pushing on bit by bit im happy to have another crack at ronnie i wouldnt mind playing him in every tournament as you always learn something from him
9065292 i struggled for a bit its frustrating because the greens were good and i just was not really making anything
9065293 i finally hit one close on 12 and got the round finally going its nice to get off to a half decent start
9065294 i drove it well hit my irons well and i felt like i putted well only one bogey on the card i hit some good putts and a couple slipped by
9065295 you just have to try to concentrate on what youre doing and i had a job to do today and thats play 18 holes
9065296 i thought i done a pretty good job i kept it out of my mind as much as i possibly could
9065297 im as relaxed as they come im focusing on every shot one at a time
9065298 i just listen to my head and my heads very positive i think thats the best attitude you can have just listen to your own mind
9065299 im playing against a particular player and i know i can take this guy one on one and basically just beat him on my own

9065306 contra a gente as equipes n o s o mais t o ousadas como antes o palmeiras at jogou de igual para igual mas o cruzeiro veio para o rio de janeiro com uma postura defensiva bem definida isso nos dificulta agora isso que tenho de colocar na cabe a dos jogadores que temos de aprender a jogar contra as retrancas que aparecer o daqui para a frente

9065330 dugway is the only facility known in recent years to have processed anthrax spores into the powdery form that is most easily inhaled
9065331 army officials in washington said yesterday that fort detrick does not have the equipment for making dried anthrax spores
9065332 over the past several years the united states has embarked on a program of secret research on biological weapons even the clinton white house was unaware of their full scope the projects which have not been previously disclosed have been embraced by the bush administration which intends to expand them
9065333 t he need to keep such projects secret was a significant reason behind president bushs recent rejection of a draft agreement to strengthen the germ weapons treaty the 1972 biological weapons convention which has been signed by 143 nations
9065334 in my opinion there are maybe four or five people in the whole country who might be able to make this stuff and im one of them
9065335 and even with a good lab and staff to help run it it might take me a year to come up with a product as good
9065336 a startlingly refined weapons grade anthrax spore preparation the likes of which had never been seen before by personnel at fort detrick
9065337 it is extremely improbable that this type of preparation could ever have been produced at fort detrick certainly not of the grade and quality found in that envelope

9065393 this is where it will live forever instead a senior editor at tor books discovered it liked it and was interested in purchasing it despite the fact that scalzi had given it away for free as it were
9065394 conquering the universe was getting to me the unsettled feeling had begun at gindal where we ambushed gindalian soldiers as they returned to their aeries slashing their huge wings with beams and rockets that sent them tumbling and screeching down sheer two thousand meter cliff faces it had really started to affect me above udaspri as we donned inertia dampening power packs to provide better control as we leaped from rock fragment to rock fragment in udaspris rings playing hide and seek with the spider like vindi who had taken to hurtling bits of the ring down to the planet below plotting delicate decaying orbits that aimed the falling debris directly on top of the human colony of halford by the time we arrived at cova banda i was ready to snap
9065395 on the fifth day during which the afternoon was spent in an informational session about the disposition of the human colonies and their relationship with other intelligent species which was to say bad all the time the 8th critically evaluated pre colonial era speculative fiction and entertainments about interstellar wars with aliens the verdicts were reasonably consistent the war of the worlds met with approval until the ending which struck the 8th as a cheap trick starship troopers had some good action scenes but required too much unpacking of philosophical ideas they liked the movie better even though they recognized it was dumber the forever war made most of the 8th unaccountably sad the idea that a war could go on that long was almost unfathomable to a group of people who were a week old after watching star wars everyone wanted a lightsaber and was irritated that the technology for them didnt really exist
9065396 in the first weekend of zhong guo i presided over roanokes first wedding between katherine chao formerly of franklin and kevin jones formerly of rus there was much rejoicing two weeks later i presided over roanokes first divorce fortunately not of chao and jones beata had finally gotten her fill of antagonizing jann kranjic and let him off the hook there was much rejoicing
9065397 autumnal nothing to do with leaves it is to do with a certain brownness at the edges of the day brown is creeping up on us take my word for it russets and tangerine shades of old gold flushing the very outside edge of the senses deep shining ochres burnt umber and parchments of baked earth reflecting on itself and through itself filtering the light at such times perhaps coincidentally the leaves might fall somewhere
9065398 the lovely warm feeling of satisfaction resulting from enthusiastic reviews
9065399 its 8 million worth of taxpayers money and 14 months too late
9065400 why the afp couldnt have come to this conclusion around the same time as the queensland police service and around the same time as asio we dont know
9065401 were now calling on the government to expand its terms of reference of the clarke inquiry because there are serious questions as to why the afp has continued to call our client a suspect over the course of the last 14 months when asio the queensland police service all concluded that there was not basis for that description
9065402 the explanation needs to say how this could have become such a damaging episode not just for dr haneef but for this nation
9065403 corey brings a great deal of enthusiasm energy leadership and relevant experience to his new position

9065411 many people think that fitness training is just about doing cardio exercise but its important to incorporate strength training and relaxation too
9065412 understanding whats going on inside your body is essential for your overall well being and the tools built into the f55 make it the ultimate fitness tool to help exercisers achieve that
9065413 the cs300 fills a void in the market for cross training users since it can be utilized for a variety of activities
9065414 the cs300 is a cycling based model but the monitor can easily be used for other cardio activities such as running or swimming
9065415 unhappy with the micromanagers at fox recutting his film the dejected filmmaker groaned
9065416 ich nehme den schmerz von dir wir sind vom selben stern
9065417 you have to learn how to keep your body in shape
9065418 kids who are in shape are happier and have a more positive attitude
9065419 the school is good they take a lot of time and effort and put it into health
9065420 everything in our curriculum is geared towards life long skills now
9065421 we want kids to one day exercise on their own
9065422 hopefully this is showing kids you dont have to be on an athletic team to be in shape
9065423 we like to do things in class that keep kids active for life
9065424 we do a lot of things you can do as an adult
9065425 its helping you get into the habit of working out outside of sports
9065426 there are school districts that have cut back on physical education but we havent
9065427 in all of our phy ed classes they promote the fitness center but they also promote staying healthy and doing your own thing
9065428 the school has taught me how to stay healthy and fit
9065429 people who go to college and still want to stay active can even if they arent going to be on a sports team
9065430 nobody cares if you can run a 40 yard dash when you are 40
9065431 athletic ability has nothing to do with life long fitness
9065432 concepts regarding health and wellness are spread into various parts of our curriculum
9065433 we talk about nutrition and understanding the food groups and understanding how to put together a well rounded diet and reading labels
9065434 the national recognition award is given each year to an organization that has done exceptional work in supporting physical activity physical education or sport as it relates to naspes mission and has supported naspe as an organization
9065435 were extremely honored to be recognized by naspe for this award
9065436 as a company we are committed to helping people improve their health and well being were particularly proud of the part that our technology has played in equipping teachers with the knowledge and tools to help kids establish a lifetime of fitness
9065437 the new sites prevent many craven county voters from having to drive as far as 50 miles round trip to vote the added hours keep all one stop location hours consistent and early voting less confusing to the public
9065438 it would limit how many voters could be accommodated at the sites
9065439 have to be dedicated to the specific site for the election and has to remain dedicated until the results are downloaded election day
9065440 when things used to go wrong the food was there
9065441 i would turn to it and it would make me feel better i have been trapped in a destructive cycle of binge and over eating all my life
9065442 it would be secretive i would eat in private all binge eaters do
9065443 it doesnt matter where you are as long as there is space to put the food in front of you and then just get the food down thats the most important thing
9065444 for breakfast i might have last nights take away i might have some cereal
9065445 then i will go and buy a big bar of chocolate before lunchtime
9065446 at lunchtime i might have a plate of food another takeaway or a sandwich
9065447 then id go and buy some more chocolate and then id have my evening meal
9065448 and then before i went to bed i would eat some more
9065449 it is fair to say that overeaters arent getting the support or attention that people with anorexia and bulimia receive
9065450 it is not seen as a eating disorder but it is and this is the battle that we are facing
9065451 the problem is that we just simply dont know how many people are suffering from bed binge eating disorder and compulsive overeating
9065452 last year beat received 88 000 calls from people who are suffering from eating disorders but we are concerned about people who arent contacting us
9065453 we know that people who are suffering from anorexia or bulimia are more likely to ask for help rather than people who overeaters
9065454 when we see someone is thin or has lost weight we tend to congratulate them saying you look good
9065455 however when we see someone who is overweight we think you are greedy you are lazy you have eaten too much
9065456 it wouldnt occur to many people that people who are overweight have disorders too they are compulsively overeating for many reasons psychological emotional many many reasons
9065457 they may use food as comfort to manage undesirable feelings
9065458 whatever feelings they are experiencing neglect sadness unhappiness food may soften and soothe that for a short while
9065459 the problem is that after the food is eaten those feelings are replaced with anger frustration as they tend to criticise and beat themselves up following an episode of overeating and that is how this destructive cycle happens
9065460 it wasnt explained to me at that point that i had a proper disorder
9065461 now things are different im a lot more accepting of who i am and im trying to get my eating under control and be a happier person
9065462 my advice would be to others in my situation to research all the options out there
9065463 i had success with the halliwick unit st anns hospital tottenham a specialist psychological therapy service
9065464 our aim is for every single school to welcome children from all backgrounds it is a simple goal strongly supported by the public educationalists and students
9065465 there are those who attend church in order that their children qualify for admission to a particular school and never set foot in the church again after the children have been accepted
9065466 all children regardless of their religion culture and family income should have equal access to the best possible education in a good local school
9065467 allowing schools to pick and choose pupils is not the best way to achieve this or to create young adults with the confidence and personal skills to live and work in our vibrant multi cultural society
9065468 parents should be able to choose the type of education and ethos they want for their children the bottom line is that faith schools are successful thriving popular and here to stay
9065469 it is down to locally accountable councils and communities themselves not some campaign group to decide what sort of schools they should have
9065470 an area where the eu could already throw its full weight as a significant arctic actor
9065471 the precautionary principle the principles of preventive action that environmental damage should be by priority rectified at the source and that the polluter should pay
9065472 going through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better
9065473 in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9065474 we are disappointed by cus decision as we believe the series ultimately belongs in denver
9065475 however in light of cus decision to play the 2009 game in boulder we believe we owe it to colorado state university our alumni fans students and the city of fort collins to bring the 2010 game back to hughes stadium
9065476 this storm has the potential for being a very dangerous storm
9065477 i do not want to speculate but i am fearful that we could be looking at a number in the region of 10 in terms of the number of people who have died
9065478 the water is rising fast and there is widespread looting down here
9065479 the people are even stripping the material from one of the bridges it is awful
9065480 this is a tool that must be on the table to buy us time until our long term energy plans can be put into place we have already enjoyed the support of alaska senator ted stevens and it is gratifying to see senator obama get on board
9065481 shes either grossly misinformed or intentionally misleading and both are unbecoming
9065482 even the bush administration cant deny the reality of global warming
9065483 the governor is aligning herself and the state of alaska with the most discredited fringe extreme viewpoints by denying this
9065484 the planet is a very clever thing it can repair itself provided you dont go too far
9065485 the uae gets some of the highest amounts of light from the sun compared to anywhere in the world
9065486 we need to concentrate efforts to slash carbon emissions and become more energy efficient in order to prevent dangerous climate change
9065487 the strategy i am launching today outlines in detail the range of weather conditions facing london which could both seriously threaten our quality of life particularly that of the most vulnerable people and endanger our pre eminence as one of the worlds leading cities
9065488 london is not unique all major cities such as new york and tokyo are at risk from climate change by producing this strategy we put london in a position of strength
9065489 shes not totally convinced one way or the other science will tell us she thinks the jurys still out
9065490 one of the most anti environment records of any governor in the united states
9065491 she has supported oil drilling in some of the most ecologically sensitive areas in alaska even when it meant sacrificing polar bears beluga whales and the arctic national wildlife refuge
9065492 despite her advocacy for expanded oil and gas drilling palin has done almost nothing to promote the clean energy sources that can help solve global warming which is already having major negative consequences in her state
9065493 a changing environment will affect alaska more than any other state because of our location
9065494 im not one though who would attribute it to being man made
9065495 we want to have a product with total traceability from cane seeding to the final product we believe theres a market for this kind of product especially in europe
9065496 many people say sugar and ethanol are only for large scale producers and were showing this is not true these are small suppliers who are organized and looking ahead
9065497 if a tree falls in the woods and nobody is there to hear it does it make a sound
9065498 johnsons presidency represented the zenith of american liberalism and its downfall
9065499 the lion roared one last time and we were all his cubs
9065500 are particularly useful in a sentence that is long and complex
9065501 this resulted in lack of clarity on what was happening who was doing what where with whom with what whose support and what was being achieved
9065502 this led to duplication of efforts inefficiencies and ineffectiveness in programming the lack of a co coordinated approach to programming also made it difficult to identify gaps and priorities in the sector to assess the strategic value of the different efforts and to ensure that the different programmes performed to expected standards
9065503 profile womens priority needs identifying key actors and institutions to address them and provide a roadmap for strategic and comprehensive support
9065504 a common financing mechanism to address essential needs and sustain gender equality support within development planning
9065505 while unifem has had previous fund management experience as a un arm the same cannot be said of the womens coalition of zimbabwe wcoz
9065506 this new role means setting up systems transformation of the womens coalition from just a coordinator of the womens organisation to playing a pivotal role this also means that key personnel has to be has to be hired that which has fund management experience
9065507 although aug 1 was set as the beginning of the implementation date the whole programme and inception phase envisaged late 2007 and beginning of 2008 had not anticipated a rather unpredictable and stretched election period
9065508 in addition the resulting political violence and victimisation saw womens organisations having to take up the role of offering humanitarian support to hundreds of women victims as opposed to continuing the inception phase which had become impossible under the then prevailing conditions
9065509 impact negatively on our activities as she pursued these issues with a passion
9065510 we have yet to identify the grant recipients because we are still in the process of developing the project document and the systems tools and procedures for basket fund management
9065511 what we can say though is that the fund will specifically target multiple sectors as per the identified thematic areas it will seek to support a broad range of issues in the thematic areas as well as involvement of a broad range of players among civil society organizations as this is a national programme it is expected that there will be wide geographical coverage of the basket fund
9065512 this is a good initiative it gives organisations with shared objectives to work together identify problems together thus using minimum funds on a wide range of projects but i do not know why we still havent been contacted our organisation has the widest representation of rural women
9065513 marginalised groups specifically rural women and women living with disability
9065514 special attempts will be made to involve the smaller erstwhile neglected marginalised organisations groups working in remote and underprivileged communities to ensure that they receive some grants examples of such groups are hiv positive women women informal sector workers migrant women indigenous communities women survivors of gender based violence and women with disabilities
9065515 in this respect the inception phase that is project design strategy and tools for implementation continues to take place but is expected to be concluded in the next two or three months with implementation phase set to begin thereafter
9065516 consistent with the recommendation of the gender scoping study that preceded the development of the national gender equality and womens empowerment programme the basket fund will also reach out to mens organisations for example padare enkundleni mens forum on gender to promote a systematic and structured approach to mens involvement and contribution to gender equality and womens empowerment
9065517 she called me and i saw the time it was 3 a m in tel aviv

9065519 we are pleased to notify you that many fine pianos used in our department of music are now available for purchase these include grand pianos baby grands studios consoles and digital pianos
9065520 its going to be a significant amount of time that hes going to miss
9065521 but as you know he hasnt been put down in any way shape or form so were counting on him to come back
9065522 shes a fairly articulate spokesperson for the pro drilling view that will provide an interesting contrast to the opposition
9065523 if a domestic solution isnt a part of a national energy plan then our nation is in a world of hurt
9065524 were going to continue to be reliant on foreign dangerous regimes to feed our hungry markets
9065525 shes taken the ethical high ground and distanced herself from veco
9065526 she also has attempted to reverse the course established by the murkowski administration which was one where the administration directly negotiated with the oil industry in secret
9065527 gov palin certainly showed leadership on the gas line if sen mccain happens to be elected as president that would put a strong representative in the administration in washington thats in favor of an alaska gas line

9065574 im prinzip oder auf dem papier sind alle f r territoriale integrit t und gegen separatismus die russische f deration vertritt diese prinzipien ebenfalls wegen ihrer eigenen problematischen regionen wie tschetschenien aber wenn es seinen eigenen interessen entspricht verteidigt moskau die selben kriterien auch vorsichtig f r andere wie in der kosovofrage oder f r zypern moskau unterst tzt die griechisch zypriotische verwaltung seit langem in der zypernfrage protestierte gegen die einrichtung eines eigenen staates durch die t rken und erkannte die t rkische republik nordzypern trnc nicht an das russische vorgehen in s dossetien und die aktive unterst tzung des dortigen separatismus und demjenigen in abchasien zeigen dass russland die gegenseite einnimmt wenn seine eigenen interessen betroffen sind die anerkennung der separatistischen regionen durch moskau im konflikt mit der territorialen integrit t georgiens ist ein schlechtes beispiel f r die griechischen zyprioten die immer russische sympathie und unterst tzung genossen
9065575 es ist wahr dass russland uns im zypernproblem unterst tzt hat es ist kein zufall dass die republik zypern moskau als einen stabilen verb ndeten betrachtet weil seine moskaus thesen gegen ber dem zypernproblem auf dem v lkerrecht basieren die berufung auf das v lkerrecht ist die st rkste waffe die wir haben deswegen m ssen wir sehr vorsichtig sein wie wir die krise zwischen russland und georgien interpretieren die republik zypern wird bald offiziell stellung zu diesem thema nehmen m ssen diese stellungnahme muss sich nicht von derjenigen unterscheiden die wir seit jahren haben das hei t dass wir vorbehaltlos f r den respekt und den schutz der territorialen souver nit t der staaten einstehen die haltung die wir f r den kosovo eingenommen haben muss auch im falle georgiens gelten sonst legen wir minen auf unseren eigenen weg
9065576 die t rkei sitzt in der kaukasuskrise zwischen zwei st hlen w hrend die usa und viele europ ische staaten die anerkennung der unabh ngigkeit abchasiens und s dossetiens durch russland verurteilt haben beschr nkte sich ankara auf eine erkl rung des au enministeriums in der die besorgnis der t rkei ber die j ngsten entwicklungen zum ausdruck gebracht wurde das war eher ein minimum als ein maximum an diplomatischer kritik wenn die t rkei moskau wegen dessen anerkennung der unabh ngigkeit s dossetiens und abchasiens zu heftig verurteilt riskiert ankara dass es aus moskau zu h ren bekommt die t rkei habe ja in zypern das gleiche getan die t rkei k nnte sogar versucht sein das russische beispiel als vorbild f r zypern zu nehmen das spiel mit den beiden entgegengesetzten prinzipien dem nationalen selbstbestimmungsrecht auch von minderheiten in kosovo und auf zypern und der territorialen integrit t in allen anderen f llen ist beraus heikel
9065577 die einzige sanktion die russland schmerzhaft tr fe w re wenn europa dem land kein gas mehr abn hme das aber kann die eu nicht einmal theoretisch tun weil sie schneller zusammenbr che als russland es bemerken w rde die abh ngigkeit von russischen rohstoffen ist eine tods nde nie war es in der eu m glich sich auf eine gemeinsame energiepolitik zu einigen man k nnte russland freilich auch aus der g8 staatengruppe ausschlie en da geh rt das land ohnehin nicht hin seine aufnahme war seinerzeit nur eine geste an michail gorbatschow ein boykott der olympischen spiele von sotschi w re nur eine moralische geste also was dann eine einfuhrverbot f r russischen kaviar quatsch dem westen bleibt nichts als rational zu handeln und zu retten was noch zu retten ist beide georgischen provinzen sind verloren vor allem geht es jetzt darum die ukraine vor einem hnlichen schicksal zu bewahren

9065594 in hope springs for instance i play the leader of a group of women who go up to the age of 70 theyre a bunch of ultra capable women its fab i keep thinking when would you ever see a drama like this in the states british audiences love actresses because of who they are rather than how old they are in the us there is always another starlet coming along whos the new discovery
9065595 they dont cherish their actresses through the ages there lots of women who were hot when they were young are used less and less as the years pass the perception is that they have lost their looks but i think peoples faces become more interesting as they grow older
9065596 the thing i miss most when im in the us is kippers
9065597 so the very first thing i did after i landed in the uk was buy kippers did they live up to expectations oh my goodness yes
9065598 id be happy to move back here but the dilemma is my husband works in the us and my daughter is at school there
9065599 being apart from them is pretty terrible we never leave it longer than six weeks thats my absolute limit without seeing them but salome emails me every day and we can talk on skype thank god for modern technology
9065600 when youre training to be an actress in england what do you expect maybe a bit of theatre starring in a hugely successful american series just does not enter your consciousness so i was completely taken aback to get the role of elizabeth working on the series was an extraordinary journey and i absolutely loved it
9065601 i kept thinking were going to get slated by her fans the jane austen society are going to hate this but when i saw the finished product i was pleasantly surprised i dont think the fans will complain because its done with such love its about someone who totally adores jane austen
9065602 i hope viewers will be charmed by this certainly when i read the script i thought this is a situation that so many people will have dreamt of after all which woman hasnt wondered if only i could meet mr darcy would he be drawn to me i know i have
9065603 were going to go in there and do our best
9065604 religion never has to deliver it only has to promise to deliver
9065605 know a thousand things but do not know a single human being
9065606 i was so tired of being asked is this you is this you
9065607 that i chose to write clara shes a 19th century dead german no ones going to think thats me and yes
9065608 ghastly exploitative its a kind of prostitution where youre parading misery and happenstance answers
9065609 i mean love is wonderful but barbara cartlands are stupid
9065610 its when you finish it and you sit back and read it as the first reader that it can sometimes sock you right between the eyes
9065611 just to get them there the only way i could write it was to make everyone a character its almost like how a director stages an opera
9065612 my sister had a lot of problems shall we say but one of them was that she didnt like women
9065613 thats where my incipient feminism came from there was no empathy for women in our house my granny hated my mother my mother and nora had a constant battle i was constantly belittled for being female and told that horrible things would happen to me because i was a girl
9065614 the only game im prepared to engage in very far is flirting theres a funny thing sexually between us right now for example im covered in make up and youre not youre sitting there pretending you cant see that my eyelids are a funny colour its how men and women behave there are always games and where there are games theres a whole richness of stones to look under
9065615 find myself a choir im going to be a member of the chorus which is where i really belong
9065616 saved me you have to find something beyond relationships to make life worth living you need people who love you and whom you can trust and you need the thing that will save you when theyre not available
9065617 we have chosen to stay in a room all by ourselves chatting to ourselves and if were not barking mad were boring or megalomaniacs
9065618 because everyone expects them to be funny off stage as well
9065619 ive had a reaction from some people whove read it who said that they would never have thought that was me in any way
9065620 eat drink and make love for other things are not worth this
9065621 had dinner with the editor of a national broadsheet the editor of a sunday broadsheet and the former editor of a tabloid
9065622 hes said one double said another squared said the last
9065623 ten days before the end of the year i found myself at the birthday parties of two national newspaper editors at both events cameron was discussed at length and on each occasion he was honoured with a new soubriquet britains next prime minister
9065624 i know ive asked you this before but do you ever feel like giving up
9065625 did you ever have a dark moment when you considered jumping over to the other side i mean here was a fabulously sexy modernising labour party
9065626 i am not a cameron apologist and nor am i even a real tory
9065627 a new kind of tory the sort of tory no one had ever seen before
9065628 i dont just back marriage but i also back civil partnerships
9065629 look this is not just some view that springs from religion or morality its just common sense that kids have a better chance when mum and dad are both there to bring them up
9065630 yes but dont you think religion and morality are useful perhaps even more useful than your piffling tax breaks if they encourage people to stay married
9065631 ridiculous to expect someone to have an opinion on absolutely everything
9065632 there is no more important art form than sculpture it is the be all and end all of art and im going to prove it
9065633 if your contributors object was merely to insult parrys memory which according to him is already non existent why write about him at all
9065634 it is difficult of course to say at present how much original thought there is one does not expect it or indeed wish for it at his absorbent age but i did see a feeling for beauty and a sense of style
9065635 if deer had guns i wouldve been back out there

9065637 structuring the council his drugs syndicate the way i did it was the democratic aspect of it all i never shouldve treated those guys fairly i should have treated them like dogs
9065638 because of the fractures in so many african american families
9065639 the council could not bind together as a family im talking about positive values unity staying together i dont know what kind of oedipal bull was going on with these dudes in terms of me
9065640 cooled the dude out quick with a few hundreds so he slid us right on in

9065658 ive heard about slow food and knew it was from italy but this is amazing the garden is beautiful and it should always be here

9065664 at least some of that land could be turned into productive use food is an important issue and we need to support supporting local agriculture in a big way

9065694 as far back as i can remember ive been a news junkie
9065695 were a party that desperately needs women and desperately needs young people
9065696 but the bottom line is she doesnt have a whole lot of experience she just doesnt
9065697 i wonder if her youth will accentuate mccains age over time in a bad way

9065700 after his attacks on obamas readiness for the job itll be amusing to hear a 72 year old with a history of health problems justify this decision
9065701 shes a talent but thats the end of the experience

9065703 shes just never been in this kind of environment before

9065709 for a generation certain evangelical teachers have told us that the gifts of the spirit ceased at the death of the apostles or at the completion of the new testament this of course is a doctrine without a syllable of biblical authority back of it the result of this erroneous teaching is that spiritually gifted persons are ominously few among us this frightening hour calls aloud for men with the gift of prophetic insight instead we have men who conduct surveys polls and panel discussions we need men with the gift of knowledge in their place we have men with scholarship nothing more thus we may be preparing ourselves for the tragic hour when god may set us aside as so called evangelicals and raise up another movement to keep new testament christianity alive in the earth the truth of the matter is that the scriptures plainly imply the imperative of possessing the gifts of the spirit but i must also add a word of caution the various spiritual gifts are not equally valuable as paul so carefully explains certain brethren have magnified one gift out of seventeen out of all proportion among these brethren there have been and are many godly souls but the general moral results of this teaching have nevertheless not been good in practice it has resulted in much shameless exhibitionism a tendency to depend upon experiences instead of upon christ and often a lack of ability to distinguish the works of the flesh from the operations of the spirit those who deny that the gifts are for us today and those who insist upon making a hobby of one gift are both wrong and we are all suffering the consequences of their error

9065717 zito says he is going to do whatever it takes to make a sale
9065718 wells fargo bank is foreclosing on the couples house because they have made no payments on the mortgage since it adjusted to the higher rate of 15 9 percent in march 2007
9065719 nickisch so after a few months they lowered the price
9065720 nilson yeah but it wasnt that the value came down the value was never there it was never worth 636 000
9065721 nickisch but the owners felt it was worth a shot

9065723 a few years ago people were buying properties at foreclosures and flipping them after fixing them up hillstead said but not now
9065724 prospective buyers need to make sure there arent second or third mortgages on the property and they need to find out what condition the home is in hillstead warned there was a foreclosed property hillstead recalled where the people moved out and turned off the heat but left the water running
9065725 a neighbor saw water coming out of a second floor bathroom window hillstead said
9065726 they just walked away from the deposits rather than close on them because of the market slowdown collins said
9065727 most people arent in as bad a shape as they think he said
9065728 foreclosures are hurting not only the families being forced out but the homeowners left behind
9065729 for midlanders realtors said the increased inventory has caused some frustration for sellers who are used to seeing homes sell within hours of hitting the market and cant understand why they may have to cut their price a little to find a buyer
9065730 weve seen more price reductions than weve seen in probably the last six months said chris beckett at pine amp beckett realtors however beckett said while thats hard for homeowners to reconcile with it doesnt mean the offers theyre getting arent consistent with the increase in home prices from last year
9065731 the picture harry oestreich snoqualmies finance director drew was not pretty
9065732 theres a lot of land that was sold in bend for very high prices brennan said
9065733 jill armstrong and her husband bought two acres of land in redmond and got city and zoning approval creating 16 town home lots we got it through on time and under budget thought we were doing great until there were no buyers armstrong said
9065734 with so many properties on the market the armstrongs didnt sell and the bank took it back
9065735 we hardly did any of these loans and the ones that we did were mostly reserved for foreign investors or more sophisticated borrowers said zoebel dela cruz principal broker of team mortgage hawaii
9065736 many hawaii real estate agents and brokers who were self employed used these loans to finance their own purchases dela cruz said now that business has turned some real estate agents and mortgage brokers are having a harder time making their payments dela cruz said
9065737 greedy homeowners and buyers sought out new loans because they figured the astronomical real estate price increases of the boom years early in this decade would continue forever
9065738 for many in the past year house payments became the easiest thing to scrap especially when many middle class families found declining real estate prices evaporated all their equity with home loan balances emerging as higher than home values at the same time these families often see comparable homes available for rent at prices far lower than their newly bumped up loan payments
9065739 the result has been a mass tendency to say to heck with our credit rating lets get out of here
9065740 the master bathroom was cleared out toilet sink and shower stall gone the only thing left was the drain in the corner she said
9065741 the vice president is a heartbeat away from becoming president so to choose someone with not one hours worth of experience on national issues is a dangerous choice
9065742 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken the only similarity between her and hillary clinton is that they are both women on the issues they could not be further apart
9065743 sen mccain had so many other options if he wanted to put a woman on his ticket such as sen kay bailey hutchison or sen olympia snowe they would have been an appropriate choice compared to this dangerous choice
9065744 itll make them want to leave the military once their tour of duty was done

9065755 are a concern as they may foreshadow a slowdown in market demand
9065756 even my mother reverted to how she was when we were children taking my brothers side which was ironic given that i was arguing that she should be able to choose her own type of care while my brother thought he knew better
9065757 when your elderly parent becomes dependent on you it very often leads to rifts between siblings even when there has been no conflict for decades
9065758 it injects some very strong emotions such as tension and worry into the family dynamic which are usually coupled with passionate views one daughter might be strongly in favour for instance of homeopathic medicine and father making his own decision about whether he should go into a home her sister might have more traditional views about medicine and insist that father should go into a home immediately then another sibling might have an eye on inheritance and would be happy to do whatever is required to save money
9065759 we dont always see eye to eye about things and have always had very different views
9065760 but it hasnt been like this before not since we were children
9065761 brothers and sisters even in late middle age can find themselves often subconsciously competing for their parents attention and preference
9065762 in fact it can be brought to the fore when the parent is elderly its like its their last chance
9065763 you might become more complex in the way you deal with emotions but your core feelings tend to stay the same a parent getting older can remind us of that quite forcefully
9065764 after mum died my dad became very depressed and later attempted suicide but my sister just took the attitude that he needed to pull himself together she would snap at him which would break my heart although to an extent i could understand it because he was being hard work but i think what was really happening was that she was angry with him and my mum because i was treated differently as the youngest
9065765 my sister has all this anger about the way she was treated as a child by mum that she seems to feel able to take out on her now that dad has gone that worries me because i think shell feel guilty when mums gone but when i try to point that out she just thinks im taking mums side
9065766 im starting to think what was mum really like is my perception of her correct was my childhood as good as i seem to remember thats particularly difficult to deal with when im trying to care for her
9065767 so far the four of us have managed to avoid arguing but it has caused a strain between us at times the other day one of them suggested she get a certain kind of car and did all the research but mum went behind her back to tell another sibling she wanted a different kind of car i think my dad absorbed a lot of this kind of stuff and sort of managed mum but hes no longer here
9065768 my mother would write to me saying things like myras trying to put me in a home you must stop her my mother was trying to get me on side but i didnt want to be on anybodys side it took me right back
9065769 myra even blamed me for my mothers death when she learned id received a letter from mum posted that day she concluded that if she hadnt gone out into the summer heat to the post box she wouldnt have collapsed
9065770 each of us sees our parents in a different light often dramatically so and thats essential to acknowledge and respect
9065771 ive come across so many people whove had tremendous arguments with their siblings about what their mother would want why not find out what she actually wants while she can still think clearly i also think its important to decide on power of attorney early on
9065772 our research shows that in 72 of cases it is a daughter who does the physical practical everyday caring regardless of whether she has brothers
9065773 my mother came to live with us in 2001 when she became very dependent and even though my brother lived just 25 miles away he used to come and see her about three times a year
9065774 my relationship with him was never that strong but it really started to deteriorate id only call him if say our mother was unwell for ages he didnt even accept she was anything other than perfectly capable
9065775 hell phone my parents who are both in their 80s and say how are you and my mum will invariably say were fine darling and hell put the phone down satisfied that theyre ok when i call ill say what does ok mean how is daddy really do you have plans today what are you eating tonight i need to know that mum has something to look forward to in the next couple of days and that shes getting enough rest
9065776 its not that my brother doesnt care but he doesnt really accept that theyre unwell and ive always been the carer in the family
9065777 i moved to live with my mother in london and only one of my brothers really helps me and he lives further away than most of the rest of them
9065778 but i think the real reason our relationship is getting worse is because they are embarrassed about how little they do and i think theres jealousy about my relationship with mum too
9065779 the biggest areas of denial are depression and mental illness a lot of people cant acknowledge its happened to their parent who theyve always seen as in control that can be frustrating for another sibling who does accept it and needs their support
9065780 the problem with this is that the others often wind up feeling guilty and jealous and that mix of emotions can in itself lead to difficulties
9065781 some people think they might miss out and get suspicious of the sibling whos taking on the responsibility of caring that is very common im always surprised by how mercenary people can be about inheritance
9065782 my mother moved in with us and gave the carpet to my wife as a thank you for taking care of her but my two sisters were so irked by not getting what they felt should be theirs that they stopped all contact with us even now i dont even know if theyre alive
9065783 but like so many of these things it wasnt really about the carpet its about what it stood for my sisters realised she was saying my wife was more of a daughter than they ever were
9065784 my five siblings and i are currently caring for my dad who has dementia and my mum who is very frail and were stronger than ever
9065785 admittedly the sibling who lives closest to our parents does most of the practical things but weve worked it out as best we can in terms of time one brother lives in switzerland but hes still part of the rota one of the biggest resentments between siblings is about one living further away from another but theres still a lot you can do from a distance
9065786 all through my life my younger sister was the articulate capable one and so when our mother got alzheimers i thought shed be the one holding it all together but it quickly became clear that the roles were reversing that this was an area i excelled in that affected my self esteem while my sister felt grateful i could take over i think my sister saw our mother as mum and couldnt cope with what was happening whereas i was able to see mum as a woman in her own right its taught us something about each other and were closer for it
9065787 people see her as the symbol of purity in an atmosphere of corruption
9065788 todd and i are so proud of him and of all the fine men and women serving this country
9065789 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9065790 im gonna f shoot your dad hes gonna get a lead bullet
9065791 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
9065792 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
9065793 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
9065794 were not at all convinced the democrats are succeeding at depicting mccain as a bush clone but the republican convention provides an opportunity to see to it that they do not
9065795 one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
9065796 now i dont believe that sen mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
9065797 i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year john mccain doesnt get it
9065798 the most remarkable thing about al gores speech last night was how unremarkable it was
9065799 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of humankind

9065804 the courts interpretation of the constitution calls the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the constitution
9065805 credit growth is actually slowing so the rba has actually achieved what it wanted to do by raising rates and slowing domestic demand and slowing the rate of domestic credit
9065806 now is the time to get out on the front foot
9065807 you shouldnt be waiting until its really obvious that inflation has gone all the way back down to where wed like it to be before you can conclude youve got to start doing something before that day
9065808 we think they will cut rates to mitigate the downside risks from that
9065809 we dont think they may be as aggressive as past easing cycles
9065810 by the middle of next year it will be clear that inflation is heading down and the reserve bank will have cut interest rates by over 100 basis points
9065811 certainly the board hasnt given me that indication and neither have the shareholders
9065812 i will be guided by what they want right now i still think im the best person to get us through this point in time and get us to the other side
9065813 i know this business very well ive been doing it for 20 years and im very focused on the australian and new zealand businesses
9065814 we had new auditors this year and consequently again its just making sure we tick every box now especially with this increased scrutiny
9065815 the parents are still paying fees and the government still pays a fair portion so its a good operation
9065816 we remind the company that having set an example with mike carlton it may need to sack all the undersigned if it insists on this course of action
9065817 we believe the company hires columnists on the basis that they have principles it is wrong to sack them for the same reason
9065818 mike is not a member of the sydney morning herald staff
9065819 its not a half decent product its a very decent product its as normal
9065820 well reserve our rights on all of that and well make decisions as things evolve
9065821 not the hard news not the international news not the business sport local news that is not the part of the business that is being affected at all
9065822 its really quite mischievous of people to say that theres going to be a decline in the quality
9065823 each party negotiating this has their own views about their own standards being better
9065824 but as long as we can show were not lowering safety and were lowering cost were all interested in that

9065826 children use the internet and their mobile phones to send harmful messages which marginalise children and can have devastating consequences
9065827 as with bullying cyber bullying can lead to social isolations for those effected by it to a point where they can feel at the edge of their social network and at the very worse of cases at the edge of life
9065828 there is no justification for any violence against a child under an circumstances or at any time
9065829 all of our principals sign an agreement with us saying if their school gets a d or an f two years in a row or three cs in a row we can remove them

9065832 we had high schools that had a 30 per cent graduation rate i shut those schools down and replaced them with smaller high schools in the same building and some of those schools now have a 70 or 80 per cent graduation rate

9065849 we have roughly 10 of our volunteers in gaza and we have to get them
9065850 we need to get the passengers together hopefully within a month
9065851 this might be the beginning of a simple delivery service if we can set up the mechanisms here in cyprus this can be used as a model for what can be made more permanent
9065852 i hope to get an artificial leg so i can have a chance at walking again
9065853 i dont have a real life in gaza its full of death and chaos
9065854 the concept of sexual addiction is a controversial one and thats because it is difficult to define
9065855 there are a lot of people who are critical of the concept because we live in a society that tends to over medicalize and which makes every behavior which deviates from the norm an addiction or a disorder
9065856 im very happy today to spend my birthday with you and to make a historic announcement in dayton
9065857 a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built
9065858 it turns out that the women in america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling
9065859 i thought it was unfair to us and to him
9065860 its a very reasoned response from those jurors because they apparently recognized this was not something they were well suited to determine
9065861 in my view its going to cause the u s attorneys to give a second thought to prosecuting soldiers for acts that occurred in combat
9065862 how many jurors have been involved in a domestic dispute in which a person was killed none you dont put those people on a jury
9065863 i dont think any of us who passed that legislation thought we were now going to have people discharged from the military being charged in federal court
9065864 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
9065865 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
9065866 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
9065867 we dont foresee any sanctions decided on by the european council
9065868 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia
9065869 after the storm moves away from jamaica significant intensification is possible
9065870 it is simply impossible to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
9065871 the chances of hurricane force winds within the next five days are essentially the same at each individual location from the florida panhandle coast westward through the entire coastline of louisiana
9065872 i think were going to get more than what most people expect
9065873 its not worth our lives to sit out a hurricane

9065877 i knew if i missed the cut it was pretty much over
9065878 it was the biggest round of golf in my career
9065879 the right is nothing if not filled with liars and hypocrites
9065880 it gave that old sense of the way people used to listen to the words of the speech together
9065881 this is the best we could get so were not going to complain
9065882 there was a good distribution of spaces where the need is greatest in the south
9065883 there isnt any new construction this year but there will be 7 a day places in the existing private day cares an increase in the cpes capacity and the creation of places in the private sector
9065884 the places are already in the private sector but it remains unknown if they are already taken
9065885 we expected that eight or 10 projects would be accepted but with the announcement doubling the number of places from now to 2010 we were very pleased to have seen the number of our accepted projects double
9065886 there is the cpe du pic located in the central industrial park that submitted a project in the high tech park
9065887 of those submitted maybe there are projects that are not yet known we will see what the future brings
9065888 the reality is that we must educate the public because many parents register their children for five days a week although their real need is only two to three days
9065889 this is history i dont care if youre republican or a democrat
9065890 i think theres a glimmer of hope that hell see the light tonight
9065891 there is a success that comes from the parental leave and now we must deal with this
9065892 the m tro and construction of the autoroute 25 bridge and highway is bringing and will bring many new families
9065893 our primary objective is to favour the balance between work and family
9065894 the success of the parental insurance plan seems to be maintaining itself but there is also a need to respect the public funding that has already been advanced by four years to meet our commitment for day care places
9065895 its a milieu that functions with ease for five and six years and will respond to the change in the population in the next few years
9065896 its given them a summer to remember and we are all extremely proud of them
9065897 the majority of the team members have been together since 2004 they sealed the deal tonight working hard and earning themselves an entire season undefeated
9065898 last year their season ended in a division tie we felt they could do better so four new players were scouted from lower divisions and bumped up those four fit in perfectly and the team really gelled i dont think they would have been so successful if the team had stayed the same we wouldnt be in this position
9065899 our reserve goalie steven daversa actually a u 9 division 1 player helped make the difference too
9065900 im in the clothing business so finding ways to get souvenirs like the mini t shirt banners i got them this year is easy for me but mostly i do it for the fun even being team manager is a joy
9065901 oh well it is nice to be told what to do by one so young and one so inexperienced
9065902 can you believe he said that the only reason that we said a hot line to faldo is because he is the only one saying it
9065903 no one is he did say he has spoken to nick has anyone else said that no right then it is nick faldos decision
9065904 not necessarily i dont think that necessarily proves that you are on form or not a good solid performance does
9065905 nowadays in europe if you finish from 10th up you are performing quite well because it is tough to win and you have to be fortunate at the right times never in any of my 41 victories have i stood up and said i was unlucky ever
9065906 not at all nick will have made the right decision
9065907 i certainly could have placed higher if i had made this dive it has given me problems all year i am content with my seventh place finish even though i could have finished fifth or sixth
9065908 it was a marvelous olympic experience i tried to appreciate each instant of the finals i have never cried as much with joy these games went by very fast too fast
9065909 it was a difficult evening for me i was very emotional and a bit stressed the pressure of the olympics hit me
9065910 my last dive saved me just like in the olympic trials i keep my best for last
9065911 i was calm for the semi final i had nothing to lose i was consistent during the training and knew i would rebound
9065912 some of them will actually say yes we plan an action and yes we want to be taken into custody
9065913 their intent is not to harm people but to incite civil disturbances and property destruction at the venues and other locations associated with the conventions
9065914 the protesters have actually told us that theyre going to damage property so when they line up and head for downtown were thinking thats probably what theyre going to do
9065915 we only made 91 arrests at the scene but there were maybe six times as many people there
9065916 so the people we arrested were on the street wouldnt get out of the street they locked their arms we told them again to leave they obviously wanted to be arrested
9065917 whats the penalty for blocking a sidewalk or parading without a permit why initiate a confrontation when its only a misdemeanor or a fine
9065918 most people come in with a legitimate reason to protest and arent looking for competition with the police and we need to strike a balance between their first amendment rights and security
9065919 the performance measure isnt how many people are or arent arrested more than that its whether they were able to respond to every situation that occurred if they responded quickly and appropriately thats what theyll measure themselves by
9065920 it sort of felt and looked like new york did right after 9 11
9065921 its a bit overwhelming but if it keeps everything safe then i guess its worth it
9065922 yeah i know im passive aggressive im okay with it
9065923 we embrace all of our legends but its all the sweeter when one of our home players takes home the prize
9065924 this was a hard won victory and viewers will be on the edge of their seats with this episode
9065925 curb the excessive roaming charges consumers had to pay for roaming calls
9065926 the eu roaming regulation was introduced so that europeans could exercise freedom of speech with their mobile phones without fear of excessive bills when traveling in the single market
9065927 as a result over 400 million consumers across europe have benefited from significant savings of around 60 percent when making and receiving calls during travel holiday or business
9065928 in the first quarter of 2008 a customer using data services paid on average 2 05 euros per megabyte while roaming with companies from their operators group and 5 40 euros per megabyte for roaming with non group companies
9065929 italian and slovak consumers who roam with a non group company can even pay over 12 euros per megabyte
9065930 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
9065931 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means

9065938 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
9065939 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country

9065971 we are issuing horowhenua district council with an abatement notice to cease the unauthorised discharge of contaminants onto land where it may enter water
9065972 weve been looking at this pretty closely because weve had some major concerns we waited for the results to wait and see what is actually happening
9065973 its been controlled so will only be a problem if it seeps into the actual water supply but doesnt look like it had done
9065974 theres a working dairy farm between the ponds and the lake
9065975 what we then did was in front of that paddock we dug a drain and put a pump at the end of it to capture anything that was coming through and pump it back into the paddock

9065980 that infamous day five years ago led to a highbury hui to decide how to deal with issues in their community
9065981 highbury has now become associated with sports with alternative education with planning for employment and with academic and scholarship success
9065982 one of the most exciting developments of this project has been the partnership between massey university the highbury community centre and the tertiary education commission in creating role models for the future
9065983 and so i mihi to praise lisa kimura mihikore davis jonathon howe veronica tawhai and her brothers ruepena and daniel teresa ngaruhe and all of the other incredible young people that have grown up in this community and gone out to strive to reach the stars to achieve their personal and global potential

9065990 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
9065991 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
9065992 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
9065993 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
9065994 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
9065995 sophisticated parties represented by counsel in an transaction negotiated a settlement agreement that included clear and broad waiver of reliance and release of claims language

9066099 the establishment of a new international economic order entails fundamental changes in political social cultural and other aspects of society changes which would bring about a new international order
9066100 addresses the following question what new international order should be recommended to the worlds statesmen and social groups so as to meet to the extent practically and realistically possible the urgent needs of todays population and the probable needs of future generations
9066101 many in the rio group believe that this equitable social order could best be described as humanistic socialism
9066102 society must also deliberately aim at creating employment for all those seeking it and at ensuring that the distribution over different types of jobs achieves a balance between the satisfaction derived from the job and the satisfaction of the needs of society the latter necessitates that certain unpleasant heavy dirty dangerous activities be performed if these activities can be learnt relatively easily they could be performed by all citizens their efforts could be organized in the form of land or neighbourhood armies for work in rural areas in the field of environmental care
9066103 a full employment policy should be adopted by all governments as part of their development plan
9066104 as a counterpart to these rights a number of duties must be accepted especially the duty to use ones capacities in the interest of an adequate level of production
9066105 public power should be used to ensure that education is geared to meet the needs of individuals and the needs of society that is all individuals the supply of qualified types of labour should be so planned as to equal to the greatest extent possible the demand for them by society i e by the organizers of production
9066106 effective application of public power implies the need for middle and long range planning at different levels the un economic and social council might be best suited for undertaking such a task perhaps assisted by the un development planning committee
9066107 at the highest level the level of world affairs international institutions must form the prime movers of planned change
9066108 the optimum utilization of human and physical resources in the world as a whole
9066109 one of the basic questions which today faces the international community is whether it should accelerate the process of this evolution and consciously put in place the various elements of a system for global planning and the management of resources the achievement of this global planning and management system calls for the conscious transfer of power a gradual transfer to be sure from the nation state to the world organization only when this transfer takes place can the organization become effective and purposeful
9066110 new forms of cooperation between private initiative and public authorities will have to be characterized by a certain balance of power
9066111 in the trade field an international trade and development organization formed by expanding the responsibilities of unctad united nations conference on trade and development should be set up with a very broad mandate for overall coordination of policy issues relating to international trade in primary commodities and manufactured goods likewise unidos united nations industrial development organization responsibilities should be increased to enable it to participate in the planning of a more equitable world industrial order
9066112 this third world development implies that if a new international order is to be created the rich nations must be prepared to give up part of their future productive capacity to be able to do this smoothly they will need to resort to adjustment policies and such policies must form part of their development strategies the creation of an optimal international division of labour and as such the selective development of economic activities in third world countries calls for the substantial extension of such adjustment policies it is no longer desirable that the industrialized countries adopt policies of protecting their labour intensive industries in the manufacturing sector rather they should seek as must the third world to develop those industries in which they have a comparative advantage the process described albeit with distortions is already taking place some sectors of western manufacturing industry are moving to third world countries the movement of western european garment industries to north africa is a case in point as such private initiative will no doubt prove responsible for a large part of the adjustment required that adjustments are at present insufficient is witnessed by the millions of workers who migrate from the third world to seek employment in the western industrialized nations to the extent that the adjustments brought about by private initiative on the strength of international market forces will be inadequate and in view of the fact that private enterprises may not be sufficiently creative nor responsive to the needs of countries adjustment must be stimulated and guided by selective taxes and subsidies subsidies should be offered to those industries with a clear potential for contributing to a countrys or a regions development efforts such subsidies could aim at supporting changes where necessary in the production mix of enterprises to ensure the effectiveness of adjustment policies there is a clear need for coordination of policies both between the industrialized countries and between public authorities and the private sector
9066113 the industrialized countries on their part will have to introduce
9066114 in the long term transnational enterprises will still form part of the world structure in either their present form of private enterprises or in a renovated form comprising genuine international ventures
9066115 the possibility of genuine internationalization of some transnational enterprises or transnational operations should be further investigated they could be owned controlled and managed by an international development authority the pharmaceutical industry could be used as an initial test case for analysis because of its international social implications
9066116 active sharing of benefits of the ocean with particular regard to the needs of the less developed countries through a variety of devices including international public enterprises especially for fishing and offshore oil production international tax on ocean uses etc
9066117 the rich nations must develop new consumption styles which are less wasteful less resource intensive and geared to the consumption of social services rather than of superfluous consumer durables
9066118 growth in equality would make it less difficult for people to accept the principle of self restraint in the satisfaction of material needs the ideological cornerstone of the future steady state it would equally create the necessary social conditions for self control of family size and the consequent reduction in population pressure birth control campaigns are likely to remain largely ineffective unless enforced by coercion which is clearly unacceptable up to the time that peasants are freed from material insecurity that infant mortality rates go down and that the use of unpaid child labour is no longer necessary to make ends meet
9066119 ultimately they must aim to construct their policies on a series of maxima which define an appropriate style of civilized living in a world of deprivation and declare that all consumption beyond that fixed maxima is not only waste but a conscious action against the welfare of large numbers of poor and disprivileged their own children and the prospects for a peaceful world
9066120 the statutes of transnational enterprises should be under the supervision of and their profits taxed by an inter or supranational authority
9066121 in the long term and assuming progress towards the creation of an equitable international economic and social order leading to a pooling of material and non material resources mineral resources will need to be viewed as a common heritage of mankind this concept implies both a real world market for all mineral resources and a system of world taxation to replace national mining taxation the revenues collected should be redistributed among third world countries possibly through such an agency as ida international development association world bank group this tax could for instance be introduced as one of a moderate rate and gradually be raised to something in the order of 70 per cent of profits on fossil fuels and 50 per cent of the value of production of ores including uranium such a tax would like the present taxes on oil products in fact be paid by the consumers such a tax at the rates proposed would probably induce consumers to restrict their consumption of mineral raw materials
9066122 it is now recognized that a more elaborate system of careful husbandry and management of raw materials and scarce resources is inevitable
9066123 public opinion is no phenomenon sui generic it is in part the result of government policies and by definition politicians cannot hide behind their own creation if some sectors of public opinion in the industrialized countries are immersed in the rhetoric and slogans associated with misunderstanding then much of this may be inherited from their political leaders and if these leaders are in part responsible for a situation which impedes acceptance of the need for change then they themselves must be held responsible for changing this situation
9066124 a number of measures have been proposed which should bring greater planning and coordination in the field of domestic food production and international supplies of food including the establishment of world grain reserves in the last analysis it may require the setting up of a world food authority to supervise this vital area of human activity and survival
9066125 it takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good
9066126 this is all documented and planned it isnt a conspiracy any more none of it is
9066127 it takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good

9066143 the federal government should be rewarding companies for finding oil or for coming up with new ideas to replace oil we are not the country that congress sees we are a country that solves problems we are not a country that creates them if we continue down this path it will not be republicans versus democrats or capitalists against environmentalists it will be the people against the government theyve got to wake up we the people have got to wake them up speak up

9066153 our aim is for every single school to welcome children from all backgrounds it is a simple goal strongly supported by the public educationalists and students
9066154 there are those who attend church in order that their children qualify for admission to a particular school and never set foot in the church again after the children have been accepted
9066155 all children regardless of their religion culture and family income should have equal access to the best possible education in a good local school
9066156 allowing schools to pick and choose pupils is not the best way to achieve this or to create young adults with the confidence and personal skills to live and work in our vibrant multi cultural society
9066157 parents should be able to choose the type of education and ethos they want for their children the bottom line is that faith schools are successful thriving popular and here to stay
9066158 it is down to locally accountable councils and communities themselves not some campaign group to decide what sort of schools they should have

9066166 this is an exciting opportunity for sars working with a leading public utility and erp software company in china and a leading low power wireless networking technology company from the u s provides sars with the opportunity to establish itself in the emerging chinese market we estimate the market potential in china to be approximately 500 000 000 with 1 000 000 tanks spread over 30 000 farms throughout china

9066194 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9066195 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9066196 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9066197 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9066198 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
9066199 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema
9066200 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9066201 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9066202 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9066203 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9066204 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9066205 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9066206 quando il governo ci ha prospettato in parlamento alcune questioni che noi ritenevamo utili agli italiani sottolinea cesa abbiamo tenuto un atteggiamento positivo quando invece si trattato di opporci come e accaduto per il dpef abbiamo assunto una posizione critica
9066207 una riforma organica che non sia rivolta contro qualcuno ma guardi agli interessi dei cittadini
9066208 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9066209 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
9066210 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni
9066211 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9066212 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9066213 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9066214 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9066215 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9066216 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9066217 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano
9066218 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9066219 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9066220 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9066221 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9066222 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9066223 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9066224 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale
9066225 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat
9066226 i think god is reminding us that on the eve of katrina god can bring nature back
9066227 a good thing about the mausoleums is that caskets can be removed later if a family should come forth and want to bury them themselves
9066228 we decided not to look backward we decided to look forward with all the progress weve made
9066229 i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9066230 weve got our work cut out this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9066231 weve got to rediscover the zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment
9066232 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9066233 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9066234 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9066235 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti

9066247 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you for eighteen long months you have stood up one by one and said enough to the politics of the past you understand that in this election the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result you have shown what history teaches us that at defining moments like this one the change we need doesnt come from washington change comes to washington change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time america this is one of those moments
9066248 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first

9066335 el estado no est obligado a imponer el velo a las mujeres musulmanas y por lo tanto tampoco puede impedir su uso
9066336 est en situaci n de infracci n de uno de los principios de derechos humanos cuando impide el uso del velo

9066338 las investigaciones llevadas a cabo por las fuerzas de seguridad sobre esta fuga se centran en la posibilidad de que stos contaran con ayuda en el interior y exterior de la prisi n
9066339 yo creo que hay una convicci n err nea por parte del estado que considera el uso del velo como un s mbolo pol tico o que puede ser una amenaza a la seguridad eso no es verdad
9066340 en todo caso el estado no debe tomar una decisi n contraria a las libertades individuales

9066355 i freaking hate politics its all trying to cure cancer with ointment
9066356 the first or second law of thermodynamics i just cant remember which one theres three
9066357 matter and energy can not be created or destroyed just changed or converted from one form to another
9066358 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9066359 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9066360 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9066361 in a national commercial shawn needs to keep her taco to herself they probably asked
9066362 i dont know we are all searching searching for some reason of existance some purpose of life
9066363 have you ever thought about why no one finds anything suppose it doesnt exist
9066364 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9066365 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9066366 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9066367 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9066368 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9066369 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9066370 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9066371 who are open to doing something on the production side
9066372 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9066373 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9066374 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9066375 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9066376 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9066377 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9066378 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9066379 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9066380 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9066381 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9066382 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9066383 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9066384 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9066385 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9066386 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9066387 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9066388 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9066389 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9066390 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9066391 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9066392 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9066393 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9066394 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9066395 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9066396 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9066397 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9066398 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9066399 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9066400 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9066401 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9066402 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9066403 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9066404 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9066405 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9066406 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9066407 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9066408 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9066409 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9066410 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9066411 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9066412 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9066413 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9066414 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9066415 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9066416 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9066417 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9066418 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9066419 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9066420 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9066421 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9066422 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9066423 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9066424 she called me and i saw the time it was 3 a m in tel aviv
9066425 but he couldnt have been there or ying wouldnt have called me
9066426 we are pleased to notify you that many fine pianos used in our department of music are now available for purchase these include grand pianos baby grands studios consoles and digital pianos

9066431 swimsuits have to be hiked up at the sides to make their legs look longer
9066432 it is hardly necessary to waste words over the so called bikinis since it is inconceivable that any girl with tact and decency would ever wear such a thing
9066433 actress ursula andress fills wet bikinis as if she were going downwind behind twin spinnakers
9066434 it is for perfect figures only and for the very young
9066435 we have a 250 000 home what are we going to do with it in this market were really in a hard place
9066436 people arent even coming to school now because they dont think theyll get credit
9066437 those are the ones that will suffer so we want to help them out as much as we can
9066438 during a particularly non exciting part of hancock something started nagging at me i just wasnt feeling this not just the movie but hot future doctor hes attractive hes sweet hes funny successful and hes clearly driven ive known him forever i enjoy his company were great friends and the sex has always been fantastic but theres something missing for lack of a better word butterflies
9066439 ta itu med den oj mlika f rdelningen av av makt pengar och resurser den bakomliggande orsaken till dessa dagliga levnadsf rh llanden globalt nationellt och lokalt
9066440 weve been concerned about the falling number of customers all year
9066441 twice this summer the business has dropped off a cliff at one point we really wondered what we were going to do
9066442 what we have done is play down the wow factor on our website and play up the genuine value factor thats what people are interested in now
9066443 were doing a lot more basic work and fewer luxury projects before the downturn we did more swimming pool extensions and home cinemas now the balance has shifted to schemes such as garage conversions and home offices
9066444 possibly but people are also trying to work more from home to cut down on travel costs
9066445 weve just converted a garage into an office for a lady in sussex who will be working from home two days a week it was a double garage and weve used the part closest to the house which already had a connecting door
9066446 it was also reasonably low cost at a total of 15 000
9066447 i think were all right because although the number of people contacting us is down were finding theyre focused about what they want
9066448 theyre more likely to see a project through rather than just flirting with an idea
9066449 its a tough time for us visitor numbers are down
9066450 and with people staying put instead of moving house what they come here to buy has changed
9066451 the higher spending customer profile has altered there are fewer people ready to spend thousands to furnish a room
9066452 buy to let was a big boom here in manchester people would come in for a pack for a whole apartment but that side of the business has slowed right down
9066453 a year ago sofa sales were high as many as 100 a week at this store now people might freshen up a room with a sofa cover or curtains instead
9066454 bright coloured fabrics are selling maybe people want to be cheered up when the economy is gloomy
9066455 one area doing better for us is kitchens as people who cant sell upgrade and anything to do with storage kitchen sales are up by 20 per cent and weve given that side of the business more space in the store
9066456 people used to come for a day out picking up whatever took their fancy now they spend less time in the store and are clear about what they want customers are a lot more savvy when things are tight
9066457 el objetivo de hacer este an lisis comparativo que en realidad no est subyugado a ninguna posici n pol tica el objetivo primordial ha sido poner a disposici n de la ciudadan a ecuatoriana herramientas para que tomen una posici n fija
9066458 esa no es tampoco nuestra posici n tal vez indirectamente se pueda llegar a esa conclusi n pero nosotros de ninguna manera queremos ser un referente para que la ciudan a vote no
9066459 tenemos una versi n pre comisi n de redacci n y una post entre las competencias que se le da a esta comisi n de redacci n esta incluir omisiones obvias establecer contradicciones e incluso cuestiones de terminol gica la comparaci n no quiere decir que se han extralimitado o no porque en tal caso la asamblea constituyente al votar ratific eso lo legitim
9066460 queremos evidenciar con este trabajo cuales son las diferencias jur dicas que se han presentando lo que nosotros queremos es resaltar las agregaciones y derogaciones de los textos
9066461 en el art culo 130 del ltimo proyecto presentado se agregan dos causales por la cuales la asamblea nacional puede destituir al presidente de la rep blica en el proyecto del 19 de julio no contaba que se puede destituir al presidente de la rep blica por haber cometido delitos contra la seguridad del estado y por delitos de cohecho peculado y enriquecimiento il cito y esas desaparecen en el proyecto
9066462 en realidad si lo puede ser pero no podr an la asamblea nacional destituirlo por juicio pol tico si el presidente es acusado o juzgado perder a el ejerci de derechos pol ticos y por tanto no podr a ejercer la presidencia de la rep blica por ello esto podr a ser una diferencia jur dicamente l gica
9066463 el art culo 132 del proyecto del 24 de julio agrega dos casos m s en los cuales se requerir ley en el caso de regular el ejercicio de los derechos de garant as constitucionales y atribuir deberes competencias a los rganos aut nomos descentralizados estos dos casos que requer an de la expedici n de una ley no fueron contemplados en el proyecto del 19 de julio
9066464 para elegir jueces y juezas de la corte nacional no se establec a en el proyecto del 19 de julio un procedimiento y la comisi n para el del 24 lo agrego se entender a que si no se estipula esto se lo delegar a la ley y despu s ratificado por la asamblea fija un procedimiento y crea un marco por la ley
9066465 un inciso mas dice las juezas y jueces ser n elegidos por el consejo de la judicatura conforme a un procedimiento de oposici n y m rito impugnaci n y control social se propenda a la pariedad entre hombre y mujer
9066466 establec a que los consejeros y consejeras principales y suplentes de consejo de participaci n ciudan a durar an cinco a os en sus funciones en el proyecto del 24 de julio ya no se establece no ponen un termino de duraci n de sus funciones y como tal queda redactado
9066467 en el juicio pol tico seg n la primera versi n la sanci n por la asamblea nacional era causal de destituci n para los ministros era una sanci n definitiva en el ltimo proyecto ya no aparece esto queda la censura pero queda a discrecionalidad del presidente de la rep blica la destituci n
9066468 el art culo 422 del 19 de julio dice que se debe ratificar los tratados por iniciativa ciudadana o por el presidente de la rep blica y la realizaci n de una consulta popular o refer ndum para la ratificaci n de estos tratados en el proyecto del 24 de julio la ratificaci n de los tratados se podr pedir exclusivamente por refer ndum por iniciativa ciudadana o por presidente de la rep blica eliminan la consulta popular
9066469 en el proyecto del 19 de julio la disposici n transitoria primera determina que en un plazo de 180 d as contados desde la entrada de vigencia de la constituci n aprobar a la ley que desarrolla el r gimen de soberan a alimentaria en el proyecto del 24 de julio se reduce ese t rmino o ese plazo de 180 a 120 d as y adem s de la expedici n de la ley agregaron otras en los 120 d as tienen que expedir el congresillo antes de las elecciones de la asamblea nacional la ley electoral la ley regulatoria de funci n judicial del consejo de la judicatura y la ley que regula el consejo de participaci n ciudadana y control social
9066470 cuando tuvimos el primer texto del 19 de julio comenzamos a hacer el estudio comparativo con la constituci n del 98 y esa era nuestro primer an lisis y all bamos a para nuestro trabajo no obstante al momento de ingresar de nuevo a la p gina de la asamblea encontramos otro texto
9066471 we had looked at property in france for a few years
9066472 we came across this dilapidated stone and timber house with a third of an acre of land and a stone barn which we both fell in love with immediately we bought it on first viewing
9066473 that makes a mockery of leaving it to them in the first place
9066474 but howard liked the idea of a castle and we decided to go for it a mad moment
9066475 i would not touch this place i think theyre mad
9066476 it will last for hundreds of years its something for the community
9066477 the locals point out that no italian would have taken on a project like this
9066478 i wouldnt do something like this again once is enough but it was very rewarding
9066479 we were thinking of getting out of london it was meant to be a castle in ireland but we liked the idea of tuscany
9066480 it sits on top of a steep castle mound and there are lots of courtyards
9066481 i believe it has one of the most spectacular views in italy over a lake and mountains
9066482 we had to go through the most stringent planning procedure we were hugely constrained as we had to rebuild along the original wall lines
9066483 thankfully we found traces of old arches so the planners allowed us to put five large windows into the living room
9066484 this is how hannibal must have felt watching his elephants come over the alps
9066485 it could end up being a terrible exercise in pastiche
9066486 howard and janne have won every battle they fought and it is their integrity which gives this building its integrity
9066487 there were times we thought wed taken on too much but by that stage we were so deep in and wed spent so much money on it that we couldnt afford to stop
9066488 anda sudah bisa berbahasa jepang kenapa mau belajar lagi dengan kami
9066489 kami tidak ada program studi sejarah tapi kami terkenal dengan fakultas pendidikannya dan memang benar ynu terkenal dengan fakultas pendidikannya tinggal sekarang kamu mau meneliti dari sejarahnya atau pendidikannya
9066490 ok kan pameran masih ada sampai besok bicarakan dulu kalau memang berminat bawa saja berkasnya besok ke sini lagi
9066491 its hard to be religious when certain people are never incinerated by bolts of lightning
9066492 gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9066493 she shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9066494 gov palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade
9066495 the last thing women need is a president and vice president who are prepared to turn back the clock on womens rights and repeal the protections of roe v wade
9066496 when as many as three supreme court justices could be appointed in the first term of the next president and john mccain promises to appoint more scalias and thomases and end a womans right to choose it is time for a change
9066497 in an era when over 80 percent of downs syndrome babies are aborted the palins feel they have been extremely blessed by god to raise an absolutely perfect son
9066498 gov palin continues to use her testimony to advance protections for unborn children
9066499 will i get a nominee who will keep his word to me in the vetting process if any word is actually given
9066500 we all know that dance nobody actually admits they ask the roe question and the question doesnt get asked and it doesnt get answered and therefore the nominees get on the bench and they do what they want
9066501 turkey is a nato member and is also a neighbor of georgias and great supporter of georgia both economically and militarily
9066502 and turkey controls the passage from and to the black sea therefore whatever happens next turkey is going to find itself impacted by the developments
9066503 our trade is over 10 billion and we are overly dependent on russian gas at 64 percent and 40 percent for russia oil
9066504 for the moment i see it as an empty shell and as a good will gesture if anything comes out of it will be good and if nothing comes out of it no one will blame turkey
9066505 it is better than what the europeans can and would do anyway
9066506 he was an ordinary business salesman running a company and a family man he was just an ordinary everyday chap well dressed a good businessman
9066507 we are devastated this just does not happen to your own family it is like something you see on television
9066508 there is no one who disliked her everyone got along with her she had no enemies
9066509 a unique capacity to lead our increasingly diverse nation and to restore our leadership in an ever more interdependent world
9066510 as long as im doing the splits that means im healthy
9066511 when im not doing the splits you know theres something wrong
9066512 im not too sure about my body if i go into a split who knows if ill come back up
9066513 i wish i didnt have any drama in my matches i wish i would win nice and in a simple way
9066514 who likes drama do you know anybody that likes to get involved into tight matches
9066515 the most unsophisticated chokehold that any judo instructor would completely despise you for ever using
9066516 and this is the kind of choke that people who have no martial skills at all would employ and um and yet it uh uh was completely painless for her
9066517 every human life is sacred and i took her life
9066518 im very sorry for that i dont think ill be able to make up to society for what ive done but ill try to the extent that i can
9066519 and im very sorry for the terrible harm ive caused my children ill try to contribute to society while in prison
9066520 for the time that ive wasted for all the people who worked very hard to convict me of my crime
9066521 in a grave where her children will be able to come and talk to her instead of in the dirt of the oakland hills
9066522 was the right thing to do it brings a lot of closure
9066523 know where nina is for sure theres no question about it now
9066524 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9066525 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9066526 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9066527 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9066528 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9066529 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9066530 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9066531 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9066532 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9066533 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9066534 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9066535 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9066536 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9066537 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9066538 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9066539 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9066540 shes a democrat she must prove she loves america as opposed to republicans who everyone knows love america they just hate half the people living in it
9066541 we are thrilled to be bringing our customers partners employees and other industry experts back together in las vegas for parafest 09

9066546 oh thats so sweet its like a gift from your dad
9066547 all of our principals sign an agreement with us saying if their school gets a d or an f two years in a row or three cs in a row we can remove them
9066548 we also reward those schools and those principals and teachers who get good results by giving them additional pay
9066549 ive shut down 70 schools brought in a new principal who selected a new team and they are operating in a more effective way
9066550 we had high schools that had a 30 per cent graduation rate i shut those schools down and replaced them with smaller high schools in the same building and some of those schools now have a 70 or 80 per cent graduation rate
9066551 we believe that the executions were an isolated incident and not part of a strategy to destabilise the state
9066552 its not about looking for who was guilty in the past were all responsible
9066553 border between the state of lebanon and the state of hezbollah
9066554 it is not a joke but a life risk to follow the path of martyrs of democracy like shaheed bhutto and mohtarma benazir bhutto
9066555 there is some kind of engagement to have some understanding of where we are because its not clear whether the talks have collapsed or are still on
9066556 the mediator has to help us appreciate where we are in terms of locating a way forward
9066557 we are trying with mbeki to get zanu pf to be flexible because there has not been any indication of movement of flexibility on the part of zanu pf
9066558 just with the south african mediators there is no zanu pf
9066559 we hope the talks can lead to the finalisation of the political and outstanding matters so that we can start with a normalisation of the political economic and humanitarian situation in zimbabwe
9066560 unless there is a political solution we dont have the necessary framework to deal with the economic recovery package for zimbabwe and the humanitarian crisis
9066561 it will be determined by the progress made they will continue until all parties feel they have covered sufficient ground
9066562 hindu and christian peace committees have been meeting and the leaders have appealed for calm
9066563 we want that violence should be stopped immediately to restore peace and normalcy in the violence affected areas
9066564 there is reason to suspect that an investigation may reveal serious and complex fraud
9066565 its very clear to me and very clear to him that the appropriate thing is for him to stand aside from his portfolios while the serious fraud office conducts its investigation
9066566 mr peters is offering his total co operation to the sfo and the first meeting between his lawyers and the office will take place tomorrow saturday morning
9066567 i think the point is shooting guns in itself is not bad or good it is just an activity guns can be used for bad shooting random people or good defending yourself same with hacking
9066568 bad guy who breaks into computers steals things and causes harm
9066569 i am a hacker but probably not in the way that you use the word
9066570 i hope all my fellow children who lost limbs can get out of gaza and get artificial limbs
9066571 i hope the entire world follows the example of this group of activists who broke the siege
9066572 its very bad there its like a prison i wish for freedom in palestine
9066573 we have been informed that if the dharna at singur continues for another 48 hours supply of medicine is going to be severely hit
9066574 our distributors have informed us that their stocks are dwindling the supply is cut off so nobody has any idea when the trucks are going to arrive
9066575 if the supplies don t arrive fast we will be in trouble

9066578 we have not been told of the possibility of any shortage in medicine supply as of now we are well stocked but must be prepared for any eventuality
9066579 we are trying to distribute the medicines being carried by large trucks into smaller vehicles that can pass through alternative roads but refrigerated vehicles will have to be arranged we are trying to avoid a drug crisis

9066590 governor palin has always answered the call to serve and done so for the right reasons she has demonstrated executive leadership in every office shes held and actually has a record of getting results to back it up
9066591 women who have been in politics a lot longer than i were fixed to televisions and moved to tears upon seeing that governor palin had been chosen to be our vice presidential nominee the excitement here is incredible and it is because her selection signifies real change for the republican party and for the united states

9066597 yo creo que cuando un ni o como herbert f sica y mentalmente discapacitado viene al mundo una oportunidad de ver como la naturaleza humana se presenta y se manifiesta en la forma en la que otras personas tratan a ese ni o
9066598 su padre sab a que a la mayor a de los ni os no les gustar a que alguien como herbert jugara en su equipo pero el padre tambi n entendi que si le permit an jugar a su hijo le dar an un sentido de pertenencia muy necesario y la confianza de ser aceptado por otros a pesar de sus habilidades especiales el padre de herbert se acerco a uno de los ni os que estaban jugando y le pregunto sin esperar mucho si herbert podr a jugar el ni o miro alrededor por alguien que lo aconsejara y le dijo estamos perdiendo por seis carreras y el juego esta en la octava entrada supongo que puede unirse a nuestro equipo y trataremos de ponerlo al bate en la novena entrada

9066609 nie waren handwerklich und ethisch gut ausgebildete journalisten notwendiger als heute um das berleben des qualit tsjournalismus in der digitalen welt zu sichern

9066613 my first 365 days at fort hood i spent 276 out in field training doing maneuver exercises gunnery training from time to time going out to the national training center in california doing large training exercises with hundreds of vehicles aircraft helicopters jets artillery it gets pretty intense theres really not too much you can compare it to
9066614 the cold war was still going on and i wanted to face that threat from the soviet union
9066615 i joined the army in 1989 and about two months after i got in i walked into the barracks i was enlisted at the time and a bunch of guys were watching tv and i said hey what are you watching and someone said the berlin wall came down and i said you gotta be kidding me so my story now is that gorbachev heard i joined the army and he gave up
9066616 you know you look at john mccain 22 years in the navy former pow and all his congressional experience and stack that up against barack obama i think the choice is clear there
9066617 a big section was closed off many people were killed there
9066618 when you check in youre going through a metal detector just like at an airport when you put your bags through x ray just to get inside and there were soldiers outside with machine guns and you can see on the faces of the staff that theyre still shell shocked from what happened
9066619 it doesnt matter what country it is whats the issue security jobs taxes services roads you can translate so many things that are happening in the u s to whats happening in these other countries at the very local level
9066620 its fun to be able to tell these people hey we face similar challenges in a sense we as the trainers become ambassadors for the u s and they get to talk to a real american and hear what its like from just a normal person
9066621 theyre usually more inexperienced they dont have money they dont necessarily have a volunteer base and having a presidential campaign out there brings in more volunteers so were able to funnel these new volunteers into these local races
9066622 im honored greatly because im just 39 years old and there are a lot of people who have done a lot more for the party
9066623 i got to meet all kinds of people and see folks that you see on the news its a big american party is what it is

9066628 like this observing and nothing more because its very dangerous we prefer being up here watching saying hello to friends and having a good time
9066629 foment a greater understanding and appreciation of californias unique flora
9066630 upon which side shall the democratic party fight upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital or upon the side of the struggling masses
9066631 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome
9066632 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
9066633 we want people who want to make their mark here
9066634 with a new building attached to the old it created anxiety for everyone including the seniors because nobody truly knew where they were going
9066635 that helped alleviate stress and today we took another slow start to the morning and each received a colored map
9066636 we talked a lot about patience patience is key and were off to a good start
9066637 the basic theory is that to be seen whether with a radar or with the naked eye or with some other instrument some kind of light or radio wave or something has to travel from the batmobile to the observer or the observers equipment the stealth technology minimizes how much of that energy travels to the observer thus minimizing the chance that the observer will see it
9066638 light that is incident on an object is either absorbed into the object transmitted through the object or reflected off the object of course light can be emitted from the object as well we can turn the batmobiles lights off so it is not emitting light and realistically the batmobile is not going to transmit light through itself so the question becomes one of maximizing how much light is absorbed and minimizing how much is reflected in a manner useful to someone trying to see it
9066639 yes and so does the finish on the batmobile also the material on the surface helps a great deal as well different materials have different coefficients of absorptivity transmissivity and reflectivity these properties also depend on whether it is visible light infrared light radio waves and so on
9066640 just like the various vehicles down here so do the batsuits have some of this technology incorporated into them and just like the vehicles the different suits are optimized for different environments hot and cold environments environments with uv or ir radiation and so on
9066641 in addition to all that different things can be used to trick an observer there are things that obstruct an observers line of sight to a target such as a building or some trees smoke and clouds work well and where there isnt anything like that we can make smoke there are decoys to cause the observer to lose track of what he is trying to follow and pyrotechnic devices to distract him you can also impede an observers ability to watch you tear gas for example can cause someone great difficulties in trying to see where you are
9066642 lights and mirrors give me the right combination of lights and mirrors and i can make you think that the batmobile is a bush and a bush is the batmobile add in these other tricks and it gets very complicated for the other guy
9066643 speaking of tricks and complications master bruce that was not a very smart trick of yours bringing talia al ghul back to the batcave last night
9066644 i didnt see that i had a lot of choices alfred she just kind of wandered into the fray and i had to do something to save her
9066645 and that something was to bring her back to the batcave
9066646 where talia al ghul has been her father is certain to follow with company
9066647 yeah i suppose but more importantly im interested in not having this batman around any more
9066648 dont worry nick mr falcone said some friends of his are going to take care of him
9066649 bruce you knew that bringing her back here would mean her father would come here with his henchmen
9066650 ras al ghul has suspected for a long time the connection between batman and bruce wayne in fact i think suspected is far too weak of a word
9066651 the knights of the round table wore shining armor but you shall be a dark knight and your armor shall be dark you shall be a creature of the shadows and of the night your heart will be pure and your works will be good yet your existence and your reputation will strike terror in the hearts of those who do evil and it is through this terror that you shall be victorious
9066652 in a world darkened by the overcast of evil one man will emerge a warrior and in defense of justice he will work magic
9066653 sir do you have a dollar bill i can have for four quarters
9066654 the u s economy expanded faster than previously estimated in the second quarter helped by a surge in exports that will probably wane as europe and japan head toward recessions
9066655 the expansion is likely to weaken in the second half as consumers burdened with falling home values and dwindling job prospects rein in spending separate figures today showed the number of americans collecting unemployment benefits reached a five year high last week
9066656 u s economic growth in the second quarter was much stronger than previously believed but it could represent the high water mark for the economy for at least the next year
9066657 weak banks exhausted consumers and cautious hiring are expected to drag down growth in coming quarters and with no end in sight for the drop in house prices economists are unable to see an end to the financial market stress that is holding back activity
9066658 crash proof how to profit from the coming economic collapse
9066659 youll take this as very bad news indeed if you read any of quite a few of the investment newsletters i follow their editors have recently been making a big deal out of septembers supposed tendency to be bad for the stock market but should you change your behavior because of this historical tendency
9066660 so some rational investors are beginning to see value emerging but it will take a while for the markets confidence to be rebuilt
9066661 the dollar has moved powerfully higher since it bottomed out against the major currencies and a respite is in order
9066662 the steady and steep decline in spot natural gas prices this summer abruptly ended this report week with the advent of gustav a tropical storm which is forecast to reach hurricane status shortly and appears to be tracking toward the u s gulf coast while landfall would not occur until early next week cities such as new orleans are already preparing evacuations from the perspective of the energy industry crews would need to be airlifted from offshore platforms and rigs natural gas production likely would be temporarily shut in but the extent and duration of lost production capacity is still speculative

9066668 every fundamental reason that gold is sought as a safe haven is still growing in importance
9066669 the dollars ills havent been cured in fact we havent seen the worst of the currencys decline
9066670 you dont make money buying when youre optimistic you have to actually run completely counter to your own emotional psychology its easy to talk about being smart in theory but extremely tough to apply in practice when its real money and youre scared but what am i doing now im buying
9066671 800 gold is nothing but a buying opportunity grab some cash jeff and head to the local coin dealer while its still on the sale rack
9066672 will i have enough money to last the rest of my life

9066674 just like normal we left for the weekend thinking well be back

9066678 oh wow with everyone in the stands id have to get lets see a second third fourth fifth sixth seventh eight ninth job to pay for it
9066679 its not about money its about sending a message everything burns
9066680 you squeezed them you hammered them and in their desperation they turned to a man they didnt fully understand
9066681 ysee madness as you know is like gravity all it takes is a little push
9066682 but the fact of the matter is katrina taught us all a lesson
9066683 if we take a direct hit we will not be receiving evacuees from louisiana
9066684 we will be receiving southern alabama evacuees as far up as huntsville well be hosting them sheltering them setting up medical needs shelters anything we need to do to help our citizens in the state of alabama
9066685 i think there are still a few rooms scattered throughout birmingham but not many
9066686 now i have people calling in favors saying do we have rooms we have nothing
9066687 john mccain bio has run a series of negative ads and they have worked there is no question that people have some doubts about senator obama they did not have a month ago and in kind senator obama has responded
9066688 he needs to say i am for low taxes i am pro life i am pro family i am for an energy policy that will help the people of the united states and that means drilling wherever
9066689 a comprehensive review by state wildlife officials of scientific information from a broad range of climate ice and polar bear experts
9066690 its like asking somebody to construct a stadium without giving them a blueprint
9066691 unfortunately with her support for drilling in the arctic refuge and off our coasts will simply continue the failed policies of the bush cheney administration and their big oil friends policies that could make us even more dependent on foreign oil

9066728 ppr is confident in its outlook for the second half of 2008 and stands by its objectives for growth and improved financial performance
9066729 the worsening economic environment continuing competitive pressure and a slower realisation of the benefits of marketing initiatives
9066730 given the poor outlook on household spending for 2009 we were overly optimistic to expect a return to growth in the sector next spring
9066731 we are increasingly concerned that household expenditure will continue to fall well into 2009 and so pub profitability is unlikely to recover until 2010
9066732 even if it were to become a reit we believe it would trade at a discount to its net asset value given there is some uncertainty about its conversion our target price has been lowered to 270p
9066733 the financing of a potential takeover has been an issue in the past but would be significantly easier if bertelsmann is prepared to dilute its holding in rtl
9066734 strategically we believe it would make sense for rtl bertelsmann to make a move for itv given the lack of scale in the uk market although a disposal of channel five is likely to be required to get regulatory approval for the deal
9066735 poker is still 60 of revenue and with growth sluggish we are downgrading our forecasts more in line with consensus
9066736 the team at ciao has built a passionate consumer community based on intuitive technology and extensive merchant relationships that we believe will deliver incremental benefit to the microsoft live search platform
9066737 guidance is for margins to continue falling and arrears to continue rising earnings outlook is therefore very weak the margin issue is the lack of ability to write new business currently available at higher margins at least in part due to funding constraints
9066738 the boards priority has been to ensure that we can continue to fund our business safely and we have achieved this
9066739 many pensioners already worrying about whether they can afford to heat their homes this winter will be outraged by news of yet more colossal price hikes
9066740 it is a huge worry that one in three pensioner households are likely to be living in fuel poverty by the end of 2008 and many are already feeling forced to cut back on essential food or fuel
9066741 all the major suppliers have increased prices for a second time this year this is a heavy blow and few households will emerge unscathed or unconcerned about the future affordability of their energy
9066742 these are difficult times and we understand the financial impact this announcement will have on our customers although were one of the last companies to announce increases were sorry we couldnt hold on any longer however we have worked very hard to protect people for as long as possible from these considerable increases in the wholesale market
9066743 extremely reluctantly especially as household budgets are being squeezed so much
9066744 there are no specific deadlines but we will try to come to a conclusion as soon as possible if airlines which normally compete get together we have to make sure it is not to the detriment of consumers
9066745 we look forward to showing the commission how our plans will benefit consumers
9066746 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher towards the 120 level
9066747 if this turns out to be a non event the market could really come roaring back down
9066748 even during the cold war regardless of political or any other circumstances the soviet union always fulfilled its contractual obligations to supply europe with energy and russia a responsible and reliable partner adheres to the same principle
9066749 we are the big guys on the street and we will remain in that position
9066750 europe had all the cards they have negotiated in bad faith we have been bullied into this
9066751 we have a number of other major authors across the group
9066752 we have been fortunate enough to have strong cash balances and squander that we will not
9066753 weve seen the end of the very big blockbuster the likes of lipitor
9066754 theres not enough time for a product to become a massive blockbuster theres so much competition in the market
9066755 it takes 550m and 10 12 years to bring a new drug to the patient
9066756 its an investment in public health its only natural that the companies need to make a return on this initial investment
9066757 nice needs to combine pure economic arithmetic with other considerations the severity of the condition the availability of alternative treatments the consequences of refusing treatment in terms of the length and quality of life and the savings in the use of carers
9066758 the idea of early dialogue is now accepted on both sides
9066759 the increased rigour in being able to get a product to market means that far more molecules have to be screened before a likely candidate can be positively identified
9066760 we can expect drug research in large well served areas like pain relief to be reduced
9066761 new drugs for niche conditions are likely to be fantastically expensive in many cases it will seem like blackmail without government assistance or insurance treatment will simply not be affordable for many
9066762 the odds seem lower than in the us but the pressures to enhance drug marketing and co opt the regulators are ever present there is a lot of money at stake
9066763 gsk must change if it is to be successful in the future
9066764 are we still underfunding our health service we get good value for money but if we put more money in would peoples health improve
9066765 tax is one reason but we have had this idea for a long time and see it as a way to internationalise the business

9066770 as those houses get vacant we end up with real problems in our neighborhood
9066771 however now we have a lot of vacancies and because of predatory lending
9066772 people at their lowest have no idea what to do and who to go to
9066773 it is just something that we worked so hard on its a heart felt achievement
9066774 those flicks were awesome my kid has to see these
9066775 senator john mccains choice of sarah palin is thrilling for those of us who labor for issues like the sanctity of life traditional marriage and 2nd amendment rights
9066776 as a lifetime member of the nra and an avid sportswoman we can be assured of her strong support for gun rights finally she is married with 5 kids and has been outspoken about the need for a federal marriage amendment this in fact is the only way to save traditional marriage in our country florida california and arizona will have a marriage amendment on their ballot in november
9066777 we expect that to be added with the october upgrade update
9066778 we agreed to work with sam furrow because he was one of the original campers at camp montvale with the ymca
9066779 he is a great person community leader and has a desire to keep it as a camp and work with harmony
9066780 we played awful defense and awful special teams and we deserved to lose
9066781 thats it in a nutshell we had over 400 yards we deserved to win the football game offensively we didnt deserve anything on defense we didnt tackle we didnt pass rush we didnt do anything defensively
9066782 you saw it coming whoever had that ball last was probably going to end up winning the darn thing
9066783 our sophomore quarterback i give him credit he completed some good passes and chad allemon that was a great catch and run
9066784 god knows we had to make it an issue and let them drive down there
9066785 our guys played super hard hard as can be but theyre not playing super smart right now
9066786 hopefully if my guys learn how to tackle well beat some teams but thats a big if right now
9066787 this is a great group of kids i love them to death but they just dont get it right now
9066788 we had eight guys returning on offense and it was probably obvious that we were probably a little more in sync on offense
9066789 defensively were learning under fire the great thing is though we have an offense that can hopefully bail us out at times and theyre going to have carry the load for the first few weeks theres no doubt about that but what theyre going to do is buy us time to get better and they did that
9066790 it is one of the ultimate races in the world it is also the toughest it takes 15 days of driving 800km 500 miles a day which is pretty hard going there is a lot of mental strain as well before you start you have to get your team together as well as sponsorship its not just a race against others its a test against yourself we live in a nanny state so to go and push your boundaries to the limit is really healthy you see what you can achieve in life if you want something enough at the time its not much fun but the satisfaction you feel afterwards makes it worthwhile even though i didnt finish due to injury i still feel a huge sense of achievement
9066791 i started the festival 21 years ago to establish a worldwide standard for quality of cannabis and its held every thanksgiving growers and breeders come here to compete for the prize of the best harvest if other plants have harvest festivals then why shouldnt cannabis cannabis is one of the planets most revered plants do we have fun sure theres a lot of pot smoking going on
9066792 it can be a great experience to go to ascot but it would not be top of my list of things to do i would rather go surfing in bali or see kangaroos breed in australia or the wonders of the world say than see a lot of people in top hats while it is fun im not sure it should be on the list is it seeing the pyramids at dawn i dont think so it is not in the do or die bracket
9066793 its a very quirky thing to do and its a good conversation starter to say you have been in the bog it is a bizarre experience when youre snorkelling your way through and wondering how on earth you ended up there its dark and you cant see and that is scary you bump into the sides a lot
9066794 the first time i went to the biennale was in 1982 and i thought it was great there is no doubt its one of the best events in the world it has become a model for a lot of other biennales which do similar things biennales are an incredible visual feast certain artists can only be seen at biennales theyre like rock musicians who only play at festivals

9066819 have you ever wondered if your mechanic is charging you a fair price for your auto repair
9066820 what are we looking at a geometry that recalls both the platonic perfect figures and tantric designs the image of the labyrinth rendered as a looping intestinal pattern gestational images of seed and egg drawn into a whole by craftsmanship that brings to mind the skills of jeweler and icon maker
9066821 most manifestations of art today lack good common sense lack relation with a higher reality and lack spiritual purpose
9066822 what can there be of value without a search into oneself linked to essential knowledge
9066823 isnt the ultimate desire of human beings to perceive an order of laws that surpasses us yet is also within us and to participate in that order
9066824 isnt the role of the artist to reflect on and to reflect back something of this greater order for the sake of stimulating the viewer to reconstruct the original idea
9066825 isnt this quest the purpose conscious or unconscious of all artistic effort
9066826 to try to grasp the soul that which animates each thing at its source
9066827 finally what seems most important in the process of painting is the quality of feeling that the artist conveys by doing what he does no matter what subject he chooses and then the care he takes and the quality of attention he communicates which may arouse the same quality in the viewer
9066828 when that quality of energy is there it can be felt it is palpable visible in the canvas it has an action one is touched and one can glimpse the reality behind appearances
9066829 the act of painting can be understood as an act of contemplation of meditation through which the artist can rediscover and remember what is laid down in his deepest nature his primal consciousness and by that very means summon the same in response from the viewer

9066835 we know there were a lot of u s advisers in georgia but instructors teachers and personnel for military weapons should be on firing ranges and in the teaching centres but where were they they were in the zone of military operations
9066836 and that pushes one to the conclusion that the leadership of the united states knew about the action that was being prepared and moreover probably took part in it
9066837 in a significant way the crisis was provoked including by our american friends in the course of the election struggle this was the use of administrative resources in a deplorable way to provide advantage to one of the candidates in the current case from the ruling party
9066838 if the leadership of the united states had sanctioned that then i have the suspicion that it was done specially to organise a small victorious war
9066839 and if it didnt work then to make russia appear like an enemy and on those grounds unite the electorate around one presidential candidate of course the ruling party
9066840 if european countries will continue to act like that then we will have to talk about european affairs with washington

9066843 most of the working class in ghana are below 35 years so we need a policy that would ensure a youthful and skilled human resource base
9066844 it is not right to shed blood because of the electoral process because ghana is seen as the beacon of hope for the african continent towards its march for development
9066845 a political party that has been defeated twice in elections even when the npp was in opposition why should we rig the elections
9066846 when i enlisted into the ghana army in 1960 i learnt that the flagstaff house used to be the official residence of the general officer commanding the ghana armed forces until the prime minister dr

9066856 the debate between those who believe in doing everything including a military operation to prevent iran from getting a nuclear bomb and those who think we can live with iranian nukes has been settled
9066857 if the ayatollahs regime does not fall in the next year if the americans do not strike militarily and if the international sanctions do not break the iranian nuclear plan israel will have to act forcefully

9066925 many pensioners already worrying about whether they can afford to heat their homes this winter will be outraged by news of yet more colossal price hikes
9066926 it is a huge worry that one in three pensioner households are likely to be living in fuel poverty by the end of 2008 and many are already feeling forced to cut back on essential food or fuel
9066927 all the major suppliers have increased prices for a second time this year this is a heavy blow and few households will emerge unscathed or unconcerned about the future affordability of their energy
9066928 these are difficult times and we understand the financial impact this announcement will have on our customers although were one of the last companies to announce increases were sorry we couldnt hold on any longer however we have worked very hard to protect people for as long as possible from these considerable increases in the wholesale market

9066935 people just cant afford to get divorced at the minute
9066936 it could be that husbands will think first before heading for the divorce courts at least until the economic landscape settles particularly as the housing market has been so badly affected in the last few months couples may think twice before divorcing and buying elsewhere
9066937 the reality is that couples split up in all economic climates as we have seen throughout our 70 year history families urgently need easy access to emotional support to manage the fallout from conflict when they separate

9066949 i got a tender off the boat to the shore a taxi for three hours across the island a four seater plane to st lucia a 25 seater to barbados a nine hour delay on the flight from barbados to gatwick then i missed me connecting flight obviously from gatwick to manchester then the transpennine express train from manchester then walked through the door 30 odd hours later and straight on stage
9066950 those people have paid to go in there and have a laugh i hate it when that doesnt happen its not the acts fault ive seen him go down really well elsewhere but thats a tough old room

9066964 i truly believe that people like myself who are in a position of entertainers in the limelight should keep their mouth shut on politics because at the end of the day im good at writing songs and singing what im not educated in is the field of political science and so for me to be sharing my views and influencing people of who i think they should be voting for i think would be very irresponsible on my part

9067006 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat
9067007 i think god is reminding us that on the eve of katrina god can bring nature back
9067008 a good thing about the mausoleums is that caskets can be removed later if a family should come forth and want to bury them themselves
9067009 we decided not to look backward we decided to look forward with all the progress weve made
9067010 nobody knew about his announcement this morning except a traveling aide and the governors chief of staff who found out about this last night
9067011 the fundamental principle behind any selection of a running mate would be whether that person is fully prepared to take over and shares your values your principles your philosophy and your priorities
9067012 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice
9067013 and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
9067014 john mccain followed her career and admired her tenacity and her many accomplishments
9067015 she was scheduled for a high profile speaking role at our convention and included in the vp selection process because of his admiration for her strong reform credentials
9067016 she gave a slightly different answer and left the door slightly open as opposed to shutting down all the speculation up front

9067024 weve been to rankin inuvik dawson city whitehorse it is a really different world people are appreciative of music in these places
9067025 the crowd that you play for is just massively important in how the show goes and the performance
9067026 people kind of expect raise a little hell and sportscar but if theyre really drunk they yell them out anyway
9067027 it runs the gamut requests are generally songs that people think we might not play one song we dont play is live from the moon its just a crazy song to play live so we dont play it
9067028 we spend a lot of time online we are kind of nerd like you dont have to be concerned where you are lately weve all been playing with our iphones
9067029 im still trying to figure out why i do it
9067030 i am questioning the purpose of it at this point theres an old saying first you just do it then you do it for fun then you seriously do it then youre done i might be at that point with it
9067031 im currently negotiating with some people to do a rap version of here for a good time for a benefit for a woman that has cancer
9067032 our old record company universal is talking about doing a new collection of trooper hits there is the possibility that the hip hop version of here for a good time will be on that hit package im trying to coordinate that
9067033 every place you go is a completely different experience every night is an entirely different event stage and audience we dont sound check the first time we see the stage and crowd is when we walk on the stage its kind of like jumping out of a plane thats exciting theres a hundred things that can go wrong and at least two or three that do every night we work through that and not let anybody in the audience know whats going on taking the pulse of the audience every night is a whole different event
9067034 that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character
9067035 the men and women who gathered there couldve heard many things
9067036 they couldve heard words of anger and discord they couldve been told to succumb to the fear and frustrations of so many dreams deferred
9067037 but what the people heard instead people of every creed and colour from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
9067038 its a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will but that we also have obligations to treat each other with dignity and respect
9067039 thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
9067040 what obama didnt do was give an airy abstract dreamy confection of rhetoric
9067041 the mccain campaign set obama up as a celebrity airhead a paris hilton of wealth and elitism
9067042 and he let them portray him that way and let them over reach and let them punch him again and again and then he turned around and destroyed them if the rove republicans thought they were playing with a patsy they just got a reality check
9067043 the gap between expectations and realities in the polls suggests that obama like reagan will be unable to widen his lead significantly unless and until voters judge him as crossing the bar of acceptability as a president
9067044 b ut the underlying terrain of the electorate and the election suggests that voters will move to him in sizable numbers if and when he does
9067045 starts the general election with a large handicap that he has to overcome

9067048 for a century and a half the geological world was dominated one might even say brainwashed by the gradualistic uniformitarianism of charles lyell thats the page where he wrote that you see im not make no comment here but catastrophism seems to return
9067049 we offer no solution to the paradox and this presents a highly intriguing geological problem
9067050 so what triggered plate tectonics in his totally secular model dr baumgartner was looking to see what may have triggered this without inferring any divine causes came to the conclusion that one of the possibilities would be the intrinsic instability of the astenosphere if you imagine planet earth like a huge chemical compound with things as they happen certain changes in phase and density in percentage of certain things change you might reach a critical point at which something happens like for example a change in the astenosphere which causes the initial sinking in the plates just one area and then the whole thing goes as a snowball effect we can also infer obviously a meteorite impact for example which would have just disrupted the balance the very very fragile balance and then triggered the mechanism
9067051 any other questions jy kan in afrikaans ook vra ek sal dit probeer vertaal maar dit gaan nie goed uitkom nie
9067052 other than the two canyons you find the great canyon and the erosion plain under the water what other evidence do you have
9067053 as i said a suggestion as to what happened after the waters covered the land comes from that canyon
9067054 you know you go into the pampas perfectly flat and suddenly you drop into a valley 35km wide no sign of a river you go further about 15km further into it theres another step and then finally you have the flood plains today in which this river flows now but the whole valley could not have been cut by that river much bigger drainage now that we know is connected to the to the ice age but if you look globally and analyze the water i mean the hydrographic networks theyre all the same it looks like they started by the huge drainage of water from the land creating the the basics of it so now the rivers today use it i mean thats of course is circumstantial evidence but its fairly well in tune with the rest and theres more to it of course 04 39 you need to understand that once youve started look into things with a different perspective and its just a few of you and you have hardly any access to the basic information you have to struggle for it its very difficult to do research
9067055 can we maybe ask a last question anybody else lets ask
9067056 if you read certain french glaciologists works like sounds like
9067057 thank you well you see if you analyze dinosaur fossils you notice theres almost identical dinosaurs in alaska and antarctica and since they were exclusively land animals they had to walk on land so you would postulate fairly secure that the pre flood world was a super continent not pangaea that has to do with the wilson cycle and we go to a different destination there 06 12 so its a big chunk of land right now logically the best solution would be to be a strip of land going north south because if you have another distribution the rotation of the planet would be a little bit more complicated well if that was the case you would also postulate that the best solution would be a straight axis to keep the momentum 06 37 now when plate tectonics started as the ocean plates that carried on top of them this continents started sinking here and there they created a tremendous drag which broke this continent into pieces and they were moving at up to 7 metres per second to their new locations now if you look well theres more continental mass in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere right now if you move more mass on the surface of a rotating sphere towards the north obviously the axis is going to tend to tilt northwards and thats exactly how we see it with rotation a bit wobbly 07 11 what do you have now if you tilted the axis suddenly you start having climate zones which you didnt have with a straight axis right 07 22 given the incredible amount of heat dissipated there the precipitations at the end of the flood and throughout the flood and the evaporation following it and then new precipitation was tremendous using existing climatic models you can estimate an average of 2000 mm per square metre almost everywhere on earth this is a tremendous amount of precipitation only that now in the northern high latitudes because you have a tilted axis that will come down as snow if you cover say 30 of the northern hemisphere with a layer of white snow 2 metres per year several years in a row what do you do you suddenly increase the albedo of the planet the whiteness of the planet seen from space which means that you reflect a lot of solar energy back into space and thats going to cause a catastrophic global cooling which ends up within 500 years once again using existing climate models into an ice age so all that sediment all that snow turns into ice so within 500 years after that event you can have maximal ice age which went to a peak and then started melting and it still melts today
9067058 sjoe thank you very much applause well lets give him a hand
9067059 i just wanted to know how old just a personal question if i may how old do you think the world is then but as i say its a bit of a personal question
9067060 well of course heres my answer no its ok of course im what people call a young earth creationist if i accept the flood as a real event a geological event and i have all my reasons to do i do not see how deep time can exist you know so therefore i can operate with 10 000 years or even less you know but of course thats a major shift in paradigm and i am perfectly aware of the fact that were far from having answers to all questions but it is an unfair lets not call it fight although it is a fight i mean you try to reinterperate basically a good chunk of geology not all of it but you do not have access to primary data even more so that access is denied to you so all you have is published stuff you know but we all know that the vast majority of scientists as they publish they already put their bias into it because thats how we work we are just human beings we all do that so it is ideal if you want to change a paradigm so deeply for you to go and see the real thing in the field and then start from there if you cant youre always exposed i mean the data you put into the system is the data that comes out uh controls the quality of the data coming out so thats basically it
9067061 the universe is full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper
9067062 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9067063 it just felt normal just one of those days where i made about a 15 footer on the first hole another on the second hole i just kind of built on that momentum
9067064 its been kind of my goal the last moth or so to get off to better starts in tournaments
9067065 it seems like ive been having to come from behind ive just put it in my to try to get off to a better start obviously this was way exceeding my expectations
9067066 its nuts i dont think theyve got it right quite yet
9067067 how can you have a double major winner not make the tour championship thats complete nonsense
9067068 it was one of the rare days it did feel like that
9067069 but it was one of those days with my putter i hadnt had in a while so it was fun

9067117 one is that diagnosing a disorder like ocd or addiction in the real clinical sense is pretty involved
9067118 id probably say that addiction is not the result of a substance or an activity
9067119 it actually comes from within the person for example take heroin quite a few people are addicted to heroin which is basically a very strong painkiller but there are tons of people who go to hospitals and receive painkillers and dont become addicted
9067120 addiction when diagnosed by a mental health professional is done so on an individual basis
9067121 a therapist gets to the conclusion of addiction by applying quite a few different diagnostics they dont need to look them up usually a good therapist is going to be able to get a sense of the mental mumbo jumbo and suss it out the point is for the layperson theres no safe way that you can tell them if you do x youre addicted because all the criteria out there ideally should only be viewable by these professionals who have some clue of what the f is going on in the brain

9067127 mindset and i contend there is no difference in the mindset at all i notice now that average americans can no longer afford to drive these kinds of vehicles so they are dumping them just like europeans in similar situations
9067128 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9067129 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9067130 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9067131 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9067132 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9067133 the first year i did extremely well i got straight a pluses i didnt know i had a good brain when i was younger
9067134 all the time when i was studying you have these family things going on
9067135 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9067136 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9067137 i feel like i could take on the world and i think the hardest part of this challenge was staying in the same pose for 10 minutes
9067138 its a real shame that i look at the photos and instead of going oh my god im naked i go oh my god i need to get to the gym
9067139 i dont even have butterflies in my stomach bring it on
9067140 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9067141 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9067142 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9067143 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9067144 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9067145 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9067146 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9067147 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9067148 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9067149 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9067150 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9067151 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9067152 its hard to stop a kid walking around and being nosy
9067153 some of these labs have highly toxic fumes and by products
9067154 there are of course specific health concerns when children have been exposed to p and it is necessary to undertake medical checks and blood toxin screening to ensure their health has not been compromised
9067155 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9067156 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9067157 mfe legal will be contacting you separately on this matter as we have concerns over the use of this consent condition
9067158 even when the council offered to pay for the tests itself mfe continued to use lawyers to try and stop them
9067159 we were always recognising that there could be people that were affected and that was what motivated our actions
9067160 the parliamentary commissioner for the environment suggested another thing we couldve done was a review of the consent but we were trying to deal with the potential issue
9067161 all we were seeking was reassurance that it wasnt a problem
9067162 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9067163 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9067164 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9067165 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9067166 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9067167 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9067168 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9067169 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9067170 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9067171 ill talk to the prime minister about this later today with the concrete evidence that she will know that these allegations are vile malevolent malicious and wrong
9067172 im going to talk to the prime minister and my full considerations will be subsequent to my talks with her
9067173 in my view hes not fit to be the foreign minister helen clark should act and she should act decisively to stand him down
9067174 it was clear to me then there were two quite different points of view at that point it becomes a matter between mr glenn and mr peters and the news media it is not a matter for me
9067175 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9067176 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9067177 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9067178 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9067179 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9067180 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9067181 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9067182 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9067183 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9067184 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9067185 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9067186 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9067187 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9067188 i know baby my mind cant even wrap around it well be okay though well be okay its going away

9067201 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9067202 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9067203 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9067204 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9067205 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9067206 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9067207 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9067208 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9067209 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9067210 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9067211 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9067212 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9067213 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9067214 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9067215 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9067216 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

9067301 en el mbito protestante los grupos no necesitan el visto bueno de un obispo o de una jerarqu a para funcionar cualquiera puede crear una iglesia y sa es precisamente nuestra debilidad no podemos evitar excesos al amparo de la libertad lo nico que podemos hacer desde ferede es explicarles cu l es la realidad espa ola y acompa arles en el proceso de constituci n los nicos l mites son la legislaci n espa ola y el evangelio

9067363 the sudden change of nationality was quite surprising i mean i have been british for 68 years and was rather annoyed to see i had been moved to the other side of the atlantic
9067364 i thought someone was having a joke i am not really happy with the way they do things at the district council this only goes to make them look silly
9067365 unfortunately the new system did not allow us to move people whose nationality was on the electoral roll with the status of unknown across to the new system with the same status of unknown
9067366 this vehicle was involved in a road traffic accident at great north road eaton socon with another vehicle then damaging the external wall of the waggon and horses

9067369 we all said throughout that building 5 000 new homes in the middle of the countryside without thinking about the consequences this would have on the area was an absolute folly and we have been proved right
9067370 lets hope this sets a precedent that no large developer will ever try to force its way into an area of our countryside again
9067371 i am not surprised by this decision but i am still relieved to hear it
9067372 there has been a massive outcry from people as they knew the traffic implications for the a10 would have been horrendous this decision is great news for cambridgeshire
9067373 we have said throughout that this town was not wanted or needed and thankfully the secretary of state has listened to our voices
9067374 it is unbelievable that the developers ever thought their plans would succeed
9067375 this town or something very similar has been on the cards since 1986 i hope this decision will finally be the end of it
9067376 this is a victory for everyone who has fought so hard to stop these plans
9067377 it would have completely destroyed the lives of the thousands of residents in east cambridgeshire
9067378 they have been here funny that isnt it when we found evidence of the break in such as a broken padlock and bricks that were removed
9067379 they must have seen it on the bbcs six oclock news
9067380 first they say they are not going to investigate and then they change their minds under pressure i feel you have to shout from the rooftops or go on tv to get cambridgeshire police to do anything
9067381 they asked my husband to investigate what if he had gone out there and got stabbed its disgraceful
9067382 this incident has been reinvestigated thoroughly and whilst it appears there is no indication of any crime having taken place we have spoken to local people and because of the nature of the area suggested they consider taking part in neighbourhood watch scheme
9067383 the arabic perspective is always give us political independence and we will take care of the rest they undermine this preparation process

9067399 champion and his driver who were wearing seat belts suffered some minor scrapes and bruises but more than anything they were in shock
9067400 i was looking down and brian the driver said look out he hit the brakes really hard you could see the front of the truck coming at the car
9067401 was scary but an amazing relief that we were both okay
9067402 if present at all the benefit was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
9067403 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
9067404 controlling for those variables reduced the relative risk of death to a statistically non significant 19 percent
9067405 over the last two decades in the united sates even while vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality
9067406 further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
9067407 its the first time in his career that hes ever gone through some tough times
9067408 the team made the playoffs so hes going to get that added piece of development all in all it was a very positive year
9067409 i felt i was the mayor there for the last two years
9067410 its the first time in his career that hes ever gone through some tough times
9067411 the team made the playoffs so hes going to get that added piece of development all in all it was a very positive year
9067412 i felt i was the mayor there for the last two years
9067413 we want to help our athletes succeed off the golf course as well as on it
9067414 americans should not worry about whether immigrants are learning english they should be sure their children are learning spanish
9067415 it the rule of law does not mean drivers licenses for illegal aliens nor does it mean that states should be allowed to flout the federal law barring them from giving in state tuition rates to illegal aliens we oppose amnesty
9067416 amnesty has to be an important part of any immigration solution because there are people who have lived in this country for 20 30 or 40 years who have raised children here and pay taxes here and are not citizens that has to be a component of it
9067417 jackson hattiesburg laurel and all areas along the coast its a little mexico
9067418 im not against people trying to make living i have a compassion for those folks but at the same time the taxpayers of mississippi shouldnt be subsidizing a plant that wont even hire their own workers
9067419 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
9067420 the union uses the tactic of saying immigration was coming and the members of the union would not be taken
9067421 i need a job and got kids i heard that they need some help now
9067422 all them mexicans got fired because they didnt have a pass all these businesses have been taking americans jobs
9067423 that doesnt justify but it certainly explains why they might be hiring individuals who show up and say ill work for you
9067424 it is disgraceful that border patrol agents are put in harms way and our government doesnt do everything reasonably within its power to protect us from marauding mexican soldiers and others
9067425 without a forceful response to these illegal incursions an agent will eventually be seriously wounded or killed it is only a matter of time
9067426 the incursions will not stop until the mexican military units and their commanders are held accountable for their actions
9067427 it is a documented fact that the mexican military is corrupt and is involved in protecting drug cartels smugglers and other criminals
9067428 there is an international boundary for a reason and they are to be respected by both governments
9067429 we take very seriously our role in working with our international neighbors to address and resolve these situations
9067430 mexican american they like there na na and their no nos and there na na na no
9067431 we are going to continue our enforcement of immigration law whether it is convenient for people or whether its not convenient
9067432 congress has mandated that we enforce these laws and that is what we intend to do
9067433 it seems to me ice used this as nothing more than a publicity ploy as a means to justify their harsh enforcement of immigration law
9067434 are likely to prevail and consequently are entitled to a preliminary injunction
9067435 what sheriff joe is doing is an abuse of power
9067436 it hurts everybody i dont like illegal immigration but there are better ways to deal with the issue
9067437 am i supposed to stop enforcing the law because of politics
9067438 i am mature i choose what i want to do and if i choose not to eat and you dont thats just fine dont worry about it
9067439 she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for
9067440 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9067441 i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy things a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built
9067442 lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9067443 at first they had me in a bunch of furs
9067444 yeah i have furs on my wall but i dont wear furs i had to show them my bunny boots and my north face clothing
9067445 a woman of faith who has a strong position on life a consistent opinion on judges
9067446 id rather go moose hunting than be involved with politics
9067447 sarah palin for her entire political career has been underestimated
9067448 shes tough shes tenacious i believe that she does have what it takes to get out there again her ability to connect with voters and make a case is very very very strong
9067449 i want to be in the shop working by 8
9067450 it still has to be that early though before people are driving past
9067451 mtahk vey the tlhinganpu during the first tune drones sounded targhmey al ruhk during last tune better jengva ngop otherwise good set qapla
9067452 the only good judge is the one that gives you first
9067453 since qwest holds a monopoly in many areas they can continue to reduce allowed bandwidth usage as they add new users while not adding new infrastructure such radical bandwidth limitation will have a chilling effect on further evolution of the internet if people cant get bandwidth then they cant use bandwidth intensive services such as youtube and netflix we may never know what the future could have been
9067454 making an online backup of your harddrive is pretty much impossible with a bandwidth cap like this so will hd streaming
9067455 but what if my child or i if youre under 24 is addicted to skateboarding due to the peer pressure he or i if youre under 24 receives at school
9067456 theyre bloogers on steroids and they act like an internet news machine
9067457 suddenly the animator suffered a fatal heart attack and alas the cartoon peril was no more
9067458 i know ill turn her into a flower shed make a lovely flower
9067459 i suddenly remembered my charlemagne let my armies be the rocks and the trees and the birds in the sky
9067460 sorry but the hands and the legs give you away
9067461 it appears our new policy is working the right way
9067462 he feels that he will be pursued by the gang members who robbed and assaulted him in the past
9067463 that is why from my perspective juveniles should be treated differently
9067464 you have a lot of situations where kids are being forced to do these things its a way to survive i dont think turning them over to ice is the answer
9067465 the haywood regional medical center board of commissioners has unanimously accepted the recommendation of the ceo search committee and has recommended that john michael poore jr be offered the position of ceo of haywood regional medical center
9067466 this is the last board meeting al will be joining us
9067467 al came initially into the ceo seat kind of by default he was going to retire in april but he recognized we had a problem and was asked to fill in during those difficult troubles he filled in and did so admirably al is to really be commended for his patience and perseverance i think hes done a great job filling in
9067468 her hands go up when she gets a strike shes so tickled
9067469 once they realize what it can do they get real excited about the variety of things they can do on the system
9067470 i talked to my daughter about it in jacksonville fla
9067471 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
9067472 they may not be getting as much support from their parents because their parents have other obligations they need to meet
9067473 the grants might not be sufficient if they have grants or loan limits might not be able to be there to pay for some of those educational costs so i think thats where some of those additional work hours are coming
9067474 as you can see there are about 20 per page and we have currently 12 pages of open positions
9067475 now i am really seeing a keener interest on the part of students in finding work
9067476 because theyre having to put together a package and they understand that student employment is one of those pieces
9067477 i dont want to go over 10 15 hours a week
9067478 just because i think that anything more than that i might be pushing it too much with all the credits i have
9067479 yah we lived right there 45 minutes from one of the largest and most famous urban parks in canada and we never went to see it
9067480 as soon as i pass carlisle i take a valium
9067481 i dont put them in the bin no i dont put them in the bin because she gets them back out again no i go down to the end of the garden and hurl them over the fence
9067482 if i ever get like that you will tell me wont you
9067483 if i get to the stage of keeping the same tea towels for 35 years even after theyve been thrown into a wood and dragged out again dont mention it and especially dont try to buy me any new ones
9067484 its fine i cant lay my hands on it just now
9067485 look at her living it up in her fine house in london while her mother has to use a teapot with no lid
9067486 look you just plug it in and it makes the tea right by the bed
9067487 why dont you want it it will make your life easier
9067488 hey why dont we get you a swing bin then the bags would fit and the stuff wouldnt go down the side and also we wouldnt have to bend
9067489 the thing is the bags you use are too small so when you put rubbish in they just slip off and sink to the bottom and the rubbish all comes out
9067490 why on earth did the carpenter leave those bloody great big gaps
9067491 well i probably wont bang an actual tray but if you two start ill just bark the word tray in your ear
9067492 ill bring the car round the side and we can push the stuff out of the window
9067493 we have been discriminated against since the beginning for the simple fact of being women and indigenous women at that
9067494 men used to mock us but we have come further than male fighters
9067495 the system was made for us to be peasants all our lives
9067496 we have more space now but it is lamentable we were kept in the darkness for so long
9067497 there is still a lot of prejudice violence and physical control over women
9067498 it will take time but cholitas know they need to fight for their rights theres a resurgence of pride in the skirt
9067499 they train alongside men and we have seen that they can do a lot
9067500 but now we are united and advancing the idea is to show that women can do this on their own
9067501 but then after she became the champion and started touring abroad i started to feel very proud
9067502 it shows that in this country we all have the same rights
9067503 the cholitas are not equal to men they shouldnt be doing this its as simple as that
9067504 people now have more energy in their later years and realise there is nothing left in their marriage once they have had their career and the children have left home
9067505 people just cant afford to get divorced at the minute
9067506 it could be that husbands will think first before heading for the divorce courts at least until the economic landscape settles particularly as the housing market has been so badly affected in the last few months couples may think twice before divorcing and buying elsewhere
9067507 the reality is that couples split up in all economic climates as we have seen throughout our 70 year history families urgently need easy access to emotional support to manage the fallout from conflict when they separate
9067508 wow were taking everything will we be back in time for me to go to big school
9067509 no as a matter of fact they did not at all they pinged around all night like bats playing with sonar and they had just the best time absolutely ever
9067510 daddy why are those naughty boys in that tent making so much din
9067511 oh daddy i wonder why people like that even come camping
9067512 we need to concentrate efforts to slash carbon emissions and become more energy efficient in order to prevent dangerous climate change but we also need to prepare for how our climate is expected to change in the future the strategy outlines in detail the range of weather conditions facing london which could both seriously threaten our quality of life particularly that of the most vulnerable people and endanger our pre eminence as one of the worlds leading cities
9067513 london is not unique all major cities such as new york and tokyo are at risk from climate change
9067514 it is essential that the capital prepares for the impacts of climate change which is already affecting londoners through increased flood risk heavier and more frequent downpours and extreme heat
9067515 the mayor must provide a comprehensive action plan for reducing emissions that includes ways to make it cheaper and easier for londoners to go green
9067516 any words of love and lust as i make my way to the office
9067517 pls spend all day thinking about when where we can meet
9067518 one day we will go to lucys for lunch then make love by the lake
9067519 we publish contributions should be 800 1 000 words long email to
9067520 i originally took six weeks off and at the end of six weeks i knew that i didnt really want to start work again this year
9067521 id always planned to leave gardeners world at the end of next year so i just thought ok ill bring it forward by a year i had become entrapped by it in a way that took me ages to realise
9067522 maybe third world countries will have to suffer as a result of our national food policy
9067523 we need to use our horticultural skills which are second to none in the world to grow food
9067524 its really important to get people aware of just how tenuous our food supply really is
9067525 for wealthy middle class people indulging in their penchant for peasant food
9067526 we dont value food in britain so therefore the cheaper it is the better it is we all eat far too much we all pay far too little for our food we have environmental problems we have health problems we have food transport problems
9067527 all one can do in the face of criticism is to say you are entitled to your view but these are things that need to be addressed the enemy or opponent we are taking on
9067528 by far the most dynamic age group growing food is the 28 to 38 year olds which is historically not a gardening age group i think that most people are aware that it takes so much oil and water to produce what theyre eating but the problem is inherent within the solution in so much as you dont want to tell people what to do but you do want to encourage enthuse and inform them
9067529 yes its on the cards due to being ill i put a stop to all work and officially i havent committed myself to anything but the danger is that by being on television you become part of the institution i like the idea of fifth columnists and subversion you dont stand on a podium with a loud hailer telling people what to do which the british absolutely hate youve got to somehow get under the skin of the system and make lots and lots of small changes
9067530 this terrifying disastrous evil has actually usurped and upset the whole system it makes you ask what were they doing right well they just bypassed they stepped aside theyre just not there you need to join together not delegate to a government body
9067531 my experience of working with government has not been fruitful i have to say im not aligned to any party although like many people i feel very disillusioned by the current government but dont feel very hopeful over any alternative power is not the right bit of kit to do this job its about going after the hearts and minds yes there will always be why should this wealthy tv wanker tell me what to do and its not a bad question why should i but i think youve just got to allow people to reject what you say
9067532 its an albatross organic is loaded with a sense of rightness with a set of rules i would much rather someone bought food that was local and sustainable but not organic than bought organic food that had to be shipped across the world weve got to move away from making people feel lesser because theyre not eating organic there is no doubt about it sustainable is a better expression for the same sorts of ideas than organic
9067533 you cant just say its bad because its bad plant breeding has been going on for millennia and its a gradual process at the moment i feel not nearly enough research is being done on the effects of gm and i have no faith at all in the goodwill of the producers and their motives but my overall feeling is that i would not discount anything
9067534 i do feel optimistic but i also feel that im 53 both my parents died in their sixties and youve got to leave this world in a better place that you find it youve got take the fuckers on and not just give in
9067535 for wealthy middle class people indulging in their penchant for peasant food
9067536 organic is loaded with a sense of rightness with a set of rules weve got to move away from making people feel lesser because theyre not eating organic
9067537 there is no doubt about it that sustainable is a better expression for the same sorts of ideas than organic
9067538 john mccain says he will follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he cannot find him in the cave he is hiding in
9067539 change does not come from washington it comes to washington
9067540 its not that john mccain doesnt know he doesn get it
9067541 we do not need the next four yrs to be the last 8 yrs
9067542 i think its about time we voted for senators with breasts after all weve been voting for boobs long enough
9067543 there would be a heightened risk of serious public disorder
9067544 tokyo youth mokoto konno prefers to play baseball by the boys than tattle through the other girls stuck at a midpoint betwixt baby and grown up and with graduation approaching shes not in addition sure of that which shed in the manner of to do by the rest of her life that is to the time when a unintelligible casualty in the science lab gives mokoto the sufficiency to leap literally back in time once she recognizes the life changing potential of her newfound power mokotos existence becomes increasingly utterly confused in a line of breathtaking freeze frame sequences she plunges into the past in every attempt to work doom in her favor to this time it soon becomes disagreeably clear that she cannot avert the necessary more than virtuous a visually stunning anime adventure the girl who leapt through time is a metaphorical tale of teenage angst mokotos manic time leaping reflects her deeper awe of growing up a contradiction of creeping adulthood of miserable romantic feelings incertitude about her coming time and a growing nostalgia for her simple aloft reprove life circumscribed by the baseball diamond and her two best friends

9067546 the fall in congestion is good news in an otherwise bleak picture for uk motorists and shows that drivers are moving journeys out of peak hours where possible
9067547 we are replacing a ford focus that we use for only a few thousand miles a year when we want a bit more comfort on longer trips or holiday
9067548 we have seen a three year old toyota avensis which seems a nice car for our purpose but are put off by the automation associated with headlights wipers door locks etc can you recommend a comfortable car in this class that is prepared to let us think for ourselves
9067549 we dont want to go particularly fast but want to be comfortable on journeys of 100 miles plus we need power steering and air conditioning and favour a petrol model

9067562 it is very encouraging to see the work bt are putting into mobile working remote employment is becoming the preferred method of working in the uk driven by large organisations such as bt who clearly see the two way benefits of this working practise
9067563 mobile working can liberate people by giving them more flexibility over their time and more control over their jobs both are important in helping to make modern life less stressful as with any technology people can experience problems with mobile devices if they dont take note of simple practical steps such as those developed by bt business before they begin to use their equipment
9067564 mobile and flexible working has transformed both business and personal lives by observing a few general principles workers can ensure they see all the benefits of mobile working without any downside businesses need to be aware of their legal responsibility for the health and safety of employees wherever they are working

9067568 i dont think its a short resume she first ran for office back in 1992 i dont know what senator obama was doing then but the first time she ran was 1992 thats 16 years i think thats a pretty pretty event filled and record filled resume
9067569 one small step for man one giant leap for mankind
9067570 all i know is what little i read on the internet
9067571 appears to be more than enough to saturate all the ars in the body
9067572 this is an important and positive step forward in our reorganization process
9067573 we now have the space at dia that fits our operational needs while meeting the financial needs of our business plan going forward we are also sending an important message that we are committed to dia the state of colorado and all of our loyal passengers for the long term

9067575 an exemplary life up until the time of the offenses and even after
9067576 judges dont like to be accused of making a mistake
9067577 there are some very basic rights that clearly have to be applied
9067578 the governor is the only person that has the authority to remove him from office she should have thought of this before she embroiled herself
9067579 the issue was is there middle ground that both parties could live with to serve the interests of justice clearly there wasnt
9067580 as for that vp talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration
9067581 governor palin is a vice presidential selection which shows that john mccain at the age of 72 today is still able to think outside the box governor palin will delight the republican base she is pro life it appears that senator obama played it safe in picking senator biden and senator mccain made the bold and unconventional choice in picking governor palin
9067582 senator mccain made an outstanding pick from the choices that were on the table sarah palin clearly addresses the issues so many conservatives are concerned about it balances out the ticket shes also really a checkmate for the democratic party because folks who were looking to make history for barack obama can make history by voting for john mccain in seeing the first woman elected to the vice presidency it was a very strategic move by john mccain
9067583 el objetivo es desterrar las bolsas pl sticas y trasladarnos nuevamente al g nero y al papel que es realmente lo m s amigable con nuestro ecosistema

9067596 the hubbard act honors the sacrifice of brave americans who have served their country honorably in the face of tremendous personal tragedy
9067597 im pleased that the president has signed it into law putting an end to a policy that was unfair and deeply flawed finally americas sole survivors will get the benefits they deserve
9067598 our military men and women and their families have made sacrifices on behalf of our freedom and democracy
9067599 when these families experience tragedy and loss their situation should not be made more difficult as a result of poorly constructed policies and procedures im pleased the president has signed the hubbard act into law which will ensure sole survivors are not penalized when they separate from the military and that the benefits and pay to which they are entitled are consistent with personnel who are involuntarily separated under honorable conditions
9067600 today is a great day for all of the sole survivors in our nation as this bill rights a wrong for our brave men and women in uniform
9067601 i am also pleased that president bush signed this bill into law with jason hubbards family in attendance
9067602 may not pass the required 5 falls and may pose a serious risk over time

9067606 the various stages of exhumation inspection and reburial will be spread over several days and we anticipate that this will take place in the autumn of this year once all is ready here in the church
9067607 part of the established procedure prior to a beatification requires that if the body of the new beatus exists then it must be exhumed inspected and transferred to a place of honor befitting the persons new status
9067608 as a great man of the church and devoted to the saints himself cardinal newman would have been the first to insist on obeying a request of the holy see and the last to insist that his own personal wishes be regarded as immutable hence it is that his body will not be returned to the grave at rednal but brought here into the oratory church and placed in a specially constructed sarcophagus
9067609 it should be noted that at the specific request of the congregation for saints causes the exhumation will be an entirely private event but that the re interment in our church will be a public ceremony
9067610 if the theologians vote in favor the cardinals of the congregation for saints causes will meet to give their approval
9067611 then the matter will be put before pope benedict xvi who alone can issue the decree of beatification which will probably occur sometime in december
9067612 it is likely that the actual beatification ceremony would be held in rome during the spring or early summer of 2009

9067620 recent economic data points towards a weakening of real gdp growth in the eurozone economy and a more accommodative monetary policy could be needed to prevent the region from falling into a recession
9067621 this supports our view that the ecb will eventually cut rates pretty aggressively although worries over the inflation outlook will keep the bank on hold for some months yet
9067622 the inflation figure caused some yen buying since it was quite high the markets reacted naturally
9067623 the imagery and the message behind obamas speech was more powerful than any that i have ever seen in my lifetime
9067624 its really refreshing to actually be able to witness history unfolding like this
9067625 it was a complete inspiration i have high hopes for our next president
9067626 i cried my eyelashes off i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
9067627 hes not an african american candidate hes a candidate for americans
9067628 its strange to get the feeling that you will remember the exact moment and place you were sitting when someone gives a speech
9067629 its an incredible time to be around i wish my momma could have seen this day
9067630 theres the chills you get from hearing an incredible melody in a song from seeing the best movie youve ever seen in your life but this was something different i dont want to this to sound like a joke but obama has coin face his face will look amazing on a silver dollar and i want to be spending that silver dollar
9067631 he talks about hope but he actually delivers he has supports facts figures and the ba s to say it all at the risk of his political standing
9067632 his speeches convince me that he is an honest politician possibly the first in a desperately long time

9067636 islam in its present form either perceived or real is incompatible with the norms of modern society there are many outdated traditions and practices that are inhumane or plain barbaric unfortunately islamic fundamentalists use those traditions to wage war with the non islamic world we believe that if we purify islam form its medieval practices and remove the theological basis of modern terrorism the clash of civilizations will be averted and islam could become a part of the free and democratic world

9067639 because what the court is holding is that the company was permeated with fraud and therefore everything is taken rather than a defined amount of what was fraud
9067640 steven warshak preyed on perceived sexual inadequacies of customers not only was steven warshak corrupt but he corrupted his family he was the mastermind of the debacle but for his arrogance he could have helped them all by taking responsibility but he was blinded by his arrogance and greed
9067641 he said it was extremely unlikely someone would get anything notarized saying they had a small penis
9067642 under advertising law you are responsible not only for your direct message but you are also responsible for implied statements
9067643 so that advertising maybe a five year old wouldnt get it but when you and i see it it doesnt matter that theyre not talking about the girth from whats actually in the ads theres enough recognition in the public of what theyre implying so while theyre not using the exact words the message of that advertisement is very clear and that is a violation of federal trade commission law
9067644 normal process is if the agency catches wind of something that they are not happy with you will get a warning letter
9067645 most companies following the receipt of a warning letter will change their labeling sufficiently so that they are not running afoul of the fdas rules what makes this case particularly interesting is that there are lots of dietary supplement companies out on the market making claims that they shouldnt be and its very rare that something like this happens usually the worst thing that youll see is the ftc will go after you for false advertising and disgorge some of your profits
9067646 and if there was a taking of their profits sometimes if it was a small operation that takes in a couple of million depending on the facts of the case they might get that couple of million getting 500 million if thats what they made thats a really significant verdict
9067647 there have been some recent cases which require more than just that
9067648 you need to have stealth you need to have issues of camouflage for money laundering which my client didnt do you dont hide money in your own name i think there are issues on the principles of money laundering theres issues of bank fraud when no bank suffered any losses so there are major issues for appeal
9067649 proportionality is always an issue to be raised on appeal proportionality with other case and proportionality within the same case
9067650 the judge even stated on the record that no one lost their homes or life savings that was part of his remarks so the prison time and the forfeiture definitely seem out of proportion
9067651 its going to be a fantastic route for the runners
9067652 we thought the royal parks foundation should do something with these wonderful open spaces
9067653 we stage races such as the nike 10k but we didnt have our own event there wasnt a half marathon
9067654 i have done this for years but its only recently i discovered that what i thought was my personal oddity has a proper title
9067655 i suffer from stress induced clinical depression and i think my night eating is symptomatic of my mental state the more stress there is in my life the more often i wake up im supposed to be losing weight so raiding the carbs in the middle of the night doesnt do much for my self esteem
9067656 people affected crave sugary and starchy food which can have a soothing effect we dont call these types of food comfort food for nothing explains susan ringwood beats chief executive
9067657 night eating syndrome often emerges at times of emotional stress it becomes a way of coping a form of self medication but in the long term it may add to this distress with feelings of guilt and shame at uncontrollable eating urges related weight gain may in turn make sufferers feel shameful and uncomfortable
9067658 it often occurs in stressed career women i remember one successful executive who was very controlling about her daytime eating but went to sleep with a bowl of sweets next to her bed for dipping into during the night

9067663 ironically according to saray lskow at the center for public integrity who analyzed palins disclosure forms sarah palins financial portfolio is managed by none other than soloman smith barney
9067664 furthermore by joining mccain on the tdicket palin is now endorsing a radical 300 billion in tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy that would leave out mllions of american families while delivering 45 billion in tax breaks for americas 200 largest corporations and at leasdt 6 3 billion for americans largest financial firms

9067672 i want to be sheriff to address community relations issues and also the more important police issues such as fighting drugs
9067673 as i do my door to doors talking to people throughout the community that is absolutely the number one concern and i have some ideas on how to additional attack that as a sheriff
9067674 it isnt the fault of the sheriff its the fault of low pay fault of mandated shifts scheduling
9067675 think it has a huge effect particularly because im fighting for very similar things as barack obama is he talked about a lot of the things last night that i just mentioned now

9067694 it would obviously be an honour for me to serve the country and for alaskas sake too it would be very good for our future for an alaskan to be serving nationally

9067706 the buddhist monastery the traditional centre of moral authority in most villages here proved to be the one institution that people could rely on for help monasteries in the delta those still standing after the storm were clogged with refugees people went there with donations or as volunteers monasteries that served as religious centres orphanages and homes for the elderly are now also shelters for the homeless
9067707 trucks of rice beans onions clothes tarpaulins and cooking utensils donated from all over burma
9067708 each day shortly after dawn a convoy of trucks or a barge on the rangoon river departs for the delta loaded with relief supplies and volunteers
9067709 the monks have played a very significant role beginning with the opening up of the temples in the delta to offer refuge for the victims this has certainly brought the monks and people closer the monks have won the hearts of the people
9067710 to play a physically violent role would be far from our beliefs
9067711 i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
9067712 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against and the taliban in afghanistan

9067718 when i told people i wanted to be a priest they were shocked and disbelieving some of them thought i should be committed
9067719 now if a youth says he wants to be a priest there is huge discouragement it is seen as a very silly career move
9067720 i was ordained 22 years ago and when i was in the seminary there were a hundred of us just for the dublin diocese
9067721 a woman in the sacristy at a wedding on saturday looked at me and said are you the parish priest
9067722 and its not going to get any easier morale can be low at times you are just working so hard and theres nobody coming behind you
9067723 we have had no candidates for the priesthood for 12 years maybe 15 no intake in that length of time
9067724 way back we had so many priests they were sent on loan to glasgow or england or america
9067725 its the secularisation of ireland the reduction in family size ireland has just caught up with the more secular europe with its more libertarian values good values around freedom and individuality and personal choice
9067726 it really bolsters you buoys you up to see that
9067727 but theres absolutely no need to be they can see it as a sort of competition theyre afraid that if they give people more power theyre going to lose power
9067728 but it isnt like that its a collaborative effort a sharing of responsibility it takes a lot of weight off the priest
9067729 for us to be able to survive we must share the workload said fr mullan
9067730 its quite threatening to the professional identity of the priest when non ordained people come into work in the parish theyre to be paid more than the clergy and perhaps in time their status will be equal to or greater than the clergy
9067731 its up to us to reorganise things and adapt to the change
9067732 we have to recognise whatever god is saying to us about combining the roles of the clergy and the laity
9067733 when you get to know her you are going to be as impressed as i am
9067734 i know it will demand the best that i have to give
9067735 thats diversity right there isnt it wow and who do the republicans have good old rich white boys i think thats another factor that has to be considered by republicans that in some way their candidates are a reflection of more politics as usual not to slam good old rich boys but it sure wouldnt hurt for new energy and new perspective to be enveloped by the republican party
9067736 someone who has fought against corruption polices and failed policies of the past someone with experience who has shown great tenacity and skill in tackling tough problems she has strong principles a fighting sprit and deep compassion
9067737 what im hearing from senator obama is a lot like what we heard from robert kennedy no matter what campaign ad we see or how its spun hope is important its what this country was based on
9067738 its the first time in his career that hes ever gone through some tough times

9067745 one skilled in the science of joining together in an orderly fashion the knowledge of one field of learning with that of other fields
9067746 although i have read the ny times almost daily since junior high school it wasnt until my politics matured that i realized its function as the establishments official line of right thinking
9067747 until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration we want to make sure that that vp slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up here
9067748 and when a story gets to you that gives you the energy to meet the challenges of turning it into a film it wasnt easy the fact that we started in 2001 and completed the film in 2007 gives you an idea of the problems we faced
9067749 his advice to me while i was making the film was to be careful because it was a difficult film he liked it a lot he said but it was very difficult
9067750 because oukili himself came not from the sewers but from a similar background it was a dream he realised through love and respect respect was one of the things he taught them but also perhaps learned from them because remember he himself was only 20 when he arrived only a little older than the children they grew up together
9067751 one which belongs to the distant past the fact that people are talking about such things again is a dangerous sign for europe

9067973 it is difficult to put a time scale on clearing the backlog because they fluctuate constantly and once neonatal clinics start in the autumn it will mean that no more newborns will be added to waiting lists
9067974 additional clinics have been put in place to address the lists and these clinics will increase once additional staff have been recruited

9067980 it is also obvious that the wartime leader of bosnian serbs the same as milosevic will base his defence on ideological and political grounds rather than on legal grounds
9067981 breaking off diplomatic relations with tbilisi is not moscows choice and the responsibility lies with tbilisi
9067982 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
9067983 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory

9067986 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9067987 there is only one candidate who has truly fought for america and that man is john mccain
9067988 but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9067989 as a small open economy that relies heavily on exports and foreign investment from american multinationals it could be disastrous if obama adopts more protectionist policies however mccains tax cuts add to the dilemma
9067990 when you consider that the current us rate is 35 its not surprising that ireland has held such appeal
9067991 we have one of the highest minimum wages in europe high transport costs and social partnership agreements look increasingly under threat if mccain lowers the corporation tax rate the current recession could be amplified by a more pronounced fall in investment
9067992 we are not worried about the comments at this point theres some level of political rhetoric here but we will watch this policy area closely should he become president

9067995 ryanair promised to reduce aer linguss fares scrap aer linguss fuel surcharges and reduce aer linguss costs in order to secure the future of aer lingus
9067996 aer lingus is being marginalised on the sidelines of european aviation losing money with no apparent strategy

9068006 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 chance on change
9068007 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meagre record of senator obama

9068014 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
9068015 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
9068016 so if he were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what
9068017 he expects presumptive democratic nominee barack obama to choose a running mate based on political calculations not the persons readiness for the job
9068018 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice rove said
9068019 but as long as im around youre second best you might as well learn to live with it
9068020 permission was not sought or granted nor would it have been given
9068021 folks look given this pick and all i have learned about what would happen with a democratic victory we have no choice but to enthusiastically work for the mccain palin ticket
9068022 this is a great win for our program to open the season and a testament to how much weve grown over the spring and in brazil

9068024 arizona voters will have a chance to vote on this important issue

9068058 googles a great company got some great products but you know in some respects i think google is where microsoft was 7 or 10 years ago
9068059 microsoft has over 40 full time people invested in privacy and over 400 part time people google hasnt at least from what i read about them evolved to that
9068060 we think about privacy as part of the core design we have thought about how to design privacy into the product as opposed to how to react to the negative impressions
9068061 so these are all images that anyone could go out and take with a camera we do take great care that if someone did feel their privacy was invaded there is a way that they can easily tell us about it and well remove it right away
9068062 the thing is any time you get a provider in the market that has a predominantly large share of that market questions start to get asked about their practices about what their motives are
9068063 i desperately hope that they in fact i expect that they will change they will become as grown up as some of the larger companies around so in some respects its a predictable thing
9068064 well you can do that but if you do this and this youll get this positive result
9068065 do i have a good relationship with him oneill i dont think so
9068066 if i have to say hello then i will say hello to him i dont have any problem
9068067 i had a good relationship with martin oneill before this summer and i was surprised at what has been said
9068068 i dont know what the reaction will be from the villa fans but we were correct in what we did with the transfer
9068069 the agent was clear the player will stay there and for me thats it end of story
9068070 we know that barry is a good player very good for them we will try to contain him on the pitch and not talk too much about other things that have happened in the summer it is important that we all concentrate on football but i expect barry to do his best for his team
9068071 im not every single day phoning up managers to ask how they are nor do i expect them to call me
9068072 im sure shaking hands will not be a problem let me be clear on this i have not a major problem at all because it happens in the game
9068073 he called me and we spoke about steves operation and how long it would be everything was really positive
9068074 we needed to decide what was best for the player the club and for england
9068075 if wed delayed it then he might have been out for even longer you cant keep an injured player playing games we needed to do the operation now steven couldnt play and was struggling with the problem he had and was always in pain
9068076 i enjoyed every minute at newcastle and working with the manager
9068077 but the way things were going i knew offers had come in over the summer and the club had turned them down their valuation of me wasnt reflected in the deal i was on speaking to newcastle i thought it was the right thing to do to put in a transfer request to show how i felt seeing they werent on the same wavelength as me they then made the decision to sell me
9068078 james has got a fantastic move and we have got some more money in the pot should we choose to use it in this window or the next i did want to keep james but there comes a point when a deal is right to do im convinced that despite the fact that it wont look a positive move to our fans at the moment i think what will happen over the next two or three days will be positive for the future of this club
9068079 the chairman said i have earned the right to spend money
9068080 i am not a kid in a sweet shop but this is an opportunity for us james has got a great spirit about him and i definitely think his best years are in front of him it was disappointing two years ago not to sign him when we thought the deal was done and dusted but it is nice to have got it all sorted this time
9068081 the top four is tough to get into but a club will get in there at some point and aston villa are in as good as position as any
9068082 i am quite disappointed that my time with manchester united has finished like this with so many injury problems
9068083 but i am very happy that a club of evertons stature have shown they are interested in me its a club that is involved in european football and i was very impressed when i spoke to their manager david moyes he told me exactly how he wanted me to play he was very honest with me i also spoke to sir alex ferguson and his opinion was that it would be good for me to sign for everton because i would get the chance to play more there
9068084 louis is a good centre forward who has a bit of everything
9068085 he can run head the ball and score goals and he hasnt cost us any money if i can get him out there 20 times a season that would give us a chance of winning 20 games he picked up a calf strain in training at united but it isnt far away from being ok now
9068086 if it was me and i was in the same situation i would be working for the club as hard as i could until told otherwise
9068087 if i didnt want to be somewhere id still give my all every training session every game some players will work in these situations and others wont its a dream for him to play for them the only thing is the way you go about doing the transfer
9068088 it doesnt give out a great message and hasnt exactly boosted the reputation of professional footballers in this country from the supporters point of view
9068089 he is coming back a better player older wiser and with more experience of top level games what hes got now is the opportunity to play week in week out which wasnt afforded him at his previous club he will benefit and in the end possibly england will benefit because we want him back playing international football on a regular basis
9068090 i always gave it my best whenever i had the chance it was just that i had limited chances i couldnt stop smiling all the way up here and to top it off my kids are happy to be back as well so that makes my day for me
9068091 i feel i will definitely benefit from my time at chelsea it was a tough time but there were a lot of players there for me to learn from im just looking forward to getting out there getting dirty and working hard obviously england is a huge factor in me coming here but my main aim is to get back playing football with city do the best i can and get a run of games
9068092 the offer is impossible to reject and not just because of the money the premier league is a paradise for players and that is why i want to play here juventus also wanted me but i wanted to come to england and to manchester
9068093 in beijing the manchester city scouts watched the argentina matches and decided to do the deal i hope to fulfill all their expectations and im looking forward to playing in the uefa cup its a great competition
9068094 to make the world safe for free trade and slave labor
9068095 lets have a look at what you could have won
9068096 if you lose your best player it will make the squad look even though we are not pretty average without gareth if im honest
9068097 for him to stay has given us a massive boost even if it is just for the rest of this season having gareth for another year is going to hopefully help this club push on to the next level
9068098 i am contracted to villa they set a fee and it wasnt matched rules are rules
9068099 i spoke to the manager and ive no problem giving 100 for aston villa and that will be starting against liverpool it was a long summer there was continuous speculation but i feel i am strong mentally and ill be fine with it now
9068100 its been going on for so long and its something that we learned to cope with
9068101 it hasnt been to anyones advantage i am relieved he is still here because i was expecting liverpool to come in and complete the deal
9068102 it wasnt the ideal pre season for me so i guess the games are always the best thing
9068103 if he was on the verge of going to liverpool and they didnt want to stump up the money for him im sure he would like to prove what theyre missing liverpool chose to spend their money elsewhere and their loss is our gain
9068104 theres a good chance of getting three or four in
9068105 no i wouldnt say there wont be any more outgoings
9068106 i dont think any player is untouchable that is not to say in any way shape or form that we want to see owen leave i certainly would not support that but im afraid a club and a manager not wanting a player to go is sometimes not enough
9068107 there is no player who can say no to barcelona
9068108 emmanuels transfer saga and the fact he was wanted by all the clubs in europe was not down to him it was down to his performances
9068109 in the end he has chosen to stay why should that on top of everything turn against him that is very hard for him to take
9068110 we have to be realistic that he is wanted by leading clubs is an honour for arsenal that he has decided to stay is as well an honour and the fact that he made financial sacrifices is as well an honour for the club on top of that we turn against him
9068111 we have a story here that has been manipulated against him but just look at the facts i have experience with many players and i can tell you that face to face i have seen him many times and he always said that he wanted to stay of course if you can earn 10 here and 130 there you are ready to stay for 60 but not for 10
9068112 i like it when a player is not pr savvy because when they become pr they always have the right behaviour outside and the wrong inside
9068113 i prefer the reverse situation a guy who makes a few mistakes when you know about pr you are always in the shit as a manager they always have a series of things that people want to hear and they never behave as they talk
9068114 i can give you plenty of examples but in adebayors case he maybe made pr mistakes but on what is really important the way he trained the way he worked the way he behaved on a daily basis he was a credit we have to be intelligent enough inside and the fans as well to support him he needs the fans to be behind him he is always under pressure to score goals but we want him to feel relaxed and play football like he loves to
9068115 you prefer to play at home after a champions league away tie the way we handle those fixtures can make or break our premier league season there will be some long difficult trips but we want to cope with it and of course come out of it it gives you an edge in the premier league if you qualify early then you are not under stress to give absolutely everything in one important game later in the group
9068116 its a tough tie there is no question about that
9068117 we will have to do very well if we are going to go through but if we show the form that we showed last year we would be more than comfortable with whoever we play
9068118 i saw li ge against liverpool in midweek and they did very well at anfield so we know that we face two tough games but its great that we are in the uefa cup its a terrific challenge for us but we are looking forward to it
9068119 it is not an easy draw they are a good side
9068120 the portuguese league is a tough one with teams like fc porto sporting lisbon and benfica but guimaraes finished third last season so they cant be bad
9068121 it is a big thing for this club to be in europe and we are looking forward to it but weve got several important premier league games before that and well focus on those first
9068122 we hope on tuesday morning when we wake up he will still be a spurs player
9068123 its difficult i dont really want to comment on speculation that has been going on but we just hope he is going to stay
9068124 i think it is going to be difficult because they are top of their league
9068125 they beat barcelona the other night so we will have to do very well at home to start with but i am not too concerned about the tie as we have a lot of quality players in our squad
9068126 it is a good draw and hopefully we can do the job in the first leg
9068127 we are just glad to be playing in europe again it is fantastic for the club and fantastic for the fans
9068128 we played a very good side in denmark and did well to come through that tie we want a winning culture so all competitions are important
9068129 well go there and treat them with respect well do our homework and hopefully our form will be good going into the tie
9068130 weve got to get used to playing two games in a week and thats why it was important for the manager to add to the squad this summer hopefully he can add more
9068131 its a difficult draw as any seeded team is going to be a good side but the fact that were away from home first is really important
9068132 we have to be prepared to win 1 0 over the two legs which isnt the way we normally play but you have to be very strict and disciplined in your defending and you have to take your chances i think that if we play the way we did against dundee united last saturday then we will beat nancy
9068133 simple things really that were on his mind how to prepare for games the sacrifices to make the effort that needs to be put in its not easy for kids that age and i feel for them because deep down they know they might never make it ive got loads of mates who were brilliant talented footballers growing up but who never made it and are out of the game now so for me its great if i can pass on any advice i want to be the kind of footballer who is willing to help out the young lads even if it is only in a small way
9068134 robbies transfer was a sensitive issue and nobody in the dressing room really knew what was going on until it had actually gone through then the manager pulled me over he said he needed a new vice captain and i had the experience that i was old enough to take the extra responsibility and it was there if i wanted it i had no inkling whatsoever that it was coming
9068135 but its important that we trust the club weve already spent a lot of money on people like david bentley and luka modric and i have confidence that the club wont be standing still ok to see someone like robbie leave is tough he was a great player for us hes a great lad well miss him and we wish him well berba is another brilliant player although for now he is still a spurs player but no player is irreplaceable and maybe it can be darren bents season as well i cant give darren enough credit for his attitude even last season when he was sat on the bench he was patient he never moaned and he trained hard every single day he was on the bench in the carling cup final but when that whistle went he was out on the pitch celebrating with everybody else
9068136 im convinced that once we get some momentum going the sky is the limit
9068137 weve still got a top squad with an abundance of good players martin did a fantastic job we finished fifth twice and he was a top manager for us but juande has the experience of winning things theres an aura about him when he comes into a room people stand up and take notice hes been successful hes won trophies and you cant help but listen to someone like that thats the difference were led now by someone who has been there and done it and thats what i am sure will happen if we are patient he ramos is trying to turn us from being a nearly team a semi final team a fifth placed team into a side that can actually win things
9068138 im only 24 which is still young but i dont think of myself as one of the young lads anymore i suppose thats how people have always seen me but there comes a time when you have to take extra responsibility im definitely coming out of that young lads thing now im in that middle bracket now
9068139 juande coming here has been a good thing for me
9068140 when a new manager comes in you are naturally wary and it does cross your mind that you might not figure in his plans its a new regime and were working a lot harder physically theres a lot more running and a lot more weights he put that on us straight away if you want to get involved then do if not then you can go somewhere else i just got my head down and worked hard to impress him i think he could see what i was doing and appreciated it and my performances have just got better and better
9068141 id been involved in a lot of squads but under steve mcclaren i never seemed to get a sniff
9068142 we showed what we can do when we won the carling cup last season
9068143 we beat chelsea in the final and to get there we beat arsenal and also manchester city away so i know what this team can do but its no good sitting here in august talking about it we have to prove it
9068144 we can only thank kenny for what he did here
9068145 he was a good pro he helped us to win two trophies and he didnt cause a minutes problem kenny only moved on because i couldnt guarantee him a game i appreciate and understand that he has my admiration and respect because he just wanted to play football i didnt want him to leave not at all
9068146 to be fair we have tried to contact the poland manager leo beenhakker but his mobile just keeps ringing out
9068147 but hes made his decision and well have to stand by that ive spoken to artur and hes given us his version and thats it closed now artur has cost himself two polish caps but id still like to get in touch with mr beenhakker ive tried my best
9068148 artur played well for us last week his attitude has been first class
9068149 a lot of you boys like to take cocaine because it makes you feel jolly
9068150 did you think id leave you lying when theres room on my horse for two
9068151 i wanted lampard its not a mystery but i could not be happier with muntari who has made me absolutely forget lampard
9068152 he is the most complete coach i have ever had on the field and off it you immediately see the difference with other coaches
9068153 i dont know our rivals sufficiently to say what our chances are but the champions league is a rather difficult competition
9068154 mourinho is an expert and the players have gained experience this could be our year
9068155 when this team has had time to work together we will win games 2 0 and 3 0 not 1 0
9068156 i have only worked with the team for one month so we will get much better
9068157 roma are very strong and have experience and you need to put them at the top of the list of contenders because they also have an excellent coach
9068158 milan despite the poor pre season results have tradition on their side and the return of ronaldinho should be kept in consideration juventus always have character and fiorentina could be the outsiders
9068159 it is important that the allocation be divided equally between the two cities
9068160 ngos used to be given some allocations but it was often difficult to get hold of the money
9068161 it is as if he read the script he was given and that was a mistake he can change his attitude hes recoverable
9068162 hes an important player with quality velocity many good things but i have very very good players here already
9068163 we had a good offer for him and it was important for the club and important for him
9068164 they were still sad and angry because one defensive mistake cost them
9068165 the long ball struck the chelsea defender ricardo carvalho on the back then robbie keane hit a banana shot a fantastic shot they remember that but ive tried to change their mentality what happened then is not important now we are in a good situation tottenham are in a bad situation my players understand
9068166 it is a budget geared towards improving the peoples welfare
9068167 we are still short of about 5 000 rooms and the tax breaks will encourage more investment here particularly in the hotel line
9068168 i find it disturbing that the prime minister datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi had forgotten to address inflation the budget did not forecast the inflation rate for 2009
9068169 the auteur school of game development is not only outmoded but dangerous to the vitality of the medium
9068170 in the printed edition of vegas magazine brittany also talks about her new movie black water transit where she claims she wears nothing the entire time and has sex with everyone
9068171 hey i can still get down and throw down and im not about to retire
9068172 about five minutes into the show he whispered in my ear this would be great in las vegas he liked the show he laughed and he sang along and he enjoyed it and at the end he said it reminded him very much of the 60s when he went into broadway and he had gone to see nichols and may those are my two collective heroes and the reason i went into python this musical is of course lovingly ripped off from the movie monty python and the holy grail which was made in 1975 for about 400 000 on the musical that is less than the lawyers cost but to come to the stage it needed quite a bit of changing we did about 17 drafts over 4 years but it made its money back after six months on broadway it was the big winner in london and we have a touring company that is really doing well everywhere
9068173 i thought it was an extraordinary show and i thought it was so funny i had not laughed as hard at a broadway musical since the first time i saw noises off back in the 80s i described spamalot as the show that if you laugh too long you miss the next joke it just doesnt stop and that is why i wanted to do it i wasnt thinking about vegas and lo and behold they said we are opening up in vegas and they asked if i would be in it i thought what a dream when my wife and i were in new york i went to see every other show because i really wanted to see what else was out there i circled two roles and i said to my wife i have got to do these roles one was the lead in dirty rotten scoundrels which closed before i got a hold of it and the other was the king in spamalot so it is easy to hop over to the executive airport and go home in la in just 45 minutes this has been an extraordinary thing and ill be full time through the summer here in vegas but then i go back in september and film we are shooting family feud again ill also be doing a new nbc show and believe it or not theres even a new one too but i cant talk about that one yet so in some cases i will be leaving vegas at midnight flying back to shoot the next day and then flying back here to do the spamalot show again that same night these are the gravy years this is the time you do the things to give you greater freedom later in life so while the opportunities are there i am going to embrace them
9068174 much has been written that maybe las vegas is not the place for comedy and musical theater the people come here from the midwest and around the world and they want spectacle they want big exciting things and maybe the musical theater isnt right for vegas over a period of years we have learned from the press and so we said why not face the inevitable and lets end it so we looked for the perfect piece of material to put a final chapter of theater into las vegas
9068175 there is a reality to these hotels in vegas there is a certain amount of space and there are certain things you can do we said well if we could do spamalot in the grail theater where avenue q was we would be able to preserve our convention and meeting space instead of building a third theater i must confess that i am ashamed of myself that i did it because of the money and the planning the decision was taken to abbreviate the stay of q we wanted to bring to this city something that hasnt really been done before we believe that vegas is a rich and mature enough community to also exploit wit and this theater was built to be that place in this city where humor and wit prevail i said to eric the night i went to spamalot for the first time this is the easiest entertainment decision i have made in 40 years las vegas would understand it and they would love it we are committed to the show for as long as the public likes it
9068176 only a couple of songs went all for one which we needed because we had a costume change for all the girls to get ready for the spamalot number
9068177 i was very nervous about opening in london i wasnt sure which way they would jump
9068178 i dont think we have added more vegas elements to it just because we are in vegas i realized that we couldnt improve or change the show because its so big and gross and over the top already we can only stay true to what we already do well that is part of the charm of it i am sure our vegas audiences will laugh like theyve never laughed before i find for me that it is more fun to work on python that anything else i tried to do a live reunion here in 1988 and we got very close we got an offer dates a hotel and then michael palin at the last minute said no he didnt want to do it it is scary to go back into the world of silliness but its essential to keep challenging yourself now though i dont think it will ever happen and thats why spamalot is so alive and well and keeping python alive and well too
9068179 the material is wacky and absurd irreverent and politically incorrect which is how you would describe las vegas actually
9068180 some of tylers other hits include total eclipse of the heart

9068416 in essence all obama wants from the bush regime is that it fess up to having launched the war based on false information and to henceforth come clean with the senate on how it plans to proceed in the future those democrats who want to dwell on the past the actual genesis and rationale for the war and the real reasons for its continuation should be quiet obama and many of his colleagues are more interested in consulting the bush men on the best way to win the war than in effecting an american withdrawal at any foreseeable time

9068422 interested in fighting only for those changes that fit within the existing boundaries of whats considered mainstream in washington instead of using his platform to redefine those boundaries this posture
9068423 comes even as polls consistently show that washingtons definition of mainstream is divorced from the rest of the countrys for example politicians refusal to debate the war even as polls show that americans want the troops home

9068434 the single biggest driver of our toxic political environment and thus the single biggest obstacle to the recovery of wisconsins economy
9068435 i think of it as a clean slate and i think that the city of madison the state of wisconsin are accustomed to vigorous political debate and differences of opinion and i see no reason why this will have dug a hole for anyone
9068436 in order to make up the difference we must achieve a citywide water use reduction of approximately 20 percent
9068437 we have already slashed water usage by 20 percent for landscape and lighting districts local parks and city property and were continuing to monitor and correct any overflow problems in those areas
9068438 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough

9068454 gears of war 2 that carmine is in fact his brother benjamin
9068455 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
9068456 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
9068457 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
9068458 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9068459 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
9068460 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
9068461 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9068462 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
9068463 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
9068464 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
9068465 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
9068466 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
9068467 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
9068468 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
9068469 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
9068470 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
9068471 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
9068472 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
9068473 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9068474 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
9068475 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
9068476 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
9068477 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
9068478 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
9068479 i can do everything through him who gives me strength
9068480 i just am excited to be fighting for john mccain
9068481 i dont know who its going to be mccain live mccain

9068493 on august 29th 2008 at 9 04 am nc blue said
9068494 i just saw on boortz that palin signed a big pipeline contract wednesday with a canadian company to bring natural gas off the north slope she gets up early in the morning to go moose hunting she sued the bush admin for putting the polar bear on the endangered species list she has more gravitas than most repubs let biden show his arrogance against her in a debate and torque off all the women voters let the fun begin
9068495 certainly being associated with the organization makes that a lot more possible there have been conversations for a lot of years about me being part of a performance at a super bowl

9068502 everything that has ever portrayed our world has gotten it insultingly wrong
9068503 the portrayal of public defenders is as schlubby disillusioned generally incompetent people who cant get other jobs the reality is that my bronx office hired people from harvard and yale nobody believes it
9068504 i dont want people to think the public defenders are the good guys and the das office are the bad guys
9068505 were going for the gray areas i hope people are entranced with what michelle does shes not someone you can root for all the time

9068509 they were obsessed with legends and myths associated with archaeological sites pagan rituals and green men
9068510 and the idea of rural britain as a rather eccentric place they were also invariably enthusiastic about wherever it was they were writing about even if it wasnt especially thrilling
9068511 today weve got the likes of the rough guides which are only interested in places they regard as cool and thus dismiss swathes of britain as not worth visiting
9068512 peppered with barrows and haunted by many well authenticated ghosts including a pack of hounds
9068513 its there in our growing enthusiasm for local food and folklore and in strains of new age thinking
9068514 the shell vision also inspired a generation of childrens stories such as catweazle and stig of the dump and the idea that it was perfectly possible to meet a stone age man at the bottom of your garden
9068515 you could say the shell philosophy reached its ultimate expression in the film the wicker man
9068516 and the idea that villagers would welcome you into their homes and pubs and then burn you alive
9068517 the arctic is a vast ocean and to find nine bears swimming in one area is extremely worrying because it means that dozens more are probably in the same predicament
9068518 the summer melting used to slow down by the beginning of september

9068520 now we have a recession youll hear an awful lot less about the bloody environment
9068521 i would still try to buy the most ethical and environmentally friendly products i could even if it meant paying a little extra
9068522 look again its a village not the time ilam dovedale not 11am
9068523 do you know a tourist went up to one of the local coppers and asked can you tell me where 11am is just after 10 and before 12 the policeman replied

9068528 even so we didnt stop going backwards until 1986 and it wasnt until 1998 that we finally paid off the debts
9068529 theres no question of tenants being hit with constant rent increases
9068530 the way our rent here is fixed is that i go out for a long lunch with patricks son peter whos a solicitor and we reach an amicable agreement

9068535 european bat weekend is an ideal way for people to learn more about the problems facing bats and to find out how they can help
9068536 bat walks offer people a truly magical way of seeing and hearing bats in their natural environment the bat conservation trust is happy to be able to share this experience with so many people
9068537 the importance of bats as a group species and as an indicator of the health of the rest of our wildlife is not always recognised which is why the bat conservation trusts work to raise the profile of these unique animals is so valuable

9068555 we are the only country in the world that locks up so much potential supply
9068556 we are not too far away from the time all of us will be plugging in our cars and trucks at night
9068557 the delivery system of plug in cars is already there
9068558 it will work senator mccains wrong on that issue i think hes going to evolve into eventually supporting anwr opening obama is way off base on all that i think those politicians who dont understand that we need more domestic supplies of energy thrown into our hungry markets are living in la la land
9068559 what is it exactly that the vp does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard and being in administration

9068561 if the alaskan state legislature passed a death penalty law i would sign it we have a right to know that someone who rapes and murders a child or kills an innocent person in a drive by shooting will never be able to do that again
9068562 we are suing the federal government recognising that the endangered species act is not a place to kind of mess around with listing as threatened a species that right now is very very healthy our fear being that extreme environmentalists will use this tool to eventually curtail or halt north slope production of very rich resources that america needs

9068586 when crime escalates to the point it becomes an unacceptable risk to public safety whether at an apartment complex or in an historic neighborhood residents should be able to expect swift intense police intervention but under a proposal by columbia mayor bob coble if you live in an apartment complex beset with crime you would have to depend on your landlord
9068587 if you live in an apartment complex owned by an absentee landlord and funded by the federal government that consistently rents to drug dealers and other criminals and the columbia police and richland county sheriff deputies are constantly coming to the same apartments time and time again and the level of crime on the private property owned by your absentee landlord exceeds one percent of total major crime in the city then your absentee landlord has a responsibility to be part of the solution

9068591 there is no quick fix no magic bullet its relentless scrutiny of attendance behaviour maintaining quality of teaching and learning its basic old fashioned things
9068592 academies were always intended to provide a good school to children in the most deprived postcodes i am most proud of the fact that weve achieved that
9068593 this is a marathon not a sprint we want steady incremental improvements that we can sustain
9068594 this data shows that the government should not expect schools to turn round in a year schools might go up and down but you need to look over a longer timeframe
9068595 whilst it is clear that many academies are achieving excellent results this data shows that in some schools the performance is less impressive
9068596 the strong upward trend in academy gcse results has continued this year 27 of the 36 academies with results this year and last report an increase in the proportion gaining five or more higher grade gcse passes including in english and maths across all these 36 academies the average reported result is an increase of 4 9 percentage points which is likely to be more than twice the national increase this is a similar academy bonus to that recorded in previous years every one of the academies recording a fall this year still has results higher than that of the underperforming school it replaced over 12 percentage points higher on average
9068597 ich bin sehr gl cklich die mannschaft spielte sehr gut und kann sich zu diesem sieg gratulieren lassen denn united ist ein starkes team zenit spielte sowohl im angriff als auch in der verteidigung sehr gut

9068599 danny hat viel geld gekostet und er ist ein sehr guter fu baller davon konnten sich alle heute berzeugen
9068600 theres never in my experience been so many changes in such a short time add to that the ambitions of the childrens plan and it is a massive agenda for every school in the country its too much at once
9068601 each of these changes has merit but the problem is the numbers that are coming at one time
9068602 thats why i dont hold any divisive opinions about anything

9068610 heres a doctor who got well enough acquainted with the computer in those days and really led the way
9068611 he was a truly important person although he never pushed himself to the front never cared about publicity
9068612 as a result a lot of people except in his field of hypertension and clinical pharmacology really dont know what he has done
9068613 he was creative and got people to do things that they hadnt thought of doing before

9068629 proposal calls on delegates from the u n and some foreign countries to be involved in talks to solve the dispute over kirkuk
9068630 the u s wants to expand nato into the black sea and as in iraq this will create a mess in our neighborhood leaving us to deal with the consequences once america eventually pulls out after all if russia is agitated it wont be the americans that will have to deal with them
9068631 now that we have an accurate way to count these cells we are able to confirm what we long suspected that blacks might have a bigger army of hla specific b cells
9068632 if the recipient is not sensitized b cells represent only a patients potential for making antibodies
9068633 however about a third of patients in need of a kidney are sensitized since theyre often on their second or third transplantation and may have undergone transfusions
9068634 knowing that blacks have an increased number of hla specific b cells which increases their opportunity for antibody mediated rejection we may be able to customize treatments for black recipients to account for these differences and lessen the likelihood that the organ will be rejected
9068635 i think this says that america in the 21st century is much different than america in the 20th century
9068636 are now being realized in all areas of american life even the highest levels of elective office the presidency and vice presidency
9068637 the pipeline of potential national candidates is up and gubernatorial candidates are up
9068638 everything from what brede place looked like in 1900 to the price of a marble statue if sculpted by a mediocre artist of moderate fame
9068639 would start his infernal rumbling in search of the right word as if he were an espresso pot
9068640 our national red cross and all the chapters around are exceptionally prepared
9068641 weve met all of our certification standards to be a level 2 disaster chapter which means we can hold our own in any size disaster for about 5 days within 2 or 3 days we get a lot of resources from our other chapters around us and other states around us
9068642 the court is well aware that there are real risks to the class associated with the settlement that it finally approves today
9068643 however like the parties the court has evaluated these risks in light of the even greater risks of not settling this dispute
9068644 we own the world so what does it matter what others think

9068655 if we keep on going long enough we run out of road or we get back to where we started but they keep building new roads so we can never run out
9068656 giving special treatment out of sympathy to one property owner or waiving the statutory requirements of one property owner because his case was reported by the media when there are dozens of others whose homes may have been foreclosed upon after personal difficulties would destroy the integrity
9068657 city employees are very busy foreclosing on lots of shitty property far too much shitty property for us to ever stop and ask if maybe a delinquent homeowner is mentally compromised or having some kind of personal issue that is preventing them from following the letter of the law it is not the duty of government to help people or understand their problems rather it is simply our job is to take their shit when they dont give us our money
9068658 shes been a pilot a hunter a tv announcer a small business owner an ice fisherman shes a sportswoman a former beauty queen a governor and a mother smart beautiful ambitious woman who wants to make a difference shes sarah palin and shes exactly the kind of woman i dreamed of being when i was a girl

9068661 the ottawa senators have traded defenceman andrej meszaros to the tampa bay lightning for defencemen filip kuba alexandre picard and a first round pick previously acquired from san jose

9068663 i look forward to showing the broadway fans from new york and around the world just what we have to offer
9068664 i dont know what else to do i think that this is the only option left at this time
9068665 probably the toughest thing that i had to battle with and i still battle with it now is i knew in order for my daughter to live another kid had to die
9068666 i struggled with it and struggle with it and the biggest thing that i got out of it was youre taking something negative and turning it into a positive instead of just having two negatives
9068667 what we tried to do as the bears organization for charles was just let him know we were there for him whatever we could do to help we would do it and as far as camp and football and things like that i told charles if he felt like coming to practice come to practice but take care of his family and go from there
9068668 i think the purpose of this press conference is really not to tell my story but just to let people know about organ donation get that awareness out to everyone
9068669 were bringing people throughout the company together every morning at 8 oclock we start off with a weather update from lucas mcdonald talking about what the latest forecast is for the storm and what that means for our business and how it could potentially change in the days ahead
9068670 before gustav was ever categorized as a tropical depression by the national hurricane center we were watching a tropical wave moving across the atlantic and saying this is what we have and this is what may be happening here in the next couple of weeks
9068671 were talking about getting merchandise to areas and making sure that people have access to water batteries flashlights gas cans all the types of things that people want during a hurricane to prepare for a hurricane
9068672 facilities along that interstate are going to be very busy we need to make sure weve got enough water and gas and everything those customers may need
9068673 ultimately we wanna make sure that the communities in which we operate are able to fully come back after a storm like hurricane gustav
9068674 our goal was to create a new and distinctive series for jesse that is unlike anything else on television

9068676 defend the orphan an age old christian lesson gets a new lease on life
9068677 adopted for life the priority of adoption for christian families and churches
9068678 in any given church you rarely see only one family who has adopted it becomes part of the culture of the congregation
9068679 i ask for respec advertisement t and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
9068680 theres a battle within the therapy world between the pros and antis
9068681 youve got psychiatrists on the one hand who like labelling conditions as medical because then they can treat them but its equally true that behaviour that causes distress to self and others about sex is different to heroin cocaine or tobacco
9068682 its like any addiction its behaviour lacking in meaning and humans are meaning seeking creatures
9068683 at relate we see it is on the increase we have to be careful about what we define as addiction and i think a lot of people who want to have more sex than their partners automatically assume they have an addiction that might not be the case it may be that a discrepancy in libido
9068684 people assume theres some sort of infidelity or visiting prostitutes going on
9068685 many people who come to relate will complain about their use of the internet because they can become addicted to looking at sexual images or going into chatrooms and that can cause distress in the relationship
9068686 i left at 2 30am and people were nowhere close to ending the dance party the date farmers were rolling sauced and happy and maya hayuks photo booth piece was a raging success with partygoers collecting up photo booth style shots of them with friends and strangers alike
9068687 unconventional 08 was definitely the event to be at wednesday night plenty of locals also did their best at talking themselves into the space as was invesco field at mile high for baracks speech last night
9068688 i love you all just remember every one of these songs i sing is with love for you
9068689 the night ended with barack as the cherry topped sundae of course who spoke to the crowd of 76 000 about his goals as president and why his change is one everyone can believe in
9068690 one of the things were trying to evaluate is how well we can have a practical option as much as we need it
9068691 we want to take every match as if its a time to celebrate the effort the time the commitment and the preparation from the weeks before today we saw a lot of really good things the biggest thing was that we did a good job at making some adjustments on a team that we didnt have much of an opportunity to scout because its our first match of the year when you play a match with no information on your opponent its a great thing to see your players really engaged in what youre teaching
9068692 that rally was about sustaining effort for a long period of time and understanding that if we can better the ball and make plays points will become simpler
9068693 its something that we stress at practice and they did a really good job at that today
9068694 our goal is to have an identity that we are so efficient in limiting our errors and earning points that we put pressure on other teams to score
9068695 we are continually working on our level of ball control so that we can limit our errors and our progress was shown with our results today
9068696 as i said yesterday in new york he was improving it was just less than 100 percent
9068697 sure there was concern but we were optimistic today we got great news and its a relief even though we werent completely panicked to get reassurance is good news and a big relief
9068698 im not a doctor but the best guess was sort of a slightly irritated nerve that was exacerbated by sleeping funny on it and pitching through it
9068699 theres nothing structural at all its a very healthy elbow ligament and nerve
9068700 everything came out i guess the word would be awesome from our standpoint
9068701 i dont know that he used that word everything was clean a number of tests and josh came through it with flying colors which i think was what we certainly hoped
9068702 we just needed to as theo stated yesterday kind of get some closure when josh threw the other day in a 50 pitch side session tuesday at yankee stadium i got so excited about the way he threw the ball
9068703 as we visited with him a little more as the week progressed he just had that look in his eye so we kinda kept pushing him pushing him and pushing him and we all felt like this was the best thing to do
9068704 if youre a first baseman and youre knee hurts you go out and limp through the game if youre a pitcher and you throwing about 97 its nice to know that when you let it go youre going to be ok i think we all feel good about the way we did it
9068705 it went good just a little bit stiff now had some dye put in there it was definitely good news
9068706 we put it off because everybody is scared at some point both me and the organization
9068707 i just wanted to and not that i think dr andrews is a clown because theres no one that i respect more but i just wanted to hear it from the clowns mouth as the saying goes
9068708 thats what i was afraid of i know a lot of guys have come back from it but tommy john surgery thats what i was afraid of
9068709 again because some of the tests he may pick up a ball saturday and he may not
9068710 id say a fair scenario is hopefully he pitches that first day in texas which is week from today if it doesnt come true well change it but looking at the rest of the year if it doesnt come true well change it
9068711 i dont mean to sound flippant about it because i certainly wasnt but i didnt think anything was wrong with him were just trying to take care of him hes a big part of our present and our future but i think wed feel that way about anybody it was the right thing to do
9068712 one of the things were trying to evaluate is how well we can have a practical option as much as we need it
9068713 we want to take every match as if its a time to celebrate the effort the time the commitment and the preparation from the weeks before today we saw a lot of really good things the biggest thing was that we did a good job at making some adjustments on a team that we didnt have much of an opportunity to scout because its our first match of the year when you play a match with no information on your opponent its a great thing to see your players really engaged in what youre teaching
9068714 that rally was about sustaining effort for a long period of time and understanding that if we can better the ball and make plays points will become simpler
9068715 its something that we stress at practice and they did a really good job at that today
9068716 our goal is to have an identity that we are so efficient in limiting our errors and earning points that we put pressure on other teams to score
9068717 we are continually working on our level of ball control so that we can limit our errors and our progress was shown with our results today
9068718 it was historic i brought them so they could witness history
9068719 were americans we can do anything when we put our minds to it
9068720 im just blessed i could be here to see this day
9068721 because i never thought i would see it and now ive seen this ive seen it all my mothers still alive and she still cant believe it this is history honey
9068722 ive got to be honest with you i never thought a black man would get this far
9068723 but a lot of white people are hurting too right now theyre losing houses and jobs so theyre beginning to look past the colour thing
9068724 i just hope he doesnt get killed theyve done it before
9068725 if the money can be raised to buy this painting
9068726 then the duke of sutherland will offer the gallery a second titian on the cheap for fifty million in the art world of today its a knockdown price
9068727 the british seem to like to laugh about their own stupidity in a funny way
9068728 during the performance when the london bus pulled over all the passengers waiting for the bus rushed into the door at the same time which truly damaged the british image
9068729 its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
9068730 they just dont have time to feel the joy of life
9068731 throughout the week they all work so hard they only talk to people at lunch break then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
9068732 i do accept that the money can create a distance between the working class and a working class player
9068733 it would be great to see people cheering us along in what im sure will be a memorable sight
9068734 when the idea of the convoy to commemorate the life of colin was born we never dreamt 1 300 subarus would be taking part we even have subarus joining us from all over europe from poland and the ukraine to france and spain while some fans are flying in especially from australia and argentina to be part of this memorable occasion
9068735 esperamos conseguir un incremento significativo para que quien asuma los destinos del poder judicial en el periodo siguiente tenga un buen instrumento de gesti n
9068736 quien no siente hasta ahora como una pol tica de estado el sistema de impartici n de justicia
9068737 thats what i think every time i tuck my children up at night
9068738 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine these are my heroes
9068739 if john mccain to have a debate about who has the temperament to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
9068740 let us agree that patriotism has no party so ive got news for you we all put our country first
9068741 dont believe everything you read theres a lot of rumour and speculation out there about kindle
9068742 one thing i can tell you for sure is that there will be no new version of kindle this year a new version will come out sometime next year at the earliest
9068743 we were down for about down for about 2 1 2 days with katrina then up and operating
9068744 we learned a lot from that experience and are setting up accordingly
9068745 the population largely indifferent to these issues for generations are now all of a sudden realizing they have to do homework on their banks
9068746 it is interesting to see how consumers react because they are still waking up to this and banks really have to hammer home their capital position
9068747 we felt it was important to assume both insured and uninsured deposits and we believe it is our responsibility as a leading national institution to work with and support the fdic in providing safe harbors for depositors in this challenging time
9068748 despite todays announcement it is important to emphasize that the overwhelming majority of banks operating in georgia 96 percent are well capitalized and have adequate reserves
9068749 the population largely indifferent to these issues for generations are now all of a sudden realizing they have to do homework on their banks
9068750 it is interesting to see how consumers react because they are still waking up to this and banks really have to hammer home their capital position
9068751 perversion of justice on a remarkable and almost unprecedented scale
9068752 these results show the strong growth in the groups profitability
9068753 consumers pulled back on real spending in both june and july in the face of weak employment conditions higher energy prices and further declines in household net worth
9068754 we think the worst is yet to come for consumers
9068755 were not thinking about that at all everyones focus is on registering new voters
9068756 my first thought would be the adviser should be whoever is the president of the
9068757 i think we need someone in there whos really understanding of indian issues not just a bureaucrat
9068758 hes represented minorities well and is very much in tune with native american causes
9068759 i look up to him and hes younger than me
9068760 if we start thinking about anything like that were doing a disservice to indian country
9068761 im honored to be governor of the great state of minnesota
9068762 i congratulated him on the pick and told him that im very excited about the pick
9068763 today i feel a little bit like i did when i was in high school and one of my best friends was cut from our basketball team in the final cut
9068764 that experience at the local and state level will be helpful
9068765 it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that ceiling once and for all
9068766 gender alone does not seem to be a factor influencing how women are going to vote
9068767 theyre going to look at the issues and theyre going to cover a whole other range of issues not just simply the gender of the candidate running
9068768 well let this election pass and get into early 2009 then well make an announcement about re election plans
9068769 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9068770 it appears chicken is still being used as a political tool
9068771 i commend these institutions and organizations for their leadership in expanding the availability of humanities programs that enrich the culture of our commonwealth
9068772 most of the students have been the first in their family to start thinking about college so we walk them through the process
9068773 some people are like how can you do this all summer long they say its stupid
9068774 we follow them from the time they meet here until the time they get accepted to college
9068775 we say to them its about how much you want it
9068776 theyre basically like our parents because theyre always over us watching
9068777 these students may never have thought of themselves as potential college students
9068778 look at this wonderful powerful woman who decided to give birth to a child that she knew would have serious life threatening health and developmental issues instead of having an abortion
9068779 we had some trouble siding out in the first half of game one but once we got into a groove our whole game got much better
9068780 krupsky was extremely aggressive and fissel did a nice job of spreading the ball around the court seventeen kills in a three game sweep with the new 25 point format is pretty impressive
9068781 its a key to our success and i was very pleased with their effort
9068782 maryland is going to go through some ups and downs with a new coaching staff but to beat this team and especially to sweep them is a major accomplishment we are chomping at the bit and i was very proud of the way we never let up
9068783 in such situations russian diplomats will have to leave georgia
9068784 we regret this step from the georgian side it will not assist our bilateral relations
9068785 would be very awkward to have a diplomatic relationship with russia when russia will be setting up diplomatic relations with south ossetia and abkhazia
9068786 no moral right to the role of mentor in matters of international relations and to judge the actions of other states
9068787 even during the cold war regardless of political or other circumstances the soviet union always promptly met its contractual obligations to deliver energy to europe and russia being a responsible and reliable partner will also uphold such principles
9068788 made the international situation much more tense the direct consequence being a forceful strengthening of natos military and political position and all that will be happening close to our borders
9068789 i think we will shortly be witness to a dramatic change of the east west policies
9068790 shes got the grit integrity good sense and fierce devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in washington today
9068791 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down shes fought oil companies and party bosses and do nothing bureaucrats and anyone who puts their interests before the people of whom she swore an oath to serve
9068792 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9068793 knows what its like to worry about mortgage payments and health care and the cost of gasoline and groceries
9068794 she leads a state that matters to every one of us alaska has significant energy resources and she has been a leader in the fight to make america energy independent
9068795 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9068796 an outstanding pick from the choices that were on the table
9068797 governor sarah palin is an outspoken advocate for pro family policies that energize social conservatives
9068798 it clearly makes it more difficult for mccain to criticize obamas experience
9068799 is dre simply placing a mirror up against our misogynistic xenophobic and materialistic society
9068800 at what point after this did the concept of pimp chic appear in popular culture
9068801 i guess im surprised there are still so many people out there who havent done it
9068802 its hard to reach out because unless theyre affiliated with a senior center or some other group its hard to get the word out to them
9068803 they may think its too late but its not too late
9068804 our goal is to make sure that individuals get their money in their hands as fast as they can and make sure that they know that they are eligible to receive that money
9068805 querida o m dico proibiu me van goghs ticianos e tudo quanto seja impressionista agora s posso ver umas coisinhas abstractas uma aguarelas inglesas e um pr rafaelita de vez em quando rubens por exemplo nem pensar d me logo palpita es
9068806 john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time
9068807 seriously youd vote for a candidate that will put the justices on the supreme court neede to ensure the overturning of roe v wade and any meaningful equal rights legislation all because of a selection that you yourself admit reaks of tokanism im not saying you have to be in the tank for obama but realize that a mccain administration would be devastating for womens rights whether there is a woman on the ticket or not

9068810 consumers pulled back on real spending in both june and july in the face of weak employment conditions higher energy prices and further declines in household net worth
9068811 we think the worst is yet to come for consumers

9068813 the american kennel club akc announced today that the public has elected a poodle as their breed of choice for the obama family
9068814 hes going to say that he works for amazon com where this very bread maker is sold

9068839 we made a deliberate decision to take the siddhivinayak ganapati to as many people as we could
9068840 when you get the prasad it makes you believe that your prayer has reached the destination
9068841 we have taken siddhivinyak to their televisions now people with a tata sky connection can see the idol from their homes we have installed a camera that is always on inside the temple
9068842 whats important is the social message of this film it begins with an animation that shows a baby ganapati circling his mother and father when they ask him to go around the world the message is clear make your parents the centre of your world dont leave them in old age homes and come to the temple expecting this god to be pleased with you
9068843 the real possibility of terrorists going on a rampage inside the temple or ramming a truck filled with explosives through its walls
9068844 so we were advised by the police to build a wall we installed closed circuit televisions all around the temple set up one entrance manned by armed security personnel metal detectors and x ray machines
9068845 we need these security systems we need the police and the undercover protection as well

9068900 b efore the speech you wrote in the wall street journal that you were unimpressed with the staging the greek column look the hugeness of the arena
9068901 the speech itself lacked lift but had heft it wasnt precisely long on hope but i think it showed audacity this was not smiling o he was not the charmer or the celebrity and he didnt try much humor mr obama often looked stern and somewhat indignant
9068902 look im going to have 30 35 maybe even 40 million people watching tonight a lot of them have never seen me before theyve seen me from out of the side their eye when they walk by a television but they havent really focused on me im going make them focus on me tonight but in a different way im not going to be charming lovely vaguely humorous interesting and expansive on the issues im going to be a very serious seriously adult person talking about
9068903 i picked him up and carried him back over to the median
9068904 on behalf of all the residents of westchester county we thank you from the bottom of our heart
9068905 the last time we saw him he wasnt even talking
9068906 very seldom do we have the pleasure of such a save
9068907 he came back with a nice family like this why wouldnt he
9068908 we believe land should be owned by new zealand citizens and residents only and our laws should be changed to say that we welcome ex pats coming home and people coming to this country to live but why should we allow singaporean australian or american speculators to buy investment properties in our country shutting first time home buyers from the market
9068909 i dont think there are hundreds of people just buying up new zealand we do sell houses to overseas buyers but it isnt a big deal the percentage is very minimal the people ive been dealing with recently tend to be first home buyers and people moving to hamilton from other parts of the country
9068910 the report makes it sound like new zealand is for sale but it isnt undoubtedly there is a number of overseas buyers looking after all its the only way they can look at a property looking at real estate is escapist thats why we have so much traffic people go online just to look sometimes its not like a bank website where you have to use it
9068911 on an average month our site gets around 270 000 unique visitors for the waikato in an average month around 370 000 pages are viewed about 12 000 pages viewed per day the waikato is the region of the country that has the lowest ratio of international visitors just 17 per cent the top region for international traffic is nelson bays with 39 per cent of all visitors from outside new zealand

9068915 youve got boomsday going on it will be a busy weekend
9068916 put this in the mtv news headline fat joe says daddy yankee is a sellout
9068917 the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him
9068918 how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure
9068919 if he believes john mccain is the better candidate for the latinos we could sit down even if he wants to get into a debate we can debate anywhere new york puerto rico
9068920 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me
9068921 i have stopped using a false name so i think all parties should do the same
9068922 i will not plead in line with my standpoint as regards this court
9068923 i feel like were in the beginning stages of being able to be to put our best foot forward
9068924 with our absolute best group that we can put out on the field
9068925 we have to deal with the reality of his knee not responding well right now
9068926 i dont know if we can afford as a team to keep him active unless he can predict that he can come through
9068927 i think hes going to have to play with some soreness
9068928 thats going to be a battle i think thats a very close battle
9068929 hes been a great part of this offense but were just evaluating and i thought stephon came in and did a pretty job
9068930 needs to continue to mature mentally in the passing game
9068931 thats the history of this offense basically is the passing game has been behind the run game the defense the special teams
9068932 and then as it comes on then you start hitting on all cylinders
9068933 if he doesnt progress well and doesnt practice this week i probably will hold him out
9068934 his work is significant for meijer gardens because it directly addresses the connection between art and life and how each fit within the natural world
9068935 guests are undeniably drawn to plensas sculpture he purposefully selects materials and sites in graceful harmony that entices participation and encourages contemplation a flawless match to our gardens
9068936 my work has tried to reconcile opposites it is perhaps inside that friction of dualities where i can raise the big questions in a more suitable way and in their own impossibility find the path of emotion
9068937 the mission of the gibbes is to tell the story of the visual culture of the south and the plantation has been and still continues to be a defining characteristic of the history and present state of the region the museums collection includes several important works related to the subject and we were inspired to lead an effort to unravel the realities and fictions that surround the subject matter
9068938 more than a history of the visual imagery related to the plantation the show invites one to consider the impact that this imagery has had on race relations for three centuries
9068939 we are very pleased to have this opportunity to work with our colleagues at the gibbes museum particularly on a project of this quality and scope
9068940 the modern american vice presidency the transformation of a political institution
9068941 im stunned by the choice of governor sarah palin just as i would have been surprised had senator obama picked governor kaine or senator mccain picked governor crist i think that a threshold choice for a vice presidential selection is that the candidate has to
9068942 we have not had a vice presidential candidate with so little relevant experience since spiro t
9068943 on the other hand there are disturbing things about the choice
9068944 it should be hard for even a republican partisan to credit claims that senator obama is not ready when senator mccain chose someone with far less experience on a quantitative or qualitative basis
9068945 did the choice of governor palin instead of someone like secretary ridge represent a cave to the right wing
9068946 unless senator mccain has determined that she really is the second coming of lincoln the choice might lead one to infer that he thinks he has a very uphill race
9068947 governor palin will present some tactical problems for senator biden in the debate the expectations game will be all in her favor with a low bar she could lose the debate and still win
9068948 we want to have a product with total traceability from cane seeding to the final product we believe theres a market for this kind of product especially in europe
9068949 many people say sugar and ethanol are only for large scale producers and were showing this is not true these are small suppliers who are organized and looking ahead
9068950 it would be great to see people cheering us along in what im sure will be a memorable sight
9068951 when the idea of the convoy to commemorate the life of colin was born we never dreamt 1 300 subarus would be taking part we even have subarus joining us from all over europe from poland and the ukraine to france and spain while some fans are flying in especially from australia and argentina to be part of this memorable occasion
9068952 is palin the first pentecostal to make it on a major national political ticket
9068953 teach both you know dont be afraid of information healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both
9068954 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class
9068955 s hould public schools teach alternatives to evolution such as creationism and intelligent design
9068956 adamantly supported our cause since i first understood as a child the atrocity of abortion
9068957 i believe in the strength and the power of women and the potential of every human life
9068958 i believe that honoring the family structure is that important
9068959 the new governor has been very supportive of the office and what we are doing in our communities
9068960 but its been challenging to encourage the legislature to take the big picture of what this office does we dont proselytize but we look at the value of faith based organizations partnering with government to meet the needs of alaska
9068961 we would be able to take the grants statewide instead of just the three areas
9068962 at four to five times the same rate it makes sense to me but as it is it would be taking the same amount of butter and spreading it over a lot more bread
9068963 a pastor a priest a rabbi certainly they have the freedom to say whatever they want to say and you know thank the lord that we do have that freedom of speech
9068964 faith is very important to so many of us here in america and i would never support any government effort to stifle our freedom of religion or freedom of expression or freedom of speech
9068965 you know i would just caution maybe a pastor to be very careful if theyre in front of a congregation and they decide to endorse one candidate over another
9068966 many are the women of proven worth but you have excelled them all
9068967 its a great win win they get to have a great time harvesting and eat a ton of blueberries and then also the money for the local berries goes back to the local farmers kids have a blast and we support our local farms
9068968 boom i can fill my freezer full in two days and i dont have jam on the bottom
9068969 the past two days i did 700 pounds of berries versus a week of doing 700 pounds of berries
9068970 i got a stockpile of berries to sell now otherwise the birds bears and raccoons are going to eat them all you know
9068971 we try to keep not eating but theyre so good
9068972 when one looks at the circumstances leading to the discharge order it is open to the possibility that the state is fishing for more evidence and endeavouring to justify the inherent weakness in the evidence to begin with
9068973 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable
9068974 whenever we go to the institute the tutors promise us it will happen at the beginning of the month but when that time comes around they tell us end of the month it will happen
9068975 but that hasnt happened and its high time they just tell us the truth
9068976 some of us loaned from the banks to pay for their fees and we are being hounded by those we borrowed money from on the promise that once our daughters graduated we will pay back what we owe
9068977 but how can we do that when they havent been hired
9068978 we cant leave the country and seek employment overseas because we havent yet served our bonds for the scholarships we studied on
9068979 but the government is not obligated to provide the students jobs
9068980 however we have been trying to help the graduates and the ministry of health and psc has assured us that there are vacancies that will be filled by our graduates
9068981 it was like something out of a movie scene real but unbelievable

9069016 progress continues and we are now planning to submit the environmental impact assessment report and application once there is greater clarity on carbon dioxide regulations and we are able to better align our project with the timing of our potential customers
9069017 we will be reaching out to the provincial government and regulators to discuss some of our concerns
9069018 this just gives us more options just to figure out what is the best thing to meet our potential customers needs
9069019 alberta has given industry clear signals to where we are headed when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions
9069020 alberta has been the regulator and we want to have one regulator when it comes to industry and will work with the federal government to ensure that alberta continues to be that regulator
9069021 i know im a nasty skank and my husband likes it that way
9069022 the prime ministers legal actions are an attempt to use the courts to interfere with the official oppositions freedom of political expression and thereby give his party an advantage over his principal political opponents
9069023 such an injection of legal action into our political debates were it to succeed would give the government party a political advantage over its opponents
9069024 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment

9069036 freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth order cannot be secured merely through fear of punishment for its infraction that it is hazardous to discourage thought hope and imagination that fear breeds repression that repression breeds hate that hate menaces stable government that the path of safety lies in the opportunity to discuss freely supposed grievances and proposed remedies and that the fitting remedy for evil counsels is good ones the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market
9069037 persecution for the expression of opinions seems to me perfectly logical if you have no doubt of your premises or your power and want a certain result with all your heart you naturally express your wishes in law and sweep away all opposition
9069038 to determine whether a statement is an opinion or fact the court must look at the totality of the circumstances
9069039 broad context which includes the general tenor of the entire work the subject of the statement the setting and the format of the work
9069040 analyzing the extent of figurative or hyperbolic language used and the reasonable expectations of the audience in that particular situation
9069041 sufficiently factual to be susceptible of being proved true or false
9069042 the first amendment serves not only the needs of the polity but also those of the human spirit a spirit that demands self expression
9069043 have constitutional rights to free speech and privacy which allow them to express themselves in a public forum such as the internet while keeping their identities secret
9069044 t his need for identity information must be balanced against the legitimate and valuable right to participate in online forums anonymously or pseudonymously people are permitted to interact pseudonymously and anonymously with each other so long as those acts are not in violation of the law this ability to speak ones mind without the burden of the other party knowing all the facts about ones identity can foster open communication and robust debate furthermore it permits persons to obtain information relevant to a sensitive or intimate condition without fear of embarrassment people who have committed no wrong should be able to participate online without fear that someone who wishes to harass or embarrass them can file a frivolous lawsuit and thereby gain the power of the courts order to discover their identity
9069045 namely that disclosure was warranted because cahill had established through his pleadings that he had a legitimate good faith basis on which to bring the defamation claim
9069046 one persons right to speak anonymously against another persons right to protect his reputation
9069047 might encourage meritless lawsuits brought merely to uncover the identities of anonymous critics
9069048 powerful entities are learning that they can use the courts to silence their critics when individuals choose to participate in a public debate anonymously they should not have to worry that their identities will be divulged to anyone who doesnt like what they have to say
9069049 short of a gun to the head a greater threat to first amendment expression can scarcely be imagined
9069050 the right to engage in anonymous communication is fundamental to a free society its critical that judges resist attempts by anyone public officials especially to turn courtrooms into vehicles to harass and intimidate people out of speaking their minds thankfully court after court has recognized that a plaintiff doesnt have an automatic right to pierce anonymity just because he doesnt like what someone has said
9069051 allah jadikan bulan ramadhan sebagai bulan persaingan merebut untuk mendapatkan ketaatan dan keredhaannya ada sebahagian kaum merebutnya dan berjaya dan ada yang terkebelakang dan mereka rugi peliknya hari itu orang orang muhsinin sentiasa berjaya dan orang orang yang melakukan kebatilan selalunya mengalami kerugian
9069052 manusia biasa memberikan tahniah dikalangan mereka dengan kedatangan ramadhan masakan tidak kerana bulan ini dibuka kepada orang mukmin pintu pintu syurga orang orang berdosa pula menjadi berita gembira kerana pintu neraka ditutup bagaimana tidak gembira kepada orang orang yang lalai tatkala syaitan syaitan digari
9069053 sebaik baik manusia adalah yang dapat memberi manfaat kepada manusia yang lain
9069054 barangsiapa yang memberi makan ketika berbuka kepada orang yang berpuasa pahalanya sama seperti pahala orang tersebut tidak berkurang walau sedikitpun yakni sama
9069055 sahabat itu sebenarnya seorang yang mengingatkan kita kepada allah dan apabila kita lupa dia akan mengingatkannya
9069056 jadikan dirimu duduk dengan orang orang yang hanya memandang dunia ini bukan matlamat asalnya zuhud dan sering mengajakmu melakukan kebaikan untuk akhirat dan elakkan dirimu dari duduk bersama orang orang yang suka membincangkan perkara perkara dunia secara melampau ia boleh merosakanmu agamamu dan hatimu
9069057 mukmin itu ibarat satu badan dari segi kasih sayangnya jika sakit salah satu anggota yang lain turut merasai keperitannya
9069058 sesiapa yang memudahkan urusan saudaranya allah pula akan memudahkan urusannya

9069151 i am very disappointed to go out of the fa cup at this stage and at the moment i am angry with our second half performance and i have let the players know that
9069152 the fa cup is a very important competition for us financially and also because of the prestige and history it holds and it would have meant a lot to progress to the next round

9069158 weve really struggled since then with what to do with the mall in new bern
9069159 it has kind of puzzled us but we do want to reintroduce this 30 year old asset to the community as somewhere they want to go
9069160 we told them it was to the benefit of them and the community to get in there and renovate
9069161 thats a question i got more than any other in the past of why they hadnt its not been a question of late as much as a statement of how pitiful it is
9069162 we are well capitalized and can financially do anything with that property we want to do
9069163 we havent set an amount for renovations but we want to create a plaza with an upscale look we want to try to do something that matches up to the historic character of new bern
9069164 i dont want you guys sitting there talking to cindy when shes got a hammer in her hand
9069165 after discussing what we could do to address those concerns mr padilla has agreed not surrender the bond
9069166 law enforcement prosecution throughout all of this has been hoping and praying we find this child alive that hope has been somewhat diminished by recent forensics

9069189 i think republicans are more accustomed to following the rules
9069190 were used to sitting in the cheap seats weve got binoculars
9069191 if youve got an event the size of the olympics and youve got billions and billions of people watching it you definitely have a backing track and mime to it because anything could go wrong
9069192 its just a safety first thing you cannot take the risk
9069193 we share artists all the time and conductors all the time
9069194 it was all prerecorded and the mso melbourne symphony orchestra did record a minority of the music that was performed
9069195 its correct that we were basically miming to a prerecording

9069197 i am a student at one of the pitt county schools and im a very small person for my size its extremely difficult to find clothes in my size and i think its ridiculous that they are sending kids out of class just because they dont have the proper uniform on thats taking kids out of their education
9069198 i dont feel sorry for the kids or the parents who are whining its a great idea and the schools look better having well dressed kids before you know it these new rules will be everyday routine and the spoiled brats and parents will be over it

9069232 yo yo yo my negroes where all the white women at up in the hizz ouse
9069233 but i feel like weve put them in as many situations as we possibly could theyve been exposed from a football standpoint to a lot of different things that could come up in the ballgame and as a coach i think thats your responsibility to prepare them

9069243 the leaders of the sco member states welcome the signing in moscow of the six principles for regulating the south ossetia conflict and support russias active role in assisting peace and cooperation in the region
9069244 ive read that they are thought to increase the risk of cancer recurrence
9069245 certainly there is potential there because physically the russian navy is operating in the black sea so is the united states navy
9069246 weve worked hard over many years to figure out ways to both operate together operate around each other we know how to do that and i believe well continue to do that safely
9069247 the message that has come from the russians is one that is tied to invading another country invading sovereign territory
9069248 has a lot of us concerned about what it means now what it means a year from now what it means long term with our relationship on the military military side as well as the relationship between our two countries

9069323 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico

9069335 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9069336 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9069337 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9069338 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

9069411 todd and i are so proud of him and of all the fine men and women serving this country
9069412 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
9069413 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
9069414 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
9069415 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin
9069416 hay un aliciente de que nicaragua pueda ingresar a la cpi y luchar contra este tipo de cr menes
9069417 each one of those is a human being who had a life and a love i often wondered about their lives who they were what happened to them
9069418 there are so many stories well never know including those babies
9069419 im sure there were a lot of mothers holding babies trying to climb up in the attic couldnt get out couldnt break a hole in the roof we found a lot of people like that people that died in the attics thats the hard reality of what happened to us here
9069420 this is a closure for everybody its one big amen
9069421 who would have thought that three years after katrina nature is knocking on our doors again
9069422 what mother nature brings we cannot control but we can prepare
9069423 im always doing something and im always on the go i hate being sick in bed
9069424 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country then recognizing part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9069425 it wasnt a georgian attack on tskhinvali that launched all of this
9069426 it was russian pressure over a long period of time and then shelling coming from south ossetians
9069427 was not a wise thing to do because as weve seen russia was prepared to launch a major invasion
9069428 today it is a fight between the civilized and the uncivilized worlds
9069429 im very sorry for terrible harm ive caused my children
9069430 i wish to humbly apologize to society for my crime i know human life is sacred and i took the life of a human being
9069431 while we cannot say this is the source of the outbreak we also cannot rule it out
9069432 we see the well results as one piece of the puzzle and its my understanding that they the restaurant were only on well water for two hours of one day
9069433 cabrera will throw a side line on wednesday and pitch the first game of the spilt doubleheader a week from saturday against oakland
9069434 the way im looking at it is although we dont agree with it we dont think he was intentionally throwing at anybody we have to accept it and move on
9069435 hes going to have a normal winter of rest and come to spring training and go from there theres no purpose in him joining us for september
9069436 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat
9069437 i think god is reminding us that on the eve of katrina god can bring nature back
9069438 a good thing about the mausoleums is that caskets can be removed later if a family should come forth and want to bury them themselves
9069439 we decided not to look backward we decided to look forward with all the progress weve made
9069440 this is going to be a real good test for us because theyre going to come out and throw the ball at least 40 times
9069441 its a way for the secondary to make a name for ourselves in the first game
9069442 the michigan game was really a wake up call for us
9069443 we did not stop them the whole day they were up and down the field now when you go into the offseason at least you have something to point to when guys start thinking about how good they think they are
9069444 all you had to do is just turn on the film and just say hey guys lets just go back to last season and lets look at that and well see how good we really think we are
9069445 they do throw the ball around a lot and we do need to improve
9069446 this game just because of what happened last year is going to be an early test for us
9069447 every time you pick up the paper everyone is saying this team will go as their defense goes
9069448 our players are taking hold of that i dont know if itll be a rallying cry or what but i just know this theyll play a lot better than they played last year
9069449 el entendimiento es la nica forma para que bolivia pueda salir airosa
9069450 poner l mites a las desigualdades y de poder vivir en paz y armon a en una sociedad en la que tengan cabida todos los bolivianos
9069451 co ayudar en todo lo que quiera el gobierno boliviano para facilitar un di logo constructivo y sustantivo
9069452 refleja n tidamente la voluntad de los bolivianos de conciliar sus posiciones

9069454 los que salieron victoriosos del refer ndum revocatorio pueden sentirse leg timamente halagados pero el vigor renovado del voto no debe ser para golpearse con m s fuerza sino en aras de lograr la concertaci n que toda la ciudadan a les est pidiendo
9069455 i thought it was unfair to us and to him
9069456 its a very reasoned response from those jurors because they apparently recognized this was not something they were well suited to determine
9069457 in my view its going to cause the u s attorneys to give a second thought to prosecuting soldiers for acts that occurred in combat
9069458 how many jurors have been involved in a domestic dispute in which a person was killed none you dont put those people on a jury
9069459 i dont think any of us who passed that legislation thought we were now going to have people discharged from the military being charged in federal court
9069460 there are all kinds of problems with witnesses and evidence and those kinds of things in addition to the fact that military persons are operating in an environment quite different from the normal street crime we see
9069461 but its worth taking a closer look at whether civilian juries will ever have the confidence to believe they can sit in judgment in these cases
9069462 the average american is reluctant to second guess the conduct of a service person in a combat zone
9069463 coming to the knicks and hopefully being able to contribute means a lot to me
9069464 it has always been my dream to play for this team my goal is to show the coaches that i can play and do all that i can to help the team win some games
9069465 i am very happy my son will follow in my footsteps
9069466 hopefully he will have a long and productive career in new york i am proud of him and wish him nothing but success
9069467 patrick ewing will have an opportunity here to compete for a spot on our roster
9069468 he is a solid defensive player and a very good athlete
9069469 internet development and its dominant role among all other media electronic and printed continuously bring new innovations in field of expression and communication among web users
9069470 great googly moogly the gigabyte 9800gt has some game the little 9800gt is no doubt helped by the zalman cooler that keeps temperatures down i figured i might as well go for broke with the added voltage offered in the gamer hud and pushed the needle to 1 4 volts the clock speeds kept scaling upwards until i finally landed at 787mhz on the core up from 600mhz 1075mhz on the memory and 1863mhz on the shader cores these clock speeds are higher than any of the 8800gt video cards that overclockersclub has tested and represents increases of 24 on the gpu core 16 on the memory and close to 20 on the shaders not too bad if i say so myself at this level of performance there were nice increases in all of the benchmarks used why the comparison to the 8800gt because the 9800gt is the basically the same card
9069471 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9069472 is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency given sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgment it shows political panic
9069473 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
9069474 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured

9069479 the odd jellied feel of this qwerty is still uncomfortable and imprecise and more often then not youll find yourself backtracking to correct clumsy mistakes
9069480 a standard 320 x 320 resistive touchscreen and were getting a bit tired of these cramped workspaces on the treo line while everyone else is working to up the resolution pixel density and contrast ratios of their displays palm seems to be asleep at the wheel for as much plastic as we see here the abysmal lack of actual screen is annoying

9069482 weve come up with a solution to produce manufacture and distribute music which is vastly superior to the format weve been using for the last 20 years
9069483 originated from record companies and record companies have alienated customers and the artists
9069484 this is completely an artist driven initiative our aim is to democratize high fidelity
9069485 we were sending records out to the pressing plants and the record companies and they were coming back sounding nothing like what we had sent them
9069486 that was the trade off that was put into place at a time when storage was much less capacious than it is now
9069487 theres a generation who doesnt aspire to better because they havent been exposed to it
9069488 its just so much more open the high end is not so annoying and scratchy
9069489 if a guy is interested in his record sounding like it did in the studio where they made it they should be interested in doing this

9069495 a bill that underwent its second reading feb 28 at the arizona house of representatives seeks to among other things require landlords to advise their tenants 60 or more days before rental properties undergo foreclosure auction according to the arizona tenants advocates web site
9069496 we took all of our savings to move here and get this house
9069497 when i did ask him about foreclosures he said he would move us into a different house
9069498 he said he was going to get back to me but never did
9069499 he said he jake allen forgot to pay the hoa and the sewer bills
9069500 we went around and talked with the other people and they were just shocked
9069501 i started getting stressed out when i got the notices
9069502 i shouldn t have to be worried of people coming after me because i pay my bills
9069503 if any foreclosures take place it would wipe out any rental agreement
9069504 we still want to know where did the money go
9069505 vawa explicitly denies the father his constitutionally guaranteed due process
9069506 i predict future happiness for americans if they can prevent the government
9069507 cos like if you fuck wit me i get your skin and i wear it i put it on me
9069508 im gonna blast a motherfucker cos this is how we do it either he blasts me or i fucking blast that ho cos this is how i represent man im willing to die to stop the fucker killing me
9069509 i originally took six weeks off and at the end of six weeks i knew that i didnt really want to start work again this year
9069510 id always planned to leave gardeners world at the end of next year so i just thought ok ill bring it forward by a year i had become entrapped by it in a way that took me ages to realise
9069511 maybe third world countries will have to suffer as a result of our national food policy
9069512 we need to use our horticultural skills which are second to none in the world to grow food
9069513 its really important to get people aware of just how tenuous our food supply really is
9069514 for wealthy middle class people indulging in their penchant for peasant food
9069515 we dont value food in britain so therefore the cheaper it is the better it is we all eat far too much we all pay far too little for our food we have environmental problems we have health problems we have food transport problems
9069516 all one can do in the face of criticism is to say you are entitled to your view but these are things that need to be addressed the enemy or opponent we are taking on
9069517 by far the most dynamic age group growing food is the 28 to 38 year olds which is historically not a gardening age group i think that most people are aware that it takes so much oil and water to produce what theyre eating but the problem is inherent within the solution in so much as you dont want to tell people what to do but you do want to encourage enthuse and inform them
9069518 yes its on the cards due to being ill i put a stop to all work and officially i havent committed myself to anything but the danger is that by being on television you become part of the institution i like the idea of fifth columnists and subversion you dont stand on a podium with a loud hailer telling people what to do which the british absolutely hate youve got to somehow get under the skin of the system and make lots and lots of small changes
9069519 this terrifying disastrous evil has actually usurped and upset the whole system it makes you ask what were they doing right well they just bypassed they stepped aside theyre just not there you need to join together not delegate to a government body
9069520 my experience of working with government has not been fruitful i have to say im not aligned to any party although like many people i feel very disillusioned by the current government but dont feel very hopeful over any alternative power is not the right bit of kit to do this job its about going after the hearts and minds yes there will always be why should this wealthy tv wanker tell me what to do and its not a bad question why should i but i think youve just got to allow people to reject what you say
9069521 its an albatross organic is loaded with a sense of rightness with a set of rules i would much rather someone bought food that was local and sustainable but not organic than bought organic food that had to be shipped across the world weve got to move away from making people feel lesser because theyre not eating organic there is no doubt about it sustainable is a better expression for the same sorts of ideas than organic
9069522 you cant just say its bad because its bad plant breeding has been going on for millennia and its a gradual process at the moment i feel not nearly enough research is being done on the effects of gm and i have no faith at all in the goodwill of the producers and their motives but my overall feeling is that i would not discount anything
9069523 i do feel optimistic but i also feel that im 53 both my parents died in their sixties and youve got to leave this world in a better place that you find it youve got take the fuckers on and not just give in
9069524 once the trust is gone can it ever really be re established
9069525 this is the best performing british team since 1908 theyre the golden team
9069526 were looking for four or five deals worth around 400 000 each
9069527 could there be a 1m contract out there yes probably could it get to 2m in total id like to think so
9069528 i most want to get a kit deal so that i dont keep buying equipment for swimming
9069529 the smart athletes should wait for the dust to settle
9069530 brands are going to want to have a gold medallist in their portfolio in the run up to 2012
9069531 the whole point is that we want to take visa to as many people as possible the athletes can do that
9069532 theres a slight lessening of the sponsorship because of the sheer number of gold medals we won and the number of sportsmen and women involved
9069533 someone like christine because shes an olympic champion in athletics can earn up to 50 000 just for turning up to events
9069534 weve always been fascinated by real people and when we decided to do this show the first rule was instead of casting a comedian to play a car salesman wed just get a car salesman
9069535 a lot of people ask us where we find these bad actors and eccentric people but in hollywood theyre everywhere
9069536 your reason for liking it is different to their reason for doing it but you both get the same thing out of it
9069537 so we made a list of people we respected and sent them a dvd sort of out of desperation
9069538 adult swims philosophy is put it on the air and if it works great if it doesnt take it down and try again its a refreshing way to do tv i think
9069539 we pitched it to a bunch of other networks we went to mtv and they said
9069540 why not do a parody of like paris hiltons little dog
9069541 once wed made the first video we said oh well lets make 30 of these
9069542 we had lunch with those guys and it was like a reunion rather than a first meeting
9069543 were equally big fans of each other eric and i loved look around you
9069544 they create their own universe which is brilliant its not rude or offensive its just pointless and silly and colourful and noisy and throwaway
9069545 theyre hugely surreal and they push the boundaries in lots of different ways but theres a real heart to it as well its like theres a tube map of comedy and theyve started a whole new line
9069546 its exactly the kind of thing british tv companies cant see the point of because its unlikely to sell millions of dvds but im afraid id take tim amp eric over gavin amp stacey any day
9069547 i remember peter serafinowicz showed me their stuff and i thought it was awful but then i kept seeing bits online that were really extraordinary i have since spent hours tracking down everything i can find by them and there are very few people who inspire me in that way
9069548 i love them because their programmes are intricate and charming while also being stupid and repulsive
9069549 its the first time in years i have found something i feel selfish about
9069550 i dont know about you eric but ive never personally met someone who hated the show and told me about it
9069551 that guy in the star wars costume came up politely and said are you guys tim and eric and we were like yes and he said i hate your show so much then him and his klingon friend walked away it was funny
9069552 for a tiny child the mmr is a ridiculous thing to do it has definitely caused autism
9069553 too thick to get into a real uni come to edge hill university where we will ruin your life with a meaningless qualification rubbish social scene and low quality sex and drugs
9069554 my understanding was that it only applied to things that worked and we had not shown that we had a lot of work to do
9069555 i simply wouldnt have submitted a proposal or participated in the proposal
9069556 it certainly makes it a lot harder to attack the ticket in the types of ways that the republican ticket was going to be attacked
9069557 today on that third anniversary weve got to be thinking about the future
9069558 weve got to prepare in case this is another bad storm we pray it wont be
9069559 as we pray for the best were going to prepare for the worst
9069560 the blessing is if there is one its a three day weekend the storm is a long way off people have a lot of time
9069561 as we continue to monitor and prepare for the possibility of hurricane gustav i want all of our citizens to make certain they have a plan for leaving the trailers when advised to do so
9069562 you can build levees that are 100 feet high its not going to keep the rain out of the city a very very intense period of rain could flood the city because the pace of the rainfall could exceed the ability to pump out of the city
9069563 we evacuate we protect the integrity of the levees we continue to strengthen the levees thats part of a total system of really driving down the risk to the people of new orleans
9069564 you think thisll work that well leave hillary for her
9069565 but we feel weve addressed that issue through our recruiting and training in the offseason
9069566 when we were recruiting we targeted kelsey mainly because of her leadership abilities
9069567 it helps that she set on the 2006 youth national team too
9069568 we built our team based on defense and ball control
9069569 we are going to be making some big plays at the net this year
9069570 and many of our hitters can move to the outside middle or right side
9069571 i dont feel like the awards are putting pressure on me
9069572 but they do motivate me to work harder and get me excited to play
9069573 moving to thompson boling is great news for our fans
9069574 now they can enjoy volleyball without worrying about anything else
9069575 were working together as a team and having fun every time we step onto the court
9069576 hopefully our fans will see that and want to come
9069577 by the time we leave denver we should have a pretty good understanding of where we are as a team
9069578 one huge change in the sec this year is the fact that a lot of teams best players have graduated
9069579 itll be interesting to see whose young players can adapt the best
9069580 i really appreciate the opportunity to be able to play against anybody full force and to put a team out there with a chance at beating any team we come across
9069581 the sending off was unfortunate it was an instinctive thing and the fact he had been booked meant he had to go said a frustrated sir alex ferguson who refused to discuss the clubs interest in berbatov the tottenham striker although negotiations will continue this weekend
9069582 georgia and outmuscling them in the box to snatch a deserved lead when the menacing right boot of alejandro dominguez swept over a corner igor denisov outjumped patrice evra at the near post
9069583 our board said they spurs had seven weeks and they didnt offer the 22m euros they only offered 16m euros and arshavin should cost more than that
9069584 i have a contract with real madrid now but we are still negotiating with chelsea
9069585 he is staying in madrid and there is no possibility of going back on that
9069586 its normal for a player to say he wants to leave his club and when robinho did that i accepted it
9069587 i think hes making a mistake but thats his problem hes getting bad advice from his representatives but i trust the lad i think he has a lot of talent and can be a success here
9069588 robinho did what he was advised to do its as if he read the script they gave him and that was a mistake if he doesnt go he can carry on here perfectly well and change his attitude hes a great lad the coach says hes recoverable
9069589 its not my job to talk about the players i said something to peter a month ago and they try to bring the player here
9069590 hes one more important player quality velocity many things but i have very very good players here if he doesnt come he doesnt come i have players for that position no problem
9069591 thats normal all of the coaches in the world when they arrive assess the players
9069592 defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease
9069593 the last best hope of all who are called to the cause of freedom
9069594 let me spell out exactly what change would mean if i am president
9069595 for over two decades mr mccain has subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
9069596 what it really means is that youre on your own out of work tough luck youre on your own no healthcare the market will fix it youre on your own
9069597 what has been lost these past eight years cant just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits
9069598 what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose
9069599 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
9069600 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 per cent of the time
9069601 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
9069602 you cant truly stand up for georgia when youve strained our oldest alliances
9069603 if he makes it to the white house hell have an enormous mess to clean up if it doesnt go as smoothly as wed like to see then critics will say i told you so
9069604 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9069605 we welcome the recruitment of every new police officer but at this rate of progress it will take over 13 years for the snp to meet its manifesto commitment this simply isnt good enough when so many of our communities continue to live in fear of crime
9069606 labour and the liberal democrats are going to have to eat a big slice of humble pie now that police numbers have increased to record levels well over 100 above the position we inherited from them
9069607 shes exactly who i need shes exactly w advertisement ho this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9069608 i will be honoured to serve next to the next president of the united states
9069609 this is a moment when principle and political independence matter
9069610 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9069611 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need thats just more of the same
9069612 a small number of the necessary preparations for the event could not be completed in time
9069613 it comes as absolutely no surprise that members of the calman commission have had to cancel their trip to stirling because of lack of interest
9069614 not content with excluding the option of independence from their discussions the unionist parties have been determined to exclude the people from talks on their countrys future the commission has been nothing more than a group of politicians talking to each other behind closed doors
9069615 an enormous humiliation for the commission and added that the contrast with the
9069616 it has captured the imagination of people the length and breadth of scotland with more than 425 000 hits on the scottish government website while hundreds of members of the public packed out town halls to hear cabinet ministers at the recent events held around the country
9069617 the commission has a serious task ahead of it in exploring the experience of scottish devolution and it is determined to make sure its engagement programme and work is as effective as possible
9069618 how could this happen in europes oil capital a city full of millionaires
9069619 we had to keep it relatively simple and 40 40 20 roughly reflected the populations
9069620 the snp go on about how scotlands oil wealth should be for scotland but what about aberdeens oil wealth for aberdeen
9069621 there are far greater social problems there with deprivation poverty and unemployment than in glasgow and funding needs to reflect need
9069622 the fact is that we have always had the same funding level but managed to make the books balance and it suggests that something went very badly wrong when the liberal democrats took over
9069623 how they can push through a project like that when the city is facing a financial crisis is staggering
9069624 it should be cancelled and a different less expensive option considered
9069625 the fact is that our capital projects are spend to save projects if we stayed in st nicholas house we would have to spend the same money for something that may just last a decade if we are lucky
9069626 in the meantime we would have to find temporary accommodation for staff at further expense
9069627 the council taxpayers are now picking up the bill for those short term decisions
9069628 this is just a smokescreen to hide their own incompetence
9069629 it meant there was no direction or strategy and a lot of replication its probably cost the city millions
9069630 for years the squeeze has been put on councils and they have taken expedient measures such as cutting maintenance budgets
9069631 but now is there nothing more to squeeze and we have infrastructures that desperately need repair and replacing added to that we have a convergence of single status pay costs landfill pensions and many other things and councils are going to find it hard to cope
9069632 aberdeen was the least able to cope with all these factors for the simple reason that it is the worst funded that is why it was first to get into trouble this way
9069633 it is clear that in aberdeen there were particular circumstances coming from the fact that it was spending 10 million a year beyond its means
9069634 the health i have is down to the fact i swim and exercise i am convinced if i did not i would not feel as good as i feel
9069635 we may be able to come through this at the end but individuals concerned now will lose three years of training
9069636 i thought it was a pretty good effort for our first game
9069637 we have a good blend of old and new on this team and i thought we were solid for the most part the veterans have taken on more responsibility and the newcomers have given our program a jolt of fresh energy
9069638 turnovers hurt us a little bit in the middle third and thats something we have to clean up
9069639 it was kind of shocking to score that early in the game
9069640 demasters played a great ball into the box and i was in the right spot
9069641 aberdeen city council has one absolutely clear priority to achieve the budget savings which are needed to put this local authority back on an even keel elected members council officers and our external advisers are all working to that end
9069642 very productive meetings have been held with the external support group who can see that we have a clear plan of action for how we will make the necessary financial savings we really appreciate the help they have been able to give us and their adv
9069643 the leadership board is also working as a team with its entire focus on moving forward to achieve financial stability we are really pleased as is the external support group on the progress we have made so far
9069644 a huge amount of work has been done in the last few weeks
9069645 some of the specific savings are more challenging than others and once we have the work fully scoped may only be fully realised in 2009 10
9069646 contingency arrangements will be relied upon if needed in the immediate year our budget managers clearly understand that the savings have to be made and are working extremely hard to deliver them
9069647 there may come a time when we have to look back and address the issues of how we got to this position but that time is not now our collective effort must be to look ahead and move the council forward in a positive direction
9069648 thats a huge difference in coverage this time for the property owner compared with 2005 but its the world we live in these days
9069649 im a lumberjack and im ok i sleep all night and i work all day
9069650 i cut down trees i skip and jump i put on womens clothing and hang around in bars
9069651 from an investors perspective the biggest risk is when you have a big currency move in a single quarter
9069652 the risk is that a big change can create misses on the top line
9069653 tech companies have been benefiting from foreign exchange erosion in 22 of the past 25 quarters
9069654 for all intents and purposes currency has been a net gain for tech companies for the past six years
9069655 if not for dollar weakness in the first half of the year boosting m amp a transactions we could have seen a steeper slide in u s stocks
9069656 according to some of the league tables that i looked at we had approximately 190 deals with a total value of 200 billion
9069657 in the first and second quarter the earnings of u s corporations were boosted by positive currency translations the recovery in the dollar now strips away the foreign exchange contributions which could hurt earnings in the second half of the year
9069658 if the deal was done one year before that when the euro dollar was trading at 1 35 inbev would have probably had to pay another 9 billion
9069659 its certainly been easier when the dollars weaker for foreign companies to finance u s acquisitions
9069660 using inbev as an example though is their financing so razor thin that with a stronger dollar they couldnt do it in general my sense is that people are doing deals fist as strategic deals and then they figure out how to finance them and pay for them
9069661 i think that to the extent that a deal gets done it doesnt get done because youre saying that the currency makes it a great bargain
9069662 one thing to think about is that for most u s acquisitions folks tend to be financing locally
9069663 the equity slice will be coming out of their home country but when it comes to the actual purchase most folks would leverage to some extent and would often use a u s bank for that and service the debt out of cash flow of the purchased company
9069664 is mitigated somewhat if youre also borrowing in that currency
9069665 we still see european and british interest deals are still moving forward and it will be interesting to see what happens this winter
9069666 a major european acquirer told me in the spring that they were buying u s assets at a big discount they might still be doing this but its not as good for them as it was
9069667 i thought that the rank hypocrisy of this nomination would be called out by my favorite republican bloggers every one of obamas weaknesses as identified by conservatives and blasted for over a year are to be found in sarah palin people who have laughed at ridiculed and vilified barack obama for ages now turn around and apply absolutely none of the same attacks on palin than they have applied to obama

9069672 when we were down here 10 years ago or more we asked every black person we met about gullah and they didnt know what we were talking about
9069673 this is our legacy that hopefully is going to spread this is step one
9069674 ef oona ent know weh oona da gwine oona should kno weh oona come from
9069675 we think were the biggest thing since the union army marched into town
9069676 weve taken on a mission here the mission is to return the gullah people to financial independence
9069677 we knew our 40th cousin because we all lived together like tribes
9069678 our culture grew out of the west african culture a people who lived on a diet of rice rice rice
9069679 some people call us rice eating geechees if you talk funny and eat rice youre one of those
9069680 all us gullah people used to farm and work the creek
9069681 our cemeteries are always by the water because gullahs believe the spirit moves back to africa across the water
9069682 the only way to get off the island was by boat
9069683 i learned to understand my grandmother but i never could understand a word my aunt lucille said
9069684 you worship at the church of your mother you are buried beside your mother
9069685 they felt slaves should be educated so they could get along in a free society
9069686 oh lord i done done what you told me for do
9069687 he lived in wallace plantation our school bus would pass his house every day we thought he was crazy all his work was outside his house hed wave at us
9069688 there are no qualified women you just pick a woman to get hillary supporters
9069689 he would rather lose the election than lose the war
9069690 before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield illinois and one term in congress during which he showed courage and wisdom to oppose the invasion of another country in a war that was popular when it started but later condemned by history
9069691 the experience that lincolns supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9069692 he was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land
9069693 he insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity
9069694 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning
9069695 and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
9069696 barack obama had the experience and wisdom to oppose a popular war based on faulty premises
9069697 his leadership experience has given him a unique capacity to inspire hope in the promise of the american dream of a boundless future
9069698 his experience has also given him genuine respect for different views and humility in the face of complex realities that cannot be squeezed into the narrow compartments of ideology
9069699 his experience has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
9069700 as for the prospect of her being vice president palin told kudlow that she could not answer the question of whether she wanted the job

9069707 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9069708 nobody knew about his announcement this morning except a traveling aide and the governors chief of staff who found out about this last night
9069709 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9069710 im very sorry for terrible harm ive caused my children
9069711 i wish to humbly apologize to society for my crime i know human life is sacred and i took the life of a human being
9069712 i think republicans are more accustomed to following the rules
9069713 were used to sitting in the cheap seats weve got binoculars
9069714 while we cannot say this is the source of the outbreak we also cannot rule it out
9069715 we see the well results as one piece of the puzzle and its my understanding that they the restaurant were only on well water for two hours of one day
9069716 the british seem to like to laugh about their own stupidity in a funny way
9069717 during the performance when the london bus pulled over all the passengers waiting for the bus rushed into the door at the same time which truly damaged the british image
9069718 its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
9069719 they just dont have time to feel the joy of life
9069720 throughout the week they all work so hard they only talk to people at lunch break then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
9069721 i do accept that the money can create a distance between the working class and a working class player
9069722 thats what i think every time i tuck my children up at night
9069723 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine these are my heroes

9069741 when things used to go wrong the food was there
9069742 i would turn to it and it would make me feel better i have been trapped in a destructive cycle of binge and over eating all my life
9069743 it would be secretive i would eat in private all binge eaters do
9069744 it doesnt matter where you are as long as there is space to put the food in front of you and then just get the food down thats the most important thing
9069745 for breakfast i might have last nights take away i might have some cereal
9069746 then i will go and buy a big bar of chocolate before lunchtime
9069747 at lunchtime i might have a plate of food another takeaway or a sandwich
9069748 then id go and buy some more chocolate and then id have my evening meal
9069749 and then before i went to bed i would eat some more
9069750 it is fair to say that overeaters arent getting the support or attention that people with anorexia and bulimia receive
9069751 it is not seen as a eating disorder but it is and this is the battle that we are facing
9069752 the problem is that we just simply dont know how many people are suffering from bed binge eating disorder and compulsive overeating
9069753 last year beat received 88 000 calls from people who are suffering from eating disorders but we are concerned about people who arent contacting us
9069754 we know that people who are suffering from anorexia or bulimia are more likely to ask for help rather than people who overeaters
9069755 when we see someone is thin or has lost weight we tend to congratulate them saying you look good
9069756 however when we see someone who is overweight we think you are greedy you are lazy you have eaten too much
9069757 it wouldnt occur to many people that people who are overweight have disorders too they are compulsively overeating for many reasons psychological emotional many many reasons
9069758 they may use food as comfort to manage undesirable feelings
9069759 whatever feelings they are experiencing neglect sadness unhappiness food may soften and soothe that for a short while
9069760 the problem is that after the food is eaten those feelings are replaced with anger frustration as they tend to criticise and beat themselves up following an episode of overeating and that is how this destructive cycle happens
9069761 it wasnt explained to me at that point that i had a proper disorder
9069762 now things are different im a lot more accepting of who i am and im trying to get my eating under control and be a happier person
9069763 my advice would be to others in my situation to research all the options out there
9069764 i had success with the halliwick unit st anns hospital tottenham a specialist psychological therapy service
9069765 it is totally unacceptable that the highest cot death rate occurs in the most disadvantaged groups
9069766 we are urging all healthcare professionals to make sure that the known life saving advice reaches them
9069767 our study shows that pre term infants make incomplete or delayed recoveries from interruptions to breathing
9069768 it reinforces again the risk faced by babies of mothers who smoke
9069769 me gustan los desaf os importantes y espero poder rendir de la mejor manera para devolver la confianza que pusieron para traerme al club

9069771 we consider electric vehicles as one of the candidates for sustainable mobility but for the time being the most realistic approach is to use the electric vehicle for short distance travel
9069772 weve probably had 4 000 to 5 000 e mails
9069773 theres no way to measure the calls the only thing i can tell you about the calls is that from about 7 30 p m to about midnight that night the phone calls did not stop coming in
9069774 we have five or six phone lines and they were lit up the entire night
9069775 they were all using the same talking points that were sent out in the original obama e mail they were all the same boilerplate e mails
9069776 i got the feeling they were trying to intimidate us
9069777 i definitely think that directing the phone calls and the e mails of supporters was definitely an attempt not to shut us down but to intimidate us
9069778 tonight wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
9069779 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
9069780 they were trying to keep me from going on the air
9069781 the following day about noon when i got into the office that day i called the obama campaign let them know that we were going to be having stanley kurtz on the show and offered them a chance to come on the show as well to rebut anything that he said
9069782 we do one topic for the entire two hours and we offered the obama campaign a chance to be on for the entire two hours as well sort of a debate format if you will
9069783 the obama campaigns response was this guy is a liar if you want to talk about the annenberg challenge hes not the guy you want i cant believe that youre going to give this guy a forum
9069784 and i said thats why we want you on the air as well to give your side of the story so he asked who the program manager was on wgn so i told him and gave him the number thats when he hung up on me
9069785 which in my over 30 years experience with the program has never happened before
9069786 i am disgusted that wgn is giving two hours to a vicious racist crackpot i didnt know that ph ds from harvard turned out that way very often kurtz is tied to that vile traitor bill krystol spelled k r y s t o l why are you providing a platform to this character assassin
9069787 do you have a regulator like that fcc where i can file a complaint about the lack of balance since my understanding is that there is no opportunity for the obama campaign to present their correct version of events
9069788 the obama campaign accused me the previous night when i was on greta van susterens show on the fox news channel of telling a flat out lie in their words that obama got his job on the board of the annenberg challenge from ayers
9069789 we do have evidence that points in that direction that ayers must have had some involvement but we cant know it yet as a fact and i said that very clearly on the milt rosenberg show and when i was on greta i did not state it as a certain fact
9069790 each of them headed the two wings of this foundation for a number of years so they had to have some kind of working relationship ayers couldnt have been just a guy in my neighborhood as obama has claimed
9069791 thank you so much for your interview request it is now in our system and our communications team will follow up with you when we have a better idea of your requests status we understand the difficulties a delay in response may cause and certainly appreciate your patience
9069792 innovative approach to challenge the status quo and get results
9069793 it the blueprint for change is a laundry list of new government programs
9069794 its just a huge list i am pretty sure that everything is going to cost even more than he says it will and he has already promised to raise taxes
9069795 obama wants to pay for it by raising taxes but theres a real problem of affordability i dont know how much taxes would have to go up to pay for but it would certainly be a lot
9069796 infrastructure and education spending might bring us rewards five to 20 years down the road
9069797 energy is also a major economic issue right now and having a good energy policy is critical to our economic health in the future

9069827 high class lit magazine that also happens to be secretly sexy
9069828 it was one of the rare days with my putter i hadnt had in a while so it was fun
9069829 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9069830 it was just one of those days where i made a 15 footer on the first hole and then another one on the second hole i built on that momentum and just kept doing the same things keep the pedal down because i knew the scores were pretty low today
9069831 i missed four or five makeable putts four under is fine another round like that in the morning and ill be right in there
9069832 the par fives are reachable in two shots theres a short par four the rough is playable theres a bit of width off the tee and the greens roll good
9069833 whenever the greens roll true guys will make birdies there are plenty of train wrecks out there but plenty of birdies too this is the most enjoyable course weve played in a long time
9069834 i didnt play that well but i kept my score going
9069835 our citizens across the country may think that in fact there are no drugs in prison sadly that is not the case
9069836 over the next five years funds up to an amount of 120 million will go towards maintaining and putting in place a zero tolerance policy on drugs
9069837 we have brought up several of our concerns which we see incorporated in this
9069838 its good to see that they are actually taking the zero tolerance stance very seriously
9069839 were going to have a drug problem in prisons for as long as we persist in pursuing an unworkable drug control strategy outside prisons
9069840 its a fallacy to think that we can successfully make prisons drug free when 100 years of drug prohibition has not made canadian society drug free
9069841 the solution to the issue of prisoners and drugs lies outside the prison
9069842 we ask them to go away and take language courses and reapply
9069843 i would be one of the people that would say this is not morally correct
9069844 not speaking english does not exclude one from good manners does not exclude one from being a very good golf player so if youre really worried about rules and regulations theres definitely some other ways of getting around this
9069845 in essence any so called private club in b c which has a bona fide membership selection process in place is not covered by the human rights act and is permitted to discriminate on grounds that would otherwise be prohibited i e sex race religion etc
9069846 one of our mandates is to promote and grow the game and the best way to do that is to try and be as welcoming as possible
9069847 there isnt a legal remedy to this problem but i think that everyone has to acknowledge this is exclusionary and on its face discriminatory
9069848 one thing to recognize in canadas traditions now we recognize people come from all over the place and some people dont have the same kind of language skills as others and we try to accommodate people
9069849 we think it will be a choice between certainty and risk
9069850 love him or hate him our prime minister knows where he stands on the issues and will offer canadians certainty
9069851 were in rough waters and a steady hand at the wheel is what our economy needs
9069852 all of that is more risk and its more uncertainty around our economy
9069853 i think his plan is made he wants an election period
9069854 we are living in a pc world which is destroying us where you actually cant put the hard word on people when they have digressed and committed bad blunders
9069855 one of the advantages of being a farmer is that i was able to work with my children you can take them on the back of your motorbike which youre not supposed to do any more you can take them on your horse which youre not supposed to do any more
9069856 in the evenings we went to the rugby parties with the kids who slept in the back of the car we cant do that any more because we havent got rid of the perpetrators that actually destroy our society
9069857 the one thing i believe is important in life is respect they respected authority they respected teachers i respected the teachers we lack a great deal of respect for authority nowadays theres always someone protesting
9069858 respect and role models are very important in life you as a father with the aid of your partner i cant say wife these days pc you are the one who sets the ground rules and dont ever tell me that the kids dont want to know where the line is they do

9069873 the republican presidential candidate john mccain has finally chosen his running mate its governor sarah palin heres what she had to say on the last of july this year about a possible bid for the vice presidency
9069874 i tell you i cant answer that question until somebody answers to me what is it exactly that the vp does every day
9069875 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9069876 it just felt normal just one of those days where i made about a 15 footer on the first hole another on the second hole i just kind of built on that momentum
9069877 i just tried to keep the pedal down because i knew the scores were pretty low
9069878 its been kind of my goal the last moth or so to get off to better starts in tournaments
9069879 it seems like ive been having to come from behind ive just put it in my to try to get off to a better start obviously this was way exceeding my expectations
9069880 its nuts i dont think theyve got it right quite yet
9069881 how can you have a double major winner not make the tour championship thats complete nonsense
9069882 it was one of the rare days it did feel like that

9069886 its not for everyone people buy multiple tickets all the time
9069887 this is another game with hype and enticement with a 30 dollar ticket it just adds another dimension to the billions of dollars that are being wagered every year the demographic studies show that overwhelmingly the people who participate are of the lower to mid income categories the people who can least afford to lose money
9069888 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all

9069896 i found it when i was looking for something else
9069897 this important bill creates an environment in which testing will become routine and more californians will know their hiv status get linked to care as needed and have an overall better quality of life studies have shown that when individuals know their hiv status those found to be positive take steps to decrease the risk of passing their hiv infections on to others ab 1894 is a straightforward solution to a growing public health dilemma it helps pave the way to encourage widespread and routine hiv testing throughout california something the cdc first recommended nationwide nearly two years ago it is prudent legislation that will save lives
9069898 ab 1894 provides an ideal opportunity to break the chain of new infections by compelling insurers operating in california to cover the cost of routine hiv testing in medical and health settings like ers and community clinics
9069899 as with any disease the most effective public health strategy to combat hiv aids is to identify those who are infected provide treatment and minimize the spread of new infections ab 1894 will help us identify more people who are already living with hiv but who may not know their status because theyve never been tested hiv is a treatable but not curable infection with the lifetime cost of care for just one individual living with hiv aids now estimated at more than 600 000 we need to do everything possible to normalize the process for hiv testing in order to identify all those who are infected link them to treatment and reduce the spread of new infections

9069903 we do have generators and hurricane information in all the rooms and we have the availability to make updates and announcements
9069904 being on the ballot in november thats significant to me because i believe that will bring out our conservative voters
9069905 the fact that shes a woman is irrelevant to me her policy and what she has done thats whats important to me
9069906 theres really a opportunity to bring over those moderate female voters we look at polling numbers and barack obama hasnt been able to close the gap with hillary clinton supporters
9069907 before designing and printing your business card you may want to know the reasons that clients retain them
9069908 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
9069909 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
9069910 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
9069911 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
9069912 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9069913 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of senator obama
9069914 the fact remains obama is still not ready to be president
9069915 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
9069916 has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
9069917 who can best help me shake up washington and make it start working again for the people who are counting on us
9069918 exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help us fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9069919 i sent a notarized letter to the fener greek patriarchate to remind them of this i want to make it clear that i respect all religious minorities in turkey and their religions
9069920 it was an expected speech as hard liners were heavily represented in the ceremony
9069921 it just needs time because the army is a large bureaucratic organization
9069922 secularism means indifference to all lifestyles but we cannot say we have fully digested full democratic values
9069923 the general has given domestic messages instead of focusing on emerging threats in the region
9069924 instead of criticizing postmodernism and globalization ba bu should have focused on a speech that will address threats and dangers emerging around the borders of the country and explain the military preparedness capacity and power to respond to those challenges the army should return to its main obligation which is defending the country
9069925 a segment of the society thinks that religion is given a great weight in an emerging new cultural identity and lifestyle and is worried about this development
9069926 this concern should be taken seriously this is compulsory for social peace within the scope of a pluralistic democracy
9069927 the general explained the armys reservations when it comes to the european union accession talks though the army accepts the eu membership as an ultimate result it thinks the legal regulations and harmonization laws prevent the military from waging an effective war against terror elements with the speech the army has clarified that they really do not want to be a member of the european union
9069928 the generals remarks on the nation state indicate to me that he is narrow minded and the military cannot grasp the importance of turkeys position on the global stage
9069929 ethnic diversity has become a threat to national unity and security as a result of transnational social and cultural movements
9069930 the nation state considered the greatest obstacle to globalization is trying to be removed through economic control and micro ethnic provocations
9069931 the tsk has always defended and will continue to defend the nation state the unitary state and the laic state
9069932 this is a decision that the president of turkey will make
9069933 g l should not go there because there will be provocation and chaos if he goes no one will be welcoming if g l agrees to visit
9069934 if this is the case then he should go in fact our president ilham aliyev should also join foreign mediators have been trying to find a solution for 17 years but nothing happens we have to solve this ourselves
9069935 g l should not go to armenia because it is a hostile country
9069936 if its an enemy of azerbaijan then its also an enemy of turkey because we as our politicians say are one nation with two states
9069937 political issues should be taken up and the nagorno karabakh issue should definitely be discussed
9069938 this is why there is a greater need for closer ties between turkey and the european union
9069939 of course there are conditions to be met for this but turkey should become a part of europe
9069940 the eu would be acting wisely if it included turkey in its strategies
9069941 the mkek factory in k r kkale is turkeys only military gunpowder factory there had been other explosions in the factory in the past but the necessary safety precautions were taken after that
9069942 we are not against demolition in our neighborhood but it is not normal for the electricity to be cut for eight days at a time when ramadan is approaching weve prepared so much food for ramadan it will go to waste if we dont have electricity to run our refrigerators
9069943 how can we feel safe at night if we have no electricity burglars will threaten our lives during this period
9069944 my only wish is to be a good and useful person for my country and for our people through the profession i take may god bless those who gave us this opportunity
9069945 we hope that reason will prevail over emotions that eu leaders will find the courage to refrain from a one sided assessment of the conflict

9069948 sezon rice does not see any reason to justify price increase speculations and markups as there is a recession in the market
9069949 if some people try to hike rice prices they will end up with disappointing sales figures as there is a decrease in the market demand
9069950 almost 430 millions tons of rice are produced in the world
9069951 when rice is compared to other food items it is priced relatively lower but perceptions differ from this reality
9069952 and whats more rice is not a vital food in the turkish kitchen
9069953 you will be awake and aware of whats happening because its local anaesthetics
9069954 errr during the biopsy we will be very careful not to damage a nerve the accessory nerve that may give you a stiff shoulder but sometimes the nerve can be bruised and you may want to rest a few days
9069955 but if i dont feel any stiff shoulder after the procedure i can drive right
9069956 11 40 a m obama reaction the timess jeff zeleny has the following dispatch the obama campaign had no immediate response to reports that senator john mccain has selected the little known alaska governor sarah palin as his running mate neither mr obama nor mr biden talked to reporters but mr biden could be seen wearing a wide smile in the front cabin of the plane ms palin came as a surprise not only to many republicans and journalists but also to the obama team the campaign has been busily preparing tv commercials to run against mitt romney with aides gleefully watching hours of footage of romney mccain exchanges from the primary but far little opposition research had been prepared about the alaska governor and aides said no commercials were ready to be immediately released which the mccain campaign did when mr biden was chosen
9069957 i think that uh you know campaigns start getting these uh hair triggers and uh the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9069958 i want them to have the same opportunities as your sons
9069959 my campaign staff is not the staff i thought i knew
9069960 the obama campaign was not prepared for the palin announcement a choice that was unexpected but not totally off the radar thats not good in politics but its very discouraging in governing in fact it makes the obama campaign sound as clueless as it often describes the bush administration
9069961 inky99 is actually a rovian agent and has carnal knowledge of goats
9069962 theres also this issue that on april 18th she gave birth to a baby with downs syndrome children with downs syndrome require an awful lot of attention the role of vice president it seems to me would take up an awful lot of her time and it raises the issue of how much time will she have to dedicate to her newborn child
9069963 islam isnt in america to be equal to any other faiths but to become dominant the koran the muslim book of scripture should be the highest authority in america and islam the only accepted religion on earth
9069964 we are not fighting so that you will offer us something we are fighting to eliminate you
9069965 first chase out the invaders from our territory in palestine in iraq and everywhere in islamic land
9069966 second instal sharia islamic law on the entire earth and spread islamic justice there the attacks will not cease until after the victory of islam and the setting up of sharia

9069968 i was expecting five sets i was there for four and five but he wasnt there anymore
9069969 he is the biggest player for sure nadal is playing good tennis this year but for me federer is the best one
9069970 i dont think its affected a whole lot of matches i dont know how many times its saved a match because thats what its there for really but at the big tournaments at the big courts usually you have the best linespeople as well
9069971 the worst linespeople are usually on the outside courts where you need it more thats the problem with the system
9069972 as long as im doing the splits that means im healthy
9069973 when im not doing the splits you know theres something wrong
9069974 im not too sure about my body if i go into a split who knows if ill come back up
9069975 i wish i didnt have any drama in my matches i wish i would win nice and in a simple way
9069976 who likes drama do you know anybody that likes to get involved into tight matches
9069977 when you say wind solar and tide most every expert that i know says that if you maximize that in every possible way the contribution that that would make given the present state of technology is very small is very small its not a large contribution its wonderful its great to have it i encourage it everywhere i hope everyone will for christmas buy their family a solar panel but that would be exciting but they but id be glad to send you the figures that theres the amount of even if we gave it the absolute maximum uh wind solar and tide uh etc the clean tech the truly clean technologies dont work
9069978 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency

9069982 you cant get much better than joe biden hes a good man
9069983 obama gave a great speech of course i wanted a woman i would have liked to see hillary be the candidate
9069984 he was able to get specific and attack his opponent but in a very careful way
9069985 a day to remember the disastrously inadequate response from the federal government and pledge that never again will we let bureaucratic incompetence leave disaster victims stranded and alone
9069986 the fact that the race seems so close may very well throw north carolina to the obama camp which i find astonishing
9069987 theres some feeling that barr might impact mccain the x factor is that mccain has not fully brought to the base his genuine conservative credentials
9069988 liberals who are tired of the democratic party acting as a doormat to the governments assault against civil liberties
9069989 and conservatives who are tired of the republican partys reckless abandonment of fiscal responsibility are all potential barr voters
9069990 thats one of the reasons people are so hostile to nader
9069991 its clear that ralph nader could again have a significant impact on the presidential race though in highly unpredictable ways
9069992 do you seriously want me to pay you for services rendered 4 years ago
