2210000 i dont know what it is but i hope it continues
2210001 lance swung it well tejada swung it well carlos continues to do what he does and drive in runs and hunter got the big homer for us ty wigginton even swung it well and had a home run taken away
2210002 this is a place where ive had success in the past so you always have a level of comfort when youve done well in a place
2210003 i dont try to read too much into it i dont look at the schedule and say oh were going to cincinnati im going to get a bunch of hits you just get a good feeling when you go to certain places and this is one of the places i enjoy playing
2210004 i got out of the first inning and started cruising pretty good
2210005 i threw a lot of pitches in the first and it seemed like after we scored a few runs they started swinging early it helped me stay in the game a little longer
2210006 every time roy takes the mound even before you get a 5 0 lead you have a
2210007 in this ballpark one swing can kind of change things and we saw that in the eighth inning
2210008 he took us deep into the game and it looked like he had his good fastball and breaking ball he was sharp i just didnt like to see the way it ended up in the ninth inning
2210009 the squeaky wheel gets the grease and she knows it
2210010 sangat menyenangkan bermain dalam tim dengan dukungan 90 ribu lebih penonton
2210011 in five years of work on this issue this is probably the most important vote the legislature has ever taken
2210012 we are grateful to our local representatives and senators for their continued leadership in protecting buzzards bay from future oil spills
2210013 but those are towns we have looked at as models
2210014 in a few years it absolutely could be like those places here
2210015 kami berharap akan menemui musim yang menyenangkan setelah kerja sama spektakuler ini
2210016 secularism and materialism are likely to grow in significance in an increasingly competitive inter connected world reflecting trends that are already well established in the more developed regions meanwhile cultural mixing the pace of change and a rapid confluence of modern ideas and traditional values are likely to increase the trend towards moral relativism and increasingly pragmatic values these developments will trigger responses from complex traditionally defined communities as well as among significant minorities whic will seek the sanctuary provided by more rigid belief systems including religious orthodoxy and doctrinaire political ideologies such as popularism and marxism
2210017 the us geological survey estimates that around 25 of the remaining global oil and gas reserves are likely to be located in the arctic although the harsh climate and environmental restrictions currently militate against oil exploration and production in this region arctic warming is likely to be double the global average and this will significantly improve prospects for future exploitation petrochemical companies aggressively developing new extraction technologies are likely to pursue oil production undeterred by current environmental limitations constraints and concerns the annual reduction in arctic ice coverage is likely to continue leading to the prospect of a year round northern sea route across the arctic ocean between continents and may culminate in a summer ice free arctic in the period 2040 to 2080 these routes will become strategically significant offering shorter and more direct trade links between north america europe and asia
2210018 russias significance and influence in europe is likely to increase reflecting its extensive natural resources particularly in oil and gas but its ability to exert direct leverage or leadership will be limited by its internal tensions not least its acute demographic crisis threats to stability from radical islam and severe regional instability on its southern periphery the failure of russia to diversify its economy from a single sector based on energy as a saudi arabia of the north may result in stunted economic development and huge inequalities resulting in political stasis and the potential for instability and disorder this tendency will be perpetuated by ongoing difficulties in generating a self sustaining middle class significant levels of civic responsibility and a socio economic model based on the rule of law a failure to overcome these problems is likely given historic experience to result in an increasingly authoritarian overtly nationalistic posture characterized by a highly regulated but irregular and criminalized economic sector and poor democratic credentials
2210019 both the newsagency and doms have surveillance and we will be viewing the tapes
2210020 we were notified and were there in around five minutes
2210021 the first time they smashed the front window and the alarm went off
2210022 the second time they pushed the whole front door in and the frame
2210023 this week they smashed the front window with a brick
2210024 we had close to 5 000 in stock in the window and there are glass fragments in everything including a white cabinet a one off from dubai
2210025 they just went along the street smashing its also an inconvenience we were there at midnight barring the window
2210026 the brand new state of the art four bed donor vehicle will come into service in 2009 and i urge country communities to put their case forward for a spot on the blood donor service program
2210027 over the next few months the arcbs expects to be contacting local communities about potential new collection venues
2210028 i first raised this issue in parliament with health minister jim mcginty when the mobile collection service was forced to close down in july 2005 and he agreed then to re investigate options for the service
2210029 the service had visited narrogin and northam annually up until then and country people really
2210030 i am especially grateful to local community groups and individuals who assisted me during the lobby campaign and they have a major role in achieving the desired outcome
2210031 we basically filed a brief that says if you injure someone in houston texas you should properly be held accountable in houston
2210032 mcnamee slandered roger in houston and thats where the injury occurred
2210033 theyre trying to get a federal judge in houston to say that proper jurisdiction for suing mcnamee is in new york
2210034 its sort of the legal equivalent of dont mess with texas
2210035 hes spending most of his time following kobys career and following his kids
2210036 we are very fortunate to be able to appoint a well known local person to this position
2210037 we have many different groups organisations and people with varying interests in our community and it is important that all are represented and given a voice
2210038 at the end of the day it is a community paper so it needs to be fed by the community we are just really here to facilitate that
2210039 the atmosphere was indescribable between the bright colourful bags we all wore to the flags of countries enthusiastically waved
2210040 every group seemed to have a chant for their country and our god and while it was easy to be pushed over in the sometimes shoulder to shoulder crowds it was also easier to gain a few thousand hugs from the pilgrims standing along the roads with homemade signs saying free hugs
2210041 these events werent just amazing for what they were it was being in the presence of thousands laughing praising and praying to our lord
2210042 on one occasion a group of young people began singing the wyd theme song from beginning to end
2210043 on concluding the singers introduced themselves realising that none of them knew each other and that they were from several different countries
2210044 swapping flags was a popular craze and even if you didnt have anything to swap you were still given gifts from other pilgrims
2210045 we were blessed to meet people from all walks of life and all corners of the world including former motor mission nun sister maree who now lives in papua new guinea she spoke fondly of her years in wagin in the 1970s
2210046 there were people with disabilities from mental handicaps to the hearing impaired to blind and people dependent on wheelchairs and crutches
2210047 these people never stopped at anything with some even journeying on crutches the 10km walk to randwick for the final vigil and mass
2210048 seeing pope benedict xv1 who continues in the footsteps of st peter was a highlight for all at his arrival and at the mass shouts of il viva papa could be heard everywhere
2210049 there was even a new version of the favourite aussie aussie aussie oy oy oy which used the word bennie bennie instead
2210050 but it was the popes words presence and gentle humility that touched so many to be in the presence of the leader of the church was inspiring
2210051 it felt as though the people we met were lifelong friends
2210052 each of us came back tired and exhausted but with the holy spirit within us and our facebook list of friends reaching a point of explosion
2210053 they stand there amp yak away amp pat each other on the back amp most all of them have chin whiskers
2210054 but as an enemy combatant he then becomes eligible for the annual review board process to determine whether hes eligible for release or transfer
2210055 i thought i had made it clear but he goes i didnt see it that way
2210056 a minimum wage is helpful in the fight against poverty
2210057 minimum wage increases 1988 2003 did not affect poverty rates overall or among the working poor or among single mothers
2210058 the coin must have been done by a professional the work is impressive

2210062 can include david the existing eccentric lord of the manor physically as well to a suitable purchaser
2210063 we are very proud of our beautiful city and we had to find a day to celebrate it
2210064 im feeling excited and happy as our childs birthday is the same as for the opening ceremony for the games
2210065 i wish for a prosperous and stronger china and also wish for good performance by our athletes
2210066 if the baby is born on the day the whole world is celebrating it will surely be lucky but as long as the baby has good health it is a lucky enough day for the family
2210067 the number of applications is many times that of normal days
2210068 hes done a good job were six games over 500 since he took over weve got a long way to go offensively but hes really laid the groundwork for some of the right stuff offensively the guys like playing for him
2210069 president ilves will be in france from august 10 16 he will not have any official meetings

2210121 there is still a stigma surrounding people with an intellectual disability but continued education about the disability and their presence in the community will hopefully overcome it
2210122 we tell our children when things get tough hang onto gods hand and never let go and he will see you through
2210123 i recall some of the team could not even catch a ball
2210124 i said to him tongue in cheek that i hoped his bloody plane dropped out of the sky i was so angry
2210125 for the first time in many years we recently went out together just the two of us
2210126 all we told him was tell the truth and cooperate
2210127 for us the most important thing is that our client is properly represented and we understand that with time everything will be solved
2210128 he still came into the gym and practiced his shot
2210129 im not going to say there was no way in the world they could have done that
2210130 but i dont think so i didnt see anything like that
2210131 it was one of the last names i would have expected to see
2210132 seriously one person cannot change the outcome of a game
2210133 if found guilty it would affect his eligibility to play in puerto rico

2210135 we understand that everyone is presumed innocent and we will wait until the evidence is presented
2210136 ich konnte dem bundestrainer keine garantie mehr geben dass ich ber das eine jahr hinaus f r das ich beim vfb stuttgart einen vertrag habe noch fu ball spielen werde insofern habe ich ihm und andreas k pke vorgeschlagen dass sie f r die deutsche nationalmannschaft nicht mehr mit mir planen
2210137 ich habe mich bei jens f r gro artige leistungen in der nationalmannschaft bedankt ich habe bisher nur wenige spieler kennengelernt die so positiv und pr gnant ihre erfahrung eingebracht haben um gemeinsam alles f r den erfolg zu geben

2210140 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2210141 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2210142 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2210143 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2210144 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2210145 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2210146 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2210147 every time they do that they are showing an implicit trust in whoever wrote the application and most people dont know who that is
2210148 social networks really dont care if you get pawned or not
2210149 people know if they go on a computer and download a program they could get a virus they dont have the same view of how dangerous that can be on a social networking site
2210150 once the content is moved from their site they have no control over that

2210153 i wanted the kids to be creative and steered them away from doing posters
2210154 i did have high expectations when georgia told me she wanted to make a quilt
2210155 it is probably the best project i have ever seen
2210156 stop copying 2001 windows thats not where the usability action is
2210157 theres got to be more ive got this lingering feeling that open source has not done enough
2210158 we want to work with open source to get a toehold there
2210159 we are protesting about the lack of progress we are frustrated that negotiations are going nowhere
2210160 the feeling is strong among members and they dont like striking but they are really concerned about the impact the funding model will have on pirie schools
2210161 we came to support the teachers and let them know we think they are great
2210162 we are asking mr kerin to put pressure on the rann govern ment and present this letter signed by members to parliament
2210163 the rann government needs to get on with it and sort it out
2210164 they need to settle the salary issue and make a decent offer
2210165 normally a peak period in the us but because of the state of the economy people are staying home
2210166 much closer to 1 50 than they are to 1 60
2210167 we are starting to see those lower prices flow through to regional south australia
2210168 it is about the kids having a go and getting involved
2210169 we have some john pirie students umpiring as well so it is a day for students from the whole city to be involved
2210170 we have fun the whole day and it is better than going to school
2210171 i think i have been playing all right today and our team is probably the toughest to play against
2210172 the boys forgot to put the basket out for nikki to come out of but we improvised and i think everyone understood what was going on
2210173 wir h tten die er ffnungsfeier gerne viel sp ter gehabt
2210174 ich folge der denkweise der regierung nicht ich hoffe dass ich die kinder hier inspirieren kann ihren tr umen zu folgen und die h rden zu meistern
2210175 wir hielten es f r wichtig unseren sportlern einen ort anzubieten an dem sie sich wie sonst auch vorbereiten und mit freiem kopf bestleistungen abrufen k nnen
2210176 es wird ein kopf an kopf rennen werden zwischen china uns und russland
2210177 nun haben wir wirklich keine entschuldigung daf r nicht gold zu gewinnen
2210178 das klima ist extrem ich hoffe dass es nicht gar so schlimm wird aber in meinen schlimmsten alptr umen hatte ich es so bef rchtet
2210179 es ist schon heftiger hier als anderswo da hilft nur viel trinken
2210180 ich gehe davon aus dass wir eine reihe von infekten und atemwegserkrankungen haben werden

2210182 my husband works for a computer company and sometimes he gets sent out of town for six or eight weeks at a time i usually go with him we went to jacksonville florida and stayed in this cool condo one day i was super horny so when he got home i told him i wanted to screw out on the balcony we decided that if we were going to screw on the balcony in the daylight it would be an ideal spot for me to pose for nn as well
2210183 these guys they just came up to me and offered me a ride so i told them okay when we were in the car one of the cute guys pulled out his dick it was so big i started drooling
2210184 in the current study we focused on preexisting psychiatric risk factors for postpartum suicide attempts resulting in hospitalization most importantly a prior psychiatric or substance use diagnosis among postpartum women significantly increased the risk of a serious postpartum suicide attempt
2210185 one implication of this study is that screening for past history of psychiatric and substance use diagnoses as part of routine prenatal care may be a means of identifying women at high risk of postpartum suicide attempt although a recent review of prenatal screening for depression cited insufficient evidence to recommend screening as a way to improve outcomes
2210186 this work helps connect our psychological understanding of why we like some things and not others with the genetic mechanisms that define our range of behaviors
2210187 in the ongoing discussion about how much the environment versus genetics determine behavior this study points to how the interaction between these factors influences our judgment and decision making
2210188 we were surprised to see that variation in the creb1 gene would account for more than 20 percent of the difference in how healthy participants weighed different options and expressed specific preferences
2210189 our previous studies and the work of other groups suggested that variation in this gene could be important for judgment and decision making by the brain but we needed to connect this to a measurable decision making effect in both behavior and brain activity
2210190 this will exclude any areas that have been re zoned lower density or if rural living has been identified as a suitable area for re zoning into hobby farms
2210191 its unlikely too many people will want a hobby farm of 100h unless they want to use it for traditional agriculture
2210192 the growing trend towards the breaking up of high rainfall farming lands for large scale lifestyle blocks where the wealthy build homes and run four or five horses until the children grow up and go to university
2210193 we have lost horticultural lands in the sydney basin banana plantations at coffs harbour and large dairy holdings around taree in nsw its also happened from kilmore to melbourne in victoria
2210194 if the trend continues were in danger of losing the ground we produce food on
2210195 our findings have long term implications for how we teach negotiation
2210196 likely to add fuel to a debate about how to better identify and treat maternal mood disorders and whether widespread systemic screening is warranted
2210197 only kidd kraddick can make racism so interestingly funny i cant believe they pulled it off
2210198 people want to know how people make decisions whether its how you drive your car or whether to invest in a mortgage its important to understand when and how we make those decisions to understand the type of errors people are prone to make
2210199 what we have found is that people make decisions based on what option appears to be better most of the time under conditions in the natural world this would be the best strategy but in modern life it has nothing do with the real inherent risks
2210200 you save one minute but you can lose everything people dont do the math
2210201 weve evolved to be afraid of snakes but not traffic lights
2210202 if you give feedback and rewards to employees in a clear way they might be more willing to take risks on your behalf
2210203 the findings in this study may be considered encouraging in many ways the average amount of alcohol has decreased in more recently born cohorts the percentage of the population exhibiting moderate alcohol intake has been increasing steadily and the percentage reporting heavy drinking has decreased over time

2210226 council chose to open the capsule as part of local government week
2210227 it has been down 20 odd years and we wanted to check on the condition of material there and add information on events that have happened since that time

2210231 we are microfilming a lot of it and we will keep the original documents in a properly controlled room

2210249 if network operators cant manage traffic loads one way theyll do it another by banning discrimination based on application or content the fcc and net neutrality proponents more broadly are pushing network operators closer and closer to what increasingly is their only viable alternative usage based pricing

2210252 these assertions are simply untrue by stirring up fears of higher monthly bills this posturing attempts to delegitimize the commissions worthy action giving consumers the false impression that they must choose between secret internet blocking or the very undesirable practice of metering
2210253 this is a false choice one most providers dont even consider necessary or practical these scare tactics shouldnt deter anyone from pursuing the policies we need to preserve a free and open internet
2210254 but to believe such a move is right around the corner we must accept the argument that there is congestion in the network
2210255 predicting the internets catastrophic collapse and ghost sites galore in 1996
2210256 almost all of the many predictions now being made about 1996 hinge on the internets continuing exponential growth but i predict the internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse

2210258 isps may well buck the historical trends and economic incentives and move forward with limitation pricing anyway

2210283 in minneapolis when you see the somalian community its clear the lack of representation in the media that was the thing i most thought about when i was there i saw something was missing so id come home and write which started me down this path
2210284 i couldve just been the good entertainer and everybody would have been happy but i had to say something how many kids who came from where i did the streets of mogadishu would ever get that kind of chance

2210298 when a creditors garnishment order is enforced and these federal funds withheld the lives of a vulnerable segment of the population are placed at risk
2210299 we need our banking regulatory agencies to start enforcing the law

2210308 isnt it time that he and our brethren on the city council costa mesa start enforcing the citys ordinances regarding fourth of july fireworks before he mayor mansoor attempts to shamelessly hunt down illegal immigrants who care for our children cut our lawns maintain the city golf courses and work in the kitchens in most ever restaurant in our city
2210309 and those rednecks that are out there making decisions for the betterment of their community will think twice before they push forward anti immigrant legislation against our community you can be a chicano nationalist you can be as revolutionary as you want you can believe in the concept of atzlan we dont have to give our lives we are not at that point
2210310 mansoor mayor of costa mesa california is a expletive racist pig
2210311 we can not keep up with the drug smuggling by aliens that come across the border through public parks on a daily basis
2210312 you are sitting in a city riverside that used to be part of mexico that gives us a sense of entitlement this was our land
2210313 we are immigrants free to travel the length and breadth of the americas we belong here we are millions we have an ageing white america they are not having babies they are dieing its a matter of time
2210314 say what you will but it dosent get much better than that
2210315 we native american indians are offended and appalled by hispanic immigrants who attempt to erase the history of our indigenous native people and replace it with a pack of lies about some mexican history that in fact never existed

2210320 i guess their tonantzin collective support of illegal immigration includes sex offenders illegal immigrants that were arrested by immigration and customs enforcement in costa mesa
2210321 whats happening across our nation certainly shows how concerned people are about illegal immigration

2210323 no time for hope a city council because the angry shouting match over mayor mansoors plan to federalize the costa mesa police
2210324 mansoor and his string of puppets will not be happy untill we are one big
2210325 mansoor mayor of costa mesa seemly would have us go back to the days following pearl harbor only this time instead of rounding up hard working japanese people he and his xenophobic comrades would be arresting hardworking latinos
2210326 they return to reason group have yet to show us any of their
2210327 any reason for an abortion is enough cause to have one
2210328 those that believe dana rohrabacher r is truthful probably believe there is no racism involved in the costa mesa city council decision to shut down the job center for illegal aliens
2210329 people need to be aware that some very bad actors are coming across our border
2210330 all data and analysis associated with a published paper should be available this seems an unarguable basic standard but is one that we currently fall far short of
2210331 raw research data should be made freely available to all researchers publishers encourage the public posting of the raw data outputs of research sets or sub sets of data that are submitted with a paper to a journal should wherever possible be made freely accessible to other scholars
2210332 by multiplying the number of financial services shares sold by the initial share price at which the number of financial services shares are sold in connection with the initial public offering
2210333 cannot be obtained by any purchase separate from an insurance contract issued by sun life
2210334 n o gain or loss will be recognized by the eligible policyholders on the deemed exchange of their ownership rights solely for company stock
2210335 basis of the company stock deemed received by the eligible policyholders in the exchange will be the same as the basis of the ownership rights surrendered in exchange for such company stock
2210336 t he gain from the sale or other disposition of property shall be the excess of the amount realized therefrom over the adjusted basis provided in section 1011 for determining gain
2210337 to realize a gain or loss in the value of property the taxpayer must engage in a sale or other disposition of the property
2210338 where property is acquired for a lump sum and interests therein are subsequently disposed of separately in order to compute the gain or loss from each disposition an allocation or apportionment of the cost or other basis to the several units must be made
2210339 this regulation tells us that when property is acquired in a lump sum purchase but then divided and sold off in parts the cost basis of the property should generally be allocated over the several parts
2210340 only in rare and extraordinary cases will property be considered to have no fair market value
2210341 complete or close a transaction from which income may be realized
2210342 received as a bonus with the purchase of preferred stock or bonds
2210343 if that should be impracticable in any case no profit on any subsequent sale of any part of the stock or securities will be realized until out of the proceeds of sales shall have been recovered the total cost
2210344 no profit on any subsequent sale of any part of the property received in exchange is realized until out of the proceeds of sale shall have been recovered the entire cost of the original property
2210345 so indefinite that it can not be applied with accuracy nor consistency
2210346 s ome valuation speculative or otherwise was necessary in order to close the estate it may never yield as much it may yield more
2210347 in some instances apportionment of the amount of a single purchase price to several items purchased for that single total price may be had
2210348 not a proper case for such an apportionment since it would not be practicable here
2210349 no particular value could be assigned to the interest in the security company represented by the indorsement on the bank stock as of the date of the purchase of the bank stock with any degree of assurance that that assignment of value was correct or even approximately so
2210350 an attempt here to attribute a certain value to the interests in the security company acquired by plaintiffs testator involves us largely in guess work
2210351 we do not think that the situation calls for such a rough estimate when by patience the exact answer may be obtained
2210352 the commissioner acted within his powers in refusing to permit the deduction
2210353 a pportionment with reasonable accuracy of the amount received not being possible and this amount being less than petitioners cost basis for the property it can not be determined that petitioner has in fact realized gain in any amount
2210354 a pplying the rule no portion of the payment in question should be considered as income but the full amount must be treated as a return of capital and applied in reduction of petitioners cost basis
2210355 n ormally when a taxpayer acquires an aggregate of assets for a single purchase price on subsequent sale of any portion he must allocate a part of the price he originally paid to the portion being sold on the basis of its proportionate value at the time of purchase so that gain or loss on the partial sale can be determined
2210356 where at the time of the acquisition of the aggregation there was no separate market for the different parts of the aggregate rational apportionment of the purchase price between the several elements purchased cannot be made
2210357 if the regulation enunciates a sound rule as unquestionably it does a similar principle ought to govern analogous situations where the price paid for a bundle of assets cannot be allocated among them on a rational basis
2210358 i t is wholly impracticable to make such an allocation of the purchase price proper tax treatment would be to treat the cash disbursement upon liquidation in 1939 as a return of capital going to reduced basis and to recognize no loss until the last part of the package the guaranty was sold in 1944
2210359 when it is impractical or impossible to determine the cost or other basis of the portion of the property sold the amount realized on such sales should be applied to reduce the basis of the entire property and only the excess over the basis of the entire property is recognized as gain
2210360 confined in its application to those situations that present elements of value so speculative in character as to prohibit any reasonably based projection of worth
2210361 u nlike shareholder ownership rights that are separate from the contractual rights of the insurance policy the mutual policyholders ownership rights are inextricably tied to the underlying insurance contract
2210362 t here is no separately determinable or identifiable price for these ownership rights at the time of purchase of an insurance policy
2210363 the subject ownership rights could not be purchased nor sic sold separate from the purchase of an insurance policy
2210364 price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller neither being under a compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts
2210365 contingent upon facts and circumstances not possible to foretell with anything like fair certainty
2210366 those situations that present elements of value so speculative in character as to prohibit any reasonably based projection of worth
2210367 enough hard information in place from which willing buyers and willing sellers could construct soundly based equations of value
2210368 the shares of stock regard being had to their highly speculative quality and to the terms of a restrictive agreement making a sale thereof impossible did not have a fair market value capable of being ascertained with reasonable certainty when they were acquired by the taxpayers
2210369 t hey were not reflected in the capital account of the corporation and did not represent an absolute equitable ownership therein
2210370 the promise of future money payments was wholly contingent upon facts and circumstances not possible to foretell with anything like fair certainty
2210371 i n the last ten years there have been several demutualizations in the u s a the u k australia and most recently south africa
2210372 should fairly compensate for what policyholders lose in the demutualization namely voting control of the insurance company and the right to share in the insurance companys residual value if it is wound up
2210373 provided for a fixed allocation of 75 financial service shares to each eligible policyholder regardless of the number of policies held and for a variable allocation to each eligible policy of a number of financial services shares which depends on its cash value the number of years it has been in force and its annual premium
2210374 largely at the discretion of sun lifes board of directors and iii the
2210375 like any other judgment can be no better than the soundness of the reasons that stand in support of them
2210376 no longer your piece of the rock the silent reorganization of mutual life insurance firms
2210377 any amount received which is in the nature of a dividend or similar distribution
2210378 received those proceeds upon an entirely unrelated sale of the stock it received in the demutualization
2210379 fair market value is not nearly so universal a phenomenon as to justify such a comment and the implication is misleading
2210380 w hen property is exchanged for other property the property received in exchange shall for the purposes of determining gain or loss be treated as the equivalent of cash to the amount of its fair market value if any
2210381 out of the open transaction doctrine a new theory for taxing contingent payment sales
2210382 cottage saving association v commissioner refining the concept of realization
2210383 no taxable income had been derived from the sale when made
2210384 a portion of each payment under the contract was a return of capital and a portion represented gain
2210385 the locking device increases the practical difficulty of attributing a correct valuation to either piece of property as of the time of purchase since the very fact of the restraint usually affects the value of the combination and each of its components in amounts difficult to measure
2210386 w here there is no market value as in the situation with respect to the warrants there is no practical basis upon which an allocation can be made and the taxpayer is entitled to recover his entire original basis before gain or loss will be recognized
2210387 while we support the downsizing trend in principle we caution consumers to look at their long term owner costs and not rush to make a change they may later regret
2210388 yes i am licensed and no the company isnt under investigation
2210389 we would like to put in a good word for thrift as a value and a practice
2210390 millions of families today feel the american dream slipping away
2210391 they are losing hope of escaping from the cycle of over indebtedness holding a good paying job or moving up the income ladder
2210392 i live paycheck to paycheck now and wont be able to save like i should
2210393 i already work two jobs ive already cut back on everything including food i know all the right things to do but sometimes you have to live with doing the wrong thing just to live
2210394 i am close to 70 000 on about six to eight credit cards with interest rates from 9 percent to 25 percent
2210395 i am a 36 year old single mother i need to know how is it possible to save money when my bills are more than my bring home pay i dont splurge on anything and the clothes we purchase are from thrift stores please tell me how can i get ahead if im always behind
2210396 i think the other part of the problem is a lack of financial education
2210397 take wing in peace but remember my friend when you fly beyond this grim land in the name of god and destiny greet the rain and the blossoms for me

2210402 what we are seeing is a lot of people coming in who cannot qualify for government programs
2210403 im very excited the discussion about this has been generating a lot of attention but now our leaders have to start thinking about how we move forward to get people access to health care
2210404 going broke why americans cant hold on to their money

2210411 one of the reasons im promoting it today is im extremely anxious to reissue that old group of films i did so long ago in a galaxy far away
2210412 we worked on some with a company that was developing the technology a few years ago to convert films into 3 d we worked with them but the system works great its just not very practical so what weve been working on since then is to develop a sort of practical way to do it and we will get there its just a technological challenge

2210419 we normally just stand straight up and down it was a big struggle to move and sing the pop songs as well
2210420 it was the sheer fact that they dont know what they are
2210421 if everyone could adopt the hydrant that is at the front of their place just keep it clean whipper snipper around it and keep it clean for everybody
2210422 it is more of a safeguard for their own premises than anything
2210423 hopefully they will never have to use it but every spare minute you spend trying to do anything but put out a fire simply escalates the problem
2210424 transcare provide community transport and social support services to towns and villages within the upper hunter and muswellbrook shires
2210425 we have cars available to take people to specialist doctors appointments and hospital visits along the new england highway from newcastle to tamworth
2210426 we also refer people to other service providers similar to ours to ensure people are adequately looked after
2210427 volunteers are an integral part of the organisation as they devote their personal time and effort to assist the needs of our clients
2210428 we already offer services like the cancer helpline telephone support groups and internet forums that enable people in regional and remote areas to communicate and access cancer information
2210429 but this outreach service really adds another piece to the information pie
2210430 thanks to coles we can work to break down those distance barriers and connect people by delivering cancer information in an interactive physical and immediate setting

2210442 my name is carol dedelley and i am tim mcleans mother i am married to tim dedelley stepfather i am speaking on behalf of the four parents involved
2210443 we felt as a family that we needed to speak out in regards to the incorrect information that has been published regarding the family of tim mclean
2210444 we have always raised the children without the steps or half sibling distinctions we realize how confusing this can be to most people however in todays world of divorce and blended families it is the reality
2210445 in the first days of this tragic loss i was grateful that the media attention was not focused on me my husband tim or my son kendall however i was distraught at the anguish it was bringing to the rest of our family all of whom were in complete shock at the horrifying loss of our loved one
2210446 we feel that the media failed to obtain and confirm the facts before rushing to the presses in an effort to sell papers due to the international attention this story has received we want everyone to know the facts of this familys position
2210447 please respect our familys privacy during our time of mourning should we choose to speak out at a later time we will ensure that all media are duly notified
2210448 god is punishing canada for passing laws against wbc by exposing canadians as cannibals and highway decapitaters

2210469 the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some count slackness but is longsuffering toward us not willing any should perish but that all should come to repentance
2210470 the kings heart is in the hand of the lord like the rivers of water he turns it wherever he wishes

2210473 there continues to be improvements in weed control for organic systems that may close the gap in productivity of corn and soybeans in wet seasons
2210474 on the other hand technological advances may accelerate productivity gains in conventional systems that would outstrip the gains in organic systems even in favourable years
2210475 sophisticated optical devices that are mechanically robust yet fully biodegradable biocompatible and implantable dont exist today
2210476 such systems would greatly expand the use of current optical technologies in areas like human and livestock health environmental monitoring and food quality
2210477 for example at a low cost we could potentially put a bioactive silk film in every bag of spinach and it could give the consumer a readout of whether or not e coli bacteria were in the bag before the food was consumed
2210478 silks spun by spiders and silkworms represent the strongest and toughest natural fibres known they offer many opportunities for fictionalisation processing and biological integration when compared to conventional polymers
2210479 we have optical devices embedded with enzymes that are still active after almost a year of storage at room temperature this is amazing given that the same enzyme becomes inactive if forgotten and left unrefrigerated for a few days

2210503 sprint is now in a potentially difficult situation because by going to the market and not being able to get thedeal done youve now shown that your need to raise capital
2210504 i think it will really put some pressure on them to fairlyquickly come up with a plan b so that the markets can get asense as to how theyre going to recapitalize the balancesheet

2210510 i have been a longtime advocate for public financing of campaigns combined with free television and radio time as a way to reduce the influence of moneyed special interests
2210511 its one of those questions that theres no answer that would stop the incident from happening
2210512 then they began to pummel me i was facedown in the street
2210513 i would be a really little fish in a great big huge pond
2210514 im not a delegate so aside for going for the parties i really dont have any role there theres plenty to do here
2210515 to do that is a multi month process its a round robin its one of the hardest processes we do in a year
2210516 theres other nice people that purvey convenience in the area but i look at him as a real pioneer well miss him
2210517 the only people that bought them were the ones that couldnt afford them
2210518 even though i do have a good hand im worried about j 10 because thats a typical limp in hand early in a tournament
2210519 i get three callers which is not really good news
2210520 it tells me i need help im basically done with the hand
2210521 i check the turn because i dont want to lose too much money if someone has j 10
2210522 with a lot of amateurs in the hand theres no guarantee that if somebody else has a 10 theyre not going to raise me and i dont know how to deal with a raise here because theres a good chance its the nuts in which case i have a tough decision to make
2210523 a guy id never played with before whod been pretty active bets 1 000
2210524 the pot was about 1 700 it gets folded to me and i call i really have no interest in check raising here because if he has j 10 im going to lose more money and if he doesnt have j 10 im either splitting or winning the pot so i call
2210525 a really good card for me if he has j 10 and a really bad card if he has q 10
2210526 im not interested in betting here id rather give him a chance to bluff
2210527 so i check he bets 1 500 i dont like it and i dont like my hand but i call and he shows the q 10 for a better straight
2210528 i couldve lost more if i decided to play the hand aggressively because hes not folding in hindsight checking and folding is a good option for me but i chose to pay it off because it was a player i hadnt seen and had been aggressive so it wasnt out of the question that he was bluffing
2210529 against a tight player who i knew i think id check and fold on the turn
2210530 with struggles being waged by black people in the areas of education housing employment and many others it was only a matter of time before afro american athletes shed their fantasies and delusions and asserted their manhood and faced the facts of their existence
2210531 a lot of the black athletes thought that winning olympic medals would supersede or protect them from racism but even if you won a medal it aint going to save your momma from the effects of racism it aint going to save your sister
2210532 the best way to protect against getting measles is vaccination its important that people be up to date on their vaccine

2210535 the audit states 16 times that no response was provided by the school when it asked for a corrective action plan the confidential informant reported that all information to be given to the auditor was to go through joel pourier first
2210536 they failed to implement a balanced budget provide accurate information to state and federal authorities and couldnt account for some money they spent

2210542 es m s importante la salud que el dinero y el profesionalismo es cruel en el profesionalismo explotan a los atletas y despu s otros son los que se quedan con el dinero se desarrollan desde el punto de vista f sico pero no desde el punto de vista mental

2210547 tengo amigos boxeadores en varias partes del mundo porque yo pienso que el deporte crea amistad

2210553 bills as much a part of this team as anybody else and hes earned that right
2210554 he just loves this sport and he likes to be around it
2210555 my dad looked up local baseball teams on the internet because i had really started to like it
2210556 he found the princeton rays and we started coming to games here
2210557 i just got to know the staff really well and any time they needed anything id try to help in any way i could
2210558 if youve got a good batboy you dont notice him all that much if hes doing a bad job itll really disrupt the flow of the game
2210559 with bill i hear nary a word he keeps everything running very smoothly hes very much the professional and hes only 13
2210560 i get to meet the players theyre all really nice
2210561 the hitting coach taught me how to hit a little bit

2210563 tim beckham has this thing he calls the secret handshake and i had taken a picture of tim doing this secret handshake with bill when bill saw it he just went crazy and asked me if i could get him a copy of that photo for his birthday
2210564 he just adored both jeremy and tim and i knew that would mean the world to him
2210565 jeremy came back from the parking lot on his way out of town to take that picture with bill thats how much he means to these guys
2210566 to get to do something like this is something hell remember for the rest of his life whether its our team or the opponents some of these guys are going to make it big and when the gates close and you and i are up in the stands bills still out there on the field with these guys thats big
2210567 but how short of tying it up in the courts and being labelled obstructionists do we alter the course of an investment in this depressed region that could be worth as much as 5 billion when all is said and done

2210570 i wonder if windsor city councils reaction to the latest dric announcement will jeopardize the tunnel deal
2210571 its really more about raising charitable children than raising money

2210576 i think you feel more at home in the thirties
2210577 by taking her diary and surrounding it with so much historical detail koppel shows how one single figure from a citys past can frame a large scale social history that in its narrowness that of a young woman of a specific class ethnicity and location can still be epic in scope
2210578 how do you feel when a forgotten chunk of your life is handed back to you
2210579 we may be in the middle of the country but were not middle of the road

2210584 i did not feel like a joint participant i feel i have been reprimanded lectured and talked at
2210585 my understanding is this is the only development commission im aware of thats paid we certainly dont want in camera information but we certainly do want what the public has a right to know how their tax dollars are being spent
2210586 if we dont get the support we think we should get then well have to look at the freedom of information i guess
2210587 westpac gave out some very positive figures and the market liked it very reassuring for traders
2210588 we also saw continued strength in oil and gas producers including which is not surprising considering we saw crude oil bounce off recent lows overnight
2210589 managing risk remains a priority for us and we are maintaining our strong lending and credit risk disciplines
2210590 westpac also has a strong capital and funding position allowing us to effectively respond to the more difficult operating environment
2210591 we are not distracted by problems in our credit portfolio enabling us to focus on our strategic agenda
2210592 while loan volumes continue to slow at both the institutional and retail level westpac has grown ahead of system
2210593 housing lending has been particularly strong growing at 1 5 times system
2210594 compared to the other banks westpac seems to have chosen its risks more wisely said wilson htm analyst brett le mesurier
2210595 its asset quality is in excellent shape in an environment where credit quality is deteriorating and loan growth is slowing
2210596 the bank wouldnt have lent us the money if they didnt think we could pay it back
2210597 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
2210598 we have to be careful that were not destroying the industry that has made this country so great and certainly the industry that will take us forward into the future
2210599 the shame of the canadian experience is that they have lost their national champions certainly gold miner barrick is the only one remaining
2210600 in the interactions ive had with leaders in asia there is a general sense that weve lost or the relationship has diminished its more about the dollar on the day is the sense i get
2210601 its going to be a terrible mess to run them all
2210602 a judge could spend the rest of his life doing these
2210603 lea t hampton is going broke glam town 12m in the hole
2210604 everybody perceives east hampton to be the home of the rich and famous
2210605 when the summers over its just the same old town just like all these other towns
2210606 the disparity between rich and poor is probably unmatched anywhere in the world you have the heads of multinational corporations billionaires but of the year round population half the work force are undocumented immigrants living below the poverty level
2210607 i dont mind providing the programs but what the general public has to understand is that we dont manufacture money here

2210611 it was originally a code of ethics against sectarianism but this is more generic and global and is against anyone spreading hate
2210612 it tries to ameliorate the differences between sects and demonstrate that even if differences do exist they should be discussed in a civilised way
2210613 the code of ethics does not impede freedom of speech but what it does is specifically incite people to think before they put their foot in their mouth
2210614 if they do disagree which is human they should do it civilly and find a resolution to it or at least learn
2210615 they can say i do not agree but i respect your opinion rather than try to force people to come to their way of thinking
2210616 its about building respect and tolerance into our speech rather than inciting a hatred thats gone on for thousands of years
2210617 if you write respectfully and without wilfully inciting hatred you further the discussion and raise the bar
2210618 its a voluntary signing and an ethical understanding that a person takes on himself
2210619 all signatures will be on the website and names will be publicly shown
2210620 if they repeat the offence that blog forum or website will be crossed out from the list and will be shown as a transgressor
2210621 the committee will have the recourse like any member of the public to ask for a legal solution to a problem
2210622 its constructive criticism and a warning to the promoter of hate speech its to bring them into the field of dialogue rather than isolating them
2210623 some powerful people are trying to put the petrol on the fire to make it a bigger flame but the opposition is trying to make it go easy and we hope this will help
2210624 we hope this will be taken seriously by the owners of blogs and forums and it will make a difference
2210625 at first they might not accept the code but as more and more people join they will realise they are away from others
2210626 riddle me this batman when is a daughter not a daughter when shes a skeleton

2210634 it was mostly ad libbed with russell asking her for advice about hosting the show

2210642 our shareholders have been affected by the changes to the regulatory landscape
2210643 the outlook for net profit was worsened by the higher depreciation costs and the dividends not having the imputation credits was another factor
2210644 2009 is a hard turnaround year for them if they do well 2010 may not be as bad as theyve forecast
2210645 the spears family is very close friends with the the maloof family and vice versa

2210647 i suppose if someone told you jumping off the golden gate bridge was a good idea youd want to do it
2210648 wow i really dont want to go out and chase illegal immigrants in this heat today
2210649 hey i know instead of hiring more people to help us go out and get them lets spend that same ton of money on an ad campaign so theyll just come to us
2210650 oops what was i thinking of course ill give up everything i fought for and let you send me back but in the 90 days i still have here i want to go to san francisco i hear its also a really good idea to jump off the golden gate bridge

2210654 i think the people who know what the fire department needs are already here on the inside
2210655 he cared about me first and the job second i have great respect for him
2210656 he always took the time to help us through our problems and work towards making things better he always listened
2210657 you hear all the stories about a country overridden by poverty but you cant really grasp it until youve seen it
2210658 politicizing the olympic games and especially using them to interfere in chinas domestic affairs
2210659 phil said david was interested in seeing something done with in my own words this zeitgeist play which was uncannily prescient about the situation we now find ourselves in in iraq and i get the play and read it and im blown away because hes absolutely right
2210660 so it was a top flight production but somehow or other it has been lost to history
2210661 he wants to have it done by november so we can immediately find a way to get it produced
2210662 i spend a lot of time teaching writing doesnt take the back seat but i like to have them share my energy
2210663 i wouldnt want to take my energy away from the kids for the poetry
2210664 ill still write poems but ive always been profoundly moved by elephants my plan is to get near them sri lanka or something
2210665 then ill do some nonfiction writing and hopefully make money to give to these places
2210666 i dont really have the money but no one else was going to do it and they needed it to get it off the ground
2210667 its the kind of thing ive talked about for a while helping the kids with their art so it was an opportunity
2210668 i think ill be back at it at some point soon
2210669 big big big news for now all i can tell you is this phantasmagoria history of a haunted city is in the pre production stage
2210670 with a focus on portsmouths haunted history and a unique and often overlooked past
2210671 that would be the extremely generous jim white thank god hes talented
2210672 we would like to cut those interest rates but we will have to assess what is happening to our funding costs at that time
2210673 obviously there are a number of factors that we have to consider at the time of making a rate move
2210674 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time
2210675 theres no question that the operating environment that were working within has deteriorated at a more rapid rate than we anticipated at the half
2210676 and weve seen the impact of higher interest rates higher oil prices rising food prices on consumer discretionary spending
2210677 and this is reflected in lower consumer confidence weaker retail sales and softer business expectations
2210678 so all of this is resulting in system credit growth falling quite rapidly now down to an annualised rate of 5 6 per cent over the june quarter
2210679 and so were in the position where the reserve bank as flagged in their statement on tuesday is looking to ease monetary policy so quite a change from a few months ago
2210680 i think its positive that we have a reserve bank thats prepared to move quickly and that we have visible room to move
2210681 obviously there are a number of factors that we have to consider at the time of making a rate move
2210682 if the reserve bank takes a view and takes a decision to cut rates they will be the very people the reserve bank has in mind
2210683 if they do not receive the full benefit of what the reserve bank has intended then in a way thats subverting what the reserve bank is trying to do through its monetary policy
2210684 the strongest indication i can give you is that we want to pass on an interest rate cut if funding costs allow
2210685 our local market seems to be buoyed by the prospect of a potential rate cut in september
2210686 if that happens it would be good for the equity markets
2210687 westpac gave out some very positive figures and the market liked it very reassuring for traders
2210688 we also saw continued strength in oil and gas producers including woodside petroleum which is not surprising considering we saw crude oil bounce off recent lows overnight

2210690 mine is a tomboyish character in the first half i wear modern outfits and in the second i switch to traditional costumes i had many punjabi friends during my modelling days so i could do justice to the punjabi character in the film it has plenty of scope for acting
2210691 i am now banking on parundu which i am doing with mammootty wherein i play a character haunted by a bitter past during childhood these roles gave me creative satisfaction when things were not going well in kollywood

2210694 you have to draw the line somewhere and we feel were drawing the line in a place canadians are comfortable
2210695 the chinese government leaders and also the government sanctioned three self patriotic movement leaders have spoken publicly to the media that the foreign evangelistic effort in china during the olympics is not welcome and will not be tolerated
2210696 to the house church leaders its an issue of the lordship of christ to the church
2210697 and if the church ceases to do evangelism is it the true church its a big question
2210698 you are not allowed even to have fellowship with foreign christian leaders without explicit approval from the communist partys religious affairs bureau
2210699 look for transportation planning to be a major challenge in augusta in 2009
2210700 on thursday congresswoman shea porter spoke on the house floor in support of legislation which would promote the responsible domestic production of oil and national gas
2210701 this legislation will provide new hampshire consumers with some much needed relief we need to start responsible domestic drilling today it is our patriotic duty to break our dependence on foreign oil with conservation and promoting other long term energy sources
2210702 start drilling on the 68 million acres of land they currently have leased
2210703 lifting the ban on offshore drilling is incredibly shortsighted and will do nothing to solve our nations long term energy crisis it is unfortunate president bush continues to focus on sound bites over solutions
2210704 ultimate expression of doctrinal clarity at the service of our christian and non christian brothers and sisters who are not in communion with rome and as well as for the greater understanding and appreciation of this revealed doctrine concerning the mother of the redeemer by the people of god at the outset of this third millennium of christianity
2210705 i believe the time is now for the papal definition of the relationship of the mother of jesus to the each one of us her earthly children in her roles as co redemptrix mediatrix of all graces and advocate to solemnly proclaim mary as the spiritual mother of all peoples is to fully and officially recognize her titles and consequently to activate to bring to new life the spiritual intercessory functions they offer the church for the new evangelization and for humanity in our serious present world situation

2210737 smart as a whip so theres nothing he cant learn
2210738 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech that he gave in 2002
2210739 hillary clinton was making a strong and valid argument for why john mccain will be the next president
2210740 in this case we couldnt have said it better ourselves
2210741 we feel theres a serious intention by the american forces for a withdrawal timetable at the very least
2210742 if we want to tackle the problem of youth crime we need to take action early to stop kids from embarking on a life of crime before its too late the old parties are falling over each other trying to be tough on crime but nothing is being done do stop young people getting sucked in to a cycle of crime
2210743 we see this visit as unfortunate especially in the sensitive and crucial time in which iran is not giving a direct reply to the west about its nuclear programme
2210744 my ego is not big enough to say im going to come in and try to be the hero in september thats not the idea its to get healthy enough to play and help this team in whatever capacity i can

2210784 its a disappointment but not a shock not a blow
2210785 weve known about it for four weeks but despite that we did announce only two weeks ago that the prize money for 2008 09 would be increased by 250 000
2210786 the reason its a disappointment and not a crisis is that over the last four years we have built up the reserves of world snooker to in excess of 4m
2210787 theyve both had fundamental changes in the ways their businesses operate
2210788 essentially except for the character names and the relationship developed between the main characters played by defendant kevin costner and his daughter the entire concept of swing vote was taken from the copyrighted work

2210794 people have treated it is a high tech product and not as a friendly simple kind of product
2210795 i always believe simple is better and there has to be a simple way of doing this
2210796 sopping wet hair i dont want anyone to see me like this
2210797 this is a self funded company we dont have the money to do everybody so we have to be real cautious about how we get there
2210798 we could easily divert ourselves by getting into the college market too quickly ive got to make an impact with the baby boomers before we start trickling down to do everybody else
2210799 skinny but not the older h 323 which is the earliest signaling protocol used for multimedia communications over ip based networks
2210800 enterprises today are spoilt for choice by the many players selling low cost voip equipment
2210801 unfortunately this is not the case in voip monitoring and analysis solutions apart from being expensive most monitoring solutions are very vendor or equipment specific
2210802 the amount of video being delivered for this years olympics exceeds all the prior summer games broadcasts in terms of hours and complexity
2210803 our biggest challenge is the scale of what we are doing and the many different standards of the various new media formats
2210804 it seems like every day nbc is signing up a new distribution outlet with a new format
2210805 we have done a lot of different video players for different clients what is unique about this one is bringing content that has never been seen before online up until relatively recently a very small amount of the games were televised now you watch every minute of whatever contest that you want to see

2210809 searching gt gt for foo returns 20 hits which one do i want
2210810 one of the things ive noticed the past year or so is that the silicon valley view of video on the web is very youtube centric
2210811 there are a lot of questions of whats being done and not done and there a lot of biases i dont think are accurate
2210812 when we started looking three and a half years ago at what was happening with our content we saw indications that what was happening was similar to in the music industry people were distributing over the air to peer to peer networks
2210813 we wanted to be proactive its obvious people are doing this because they want the product and arent getting it the way they wanted to
2210814 that put us on the map next we wanted to offer episodes for free and ad supported
2210815 we want to be the first to deliver 10 million concurrent users on the internet
2210816 on a prolific basis yahoo brings a pretty sizable distribution throughout the yahoo network whether its yahoo movies or yahoo tv or our other partners like walmart com or distributed through ebay
2210817 the trickiest part of it is that a lot of these distribution windows make a lot of money for the studios and a lot of them are tied to long term agreements he said
2210818 every major media person ive spoken to in the past month has that skepticism and fear that anything i sell will be cheaper three months from now
2210819 the younger generations dont value that dvd case or box set that the older generations do
2210820 if the movie industry doesnt embrace digital sales the younger generation could turn to gaming and social networking and other alternative forms of entertainment
2210821 when you sell a physical dvd youre making a lot more money than if you sell the movie online
2210822 the iocs priority is to ensure that as many people as possible get to experience the magic of the olympic games and the inspirational sporting achievements of the olympic athletes
2210823 for the first time in olympic history we will have complete global online coverage and the ioc will have its own broadcast channel which will make fantastic olympic footage available where young generations of sports fans are already going for online entertainment
2210824 the olympic games are not that credible or relevant to most young people in the developed or developing world
2210825 weve contracted with some carriers to give us some really low rates to dial to beijing
2210826 you can get a long distance carrier overnight but there is an issue when you are trying to find a good rate and making sure that the quality of the calls is good that is what took a little longer
2210827 is something that needs to be taken up very seriously with all the wireless carriers in the united states its really very sad but the bottom line is that this is simply what the carriers choose to charge to roam internationally
2210828 it tells us there is an enormous need for what we do
2210829 if you go to one of the big providers and want to purchase conference calling services they sell it to you by the minute say for example 10 cents a minute so if you have five people on a call for an hour thats 300 minutes youll get a bill for 30 for that call what we do is say okay heres your conference room and its x dollars a month
2210830 there are people that will start a conference at 8 30 am and keep it open all day with all the endpoints being on skype since we charge a subscription fee instead of per minute that opens up a whole new collaboration opportunity for folks
2210831 primarily its a service used primarily by small businesses to collaborate more often and in higher clarity
2210832 we were spending almost 500 a month on conferencing alone and our costs were steadily increasing
2210833 now were spending a flat 200 a month and while the cost savings are great the ability to connect to the conference line in one click with skype without tying up the phone lines so we can interface with customers is equally valuable
2210834 my analogy is weve built the engine and weve built the car now were putting in the leather interior and that sort of thing
2210835 weve added it in australia well be adding it in israel
2210836 what weve found is that mainly the service is spreading through word of mouth
2210837 depending on your network connection it might take a few seconds for it to start playing
2210838 as far as we know were the only how to dedicated video site that permits you to view videos on the iphone 3g
2210839 for how to content its really quite handy for a variety of things
2210840 we think we are unique the speech engine world has been so focused on making that smarter than no one took a step back to say here is a big web with lots of data and we can use that to make speech work better
2210841 stringent lab and home trials including a test to deliver 20 hours of non stop hd iptv streams at 20mbps aggregate to six different locations throughout a simulated home environment with injected interference
2210842 we are arguably the only wi fi guys who have solved this problem for carriers now the carriers are looking to move to high definition weve sold 500 000 systems private labeled to carriers like deutsche telekom and those are 802 11g systems the 54 mbps systems we guarantee 20 mbps of predictable performance
2210843 carriers care about actual capacity what can they actually charge for
2210844 carriers are moving to high def which is much more intense in terms of capacity
2210845 our 802 11 g product just wont scale we started looking at 11n about a year ago we started building a unique and purpose built system to address the migration to hd its already in production it uses our smart antenna technology the same as in enterprise wireless lans
2210846 carriers are really looking to make more money by providing hd iptv to their subscribers
2210847 one problem is that as carriers move to hd they are gonna require a new system in the house to distribute that
2210848 weve done that were a bit different in the 802 11 world because were looking not at wi fi as a next step bringing together wi fi end solutions for the general market we are building 802 11n devices for specific applications in the carrier case its for multimedia distribution or iptv distribution mediaflex is built and designed just to do that one thing
2210849 most of our carrier clients are outside the u s
2210850 iptv hasnt penetrated the u s market for a number of reasons it has been an afterthought for carriers and also carriers have a much larger physical geographic area to cover here in europe its like a state in terms of physical geography they have a lot of users but not the kind that at amp t or verizon have its not easy for a carrier like at amp t and to get a million subscribers up and running they need to build up their infrastructure and footprint the north american carriers have taken an aggressive approach to bringing iptv to market but they want to bring a whole home dvr solution they are going to enter the market with high definition whereas international carriers have offered standard definition and are now just upgrading north american carriers want to leapfrog by coming to market with high definition services
2210851 it was doing so 24 7 regardless of the amount of congestion on the network or how small the file might be
2210852 we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
2210853 the commission did not intend for the internet policy statement to serve as rules
2210854 commissions order raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions we are considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays
2210855 the fccs bipartisan decision to punish comcast is a major victory
2210856 todays order makes it clear that there is nothing reasonable about restricting access to online content or technologies moving forward this bellwether case will send a strong signal to cable and phone companies that such violations will not be tolerated
2210857 this collaboration is a significant milestone in the evolution of ip based communications
2210858 the nationwide interoperability of toshibas equipment and paetecs sip trunking mitigates the need for large enterprises to create patchwork network solutions to address different parts of the country
2210859 the toshiba paetec sip trunking service gives toshiba strata cix ip system users isdn like features over a data connection without the need to buy separate services for voice and data
2210860 this agreement marks paetecs first national sales channel partnership with a voip cpe manufacturer and it gives hundreds of authorized toshiba dealers access to paetecs national support structure
2210861 our network services can help toshiba dealers further solidify their relationships with end user customers
2210862 as enterprise sip solutions evolve agreements between service providers and equipment manufacturers will increasingly become prevalent

2210869 what this means for the user is more gripping force with less effort
2210870 sals durability is due to the use of hardened alloy steel its versatility is due to its adjustable serrated jaws which can grip objects of up to 1 5 8 inches in diameter ideal for loosening tight bolts nuts pipes or other objects

2210873 i just know what our guys can and cant do and weve got guys that can make plays after the catch
2210874 so you dont always have to throw it down the field all the time get it in their hands quick and now the onus is on the defense to make tackles on guys that can make people miss
2210875 i think hes getting guys the ball in different positions in different areas of the field to give guys a chance to run after the catch
2210876 ultimately thats what youre going to need to make big plays youre not always going to get long bombs so youll have to get yards running after the catch moving and spreading guys around certainly helps

2211136 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine they wouldnt allow me to come in later
2211137 ive been pretty unimpressed with the iocs efforts in protecting athletes for giving them any options
2211138 visa applications from non accredited persons do not fall within the iocs remit and we are therefore not best placed to answer you on this question
2211139 but its between this government and joey as a private citizen
2211140 i dont begrudge them the olympics i think theyll do well with them
2211141 but there are so many of their governments policies that i find repulsive especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else

2211151 it all started way back when bessie the cow and lucas the pig fell in love
2211152 anyway farmer jacob yeston was making about sixty bucks a night off of jerry
2211153 one day a scientist took his kid to this particular circus and he saw the cowpig jerry in one of the sideshow attractions
2211154 bill paid farmer jacob what he promised and made arrangements for a crew to come and transport jerry to his facility in new jersey jerry didnt really care though he thought the circus was just moving jerry arrived in trenton on the morrow jerry was bewildered his cage for the overnight flight had been made of stainless no break steel it felt cold against his non hair parts of his body he was confused and began to whimper aloud for his mommy and daddy in the cold darkness of his cage his whimpers sounded like a cat on crank sorta like this meoinqu hey he was part french lucas was a french immigrant pig on leave from the war
2211155 oh some sort of hostage situation the states had gotten themselves into at the time
2211156 well bill and his team of specialists wanted nothing more to do with him so they shipped him off to england for a price of sixty thousand dollars
2211157 the english specialists could not deal with him with this monstrosity
2211158 one thousand people got sick and died in england the next week from partaking in the limited time only part and before we knew it all the cowpig had been eaten the families of the dearly departed sued mcdonalds for wrongful death who sued the english scientists for selling it to them who sued the americans for the exact same reason who in turn sued farmer jacob for breeding the damn thing who counter sued the families of the dead for first degree murder
2211159 well the trial followed in the winter of the next year
2211160 so we went to war with england what does that make sixteen wars against each other the war at any rate lasted for twenty and a quarter years of course bill the scientist thought it would be a great idea if he supported his country by being patriotic and got himself involved in the front lines of the war he got shot and killed during the second month of the second year of the war he was shot twice once in the torso and once in the buttocks he must have turned around as he went down it was rather fitting that he died on the front lines he did start the whole bloody mess if he hadnt went to that circus and bought cowpig from farmer jacob then the whole situation couldve been avoided
2211161 shit that really blows and now look because of what happened all the way back then the entire planet now has to be vegetarian
2211162 el hombre aprendi a hacerle frente a todos los asuntos de importancia sin recurrir a dios como una hip tesis funcional en asuntos que tienen que ver con la ciencia el arte y hasta la tica esto se ha dado por sentado por tanto tiempo que uno casi ni se atreve a tratar el tema m s pero durante los ltimos cien a os aproximadamente se ha aplicado cada vez m s a las cuestiones de la religi n es cada vez m s evidente que todo sigue su marcha sin dios tal como antes
2211163 se debe olvidar todo lo tradicional que se ha aprendido de dios quiz s hasta la propia palabra
2211164 cuando tillich habla de dios en profundidad l no habla de otro ser ni mucho menos
2211165 la profundidad y terreno infinitos e inagotables de todo ser
2211166 como l tillich dice el te smo seg n es comprendido com nmente ha hecho de dios una persona celestial y completamente perfecta que preside el mundo y la humanidad
2211167 estoy convencido de que tillich tiene raz n al decir que la protesta de ate smo contra una tal m xima persona es correcta
2211168 no se trata s lo de que el viejo en el cielo es s lo un s mbolo mitol gico para la mente infinita detr s del escenario ni que este ser es ben volo en vez de temeroso la verdad es que toda esta forma de pensar es incorrecta y si tal ser existiera ser a el propio diablo
2211169 a la larga ser tan dif cil convencer a los hombres de la existencia de un dios all afuera a quien deben llamar para ordenar sus vidas como persuadirlos a que tomen a los dioses del olimpo en serio

2211188 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2211189 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2211190 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2211191 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
2211192 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
2211193 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
2211194 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2211195 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2211196 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2211197 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2211198 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2211201 i have enjoyed greatly the second blooming that comes when you finish the life of the emotions and of personal relations and suddenly find at the age of fifty say that a whole new life has opened before you filled with things you can think about study or read about it is as if a fresh sap of ideas and thoughts was rising in you
2211202 my life was your dad my life was being a great partner it took me time to realise that no matter how much i pray that he will come back he wont so i realised that i had to stop living as a widow and living my lifeas me do i miss him each second but do i enjoy all the new experiences yes life is for the living when that comes to an end i will be with him again

2211204 a world wide positive intention experiment will be conducted at 8 pm universal time 08 08 08 to put an end to secret agreements that have prevented the revolutionary technology and knowledge of extraterrestrial life entering mainstream society a galactic freedom day declaration has been issued by cooperating citizen organizations clearly expressing humanitys intent to put an end to secret agreements concerning extraterrestrial life
2211205 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
2211206 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
2211207 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
2211208 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
2211209 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
2211210 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
2211211 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
2211212 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
2211213 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
2211214 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
2211215 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
2211216 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
2211217 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
2211218 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
2211219 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
2211220 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
2211221 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
2211222 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
2211223 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
2211224 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
2211225 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
2211226 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
2211227 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
2211228 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
2211229 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
2211230 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
2211231 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
2211232 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
2211233 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
2211234 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
2211235 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
2211236 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
2211237 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
2211238 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
2211239 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
2211240 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
2211241 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
2211242 a ffording same sex couples only a separate and differently named family relationship will as a realistic matter impose appreciable harm on same sex couples and their children because denying such couples access to the familiar and highly favored designation of marriage is likely to cast doubt on whether the official family relationship of same sex couples enjoys dignity equal to that of opposite sex couples
2211243 i would like to begin with the name change that i had suggested for bangalore
2211244 it is unfortunate that the cities including bengaluru are being built only for the youth and fast cars
2211245 i see that there has been a regional divide and the belgaum border issue with maharasthra is one such example
2211246 now coming to the key issue and also the most disturbing one terrorism
2211247 look at the situation surrounding the amarnath issue the amarnath yatra
2211248 it hurts me no end when i see pilgrimages becoming tourism and mosques and temples becoming hubs to hatch conspiracies all this has to stop
2211249 estamos en una situaci n bastante tranquila porque yo he dicho que ya tenemos una plantilla para confiar plenamente en ella
2211250 ahora no hay que ponerse nerviosos y decir tenemos que traer a otro jugador como sea yo creo que hay que estar tranquilos porque s lo nos sirven jugadores que realmente puedan mejorar y eso para un real madrid siempre es m s complicado que para otros equipos
2211251 the main objective of goonj the clothes bank was to provide clothes to millions of poor and needy people facing great hardship indignity besides health risk due to lack of proper clothing in far flung areas of the country
2211252 the trainers are saying that the tests are coming out positive
2211253 i think its just a question of taking some balls off the bat theyre saying likely saturday maybe friday
2211254 they did a great job it was an unbelievable experience
2211255 my own personal highlight was right before the ceremony when we met the president it was real quick he kind of made his rounds and met everybody on the u s team all of the u s athletes got to mingle around that was nice
2211256 when they lit the torch of course that was amazing to me
2211257 when it went all the way around to light the torch and when it caught fire my body went numb
2211258 i was in awe tonight when we walked through those tunnels its real bright in the tunnels then it gets a little dark and then suddenly it opens up and just to see 90 000 people in the audience and the roar they had going already amazing
2211259 that many athletes in the olympics to be with the likes of kobe bryant lebron james who brought up the rear for the u s team in the entrance parade and jennie finch those are amazing athletes
2211260 the lighting of the torch was pretty sweet to see
2211261 i told my family you guys have to tape this thing its gonna be awesome i wanted to take pictures but right as soon as were got into the tunnel my camera messed up
2211262 when we came through the tunnel you just see this huge stadium all these people staring at you cheering lights all the athletes are chanting usa
2211263 i got a little emotional thinking about family members thatll be watching it later
2211264 being there being away from the family and knowing theyll be watching got to me a little bit the way they put up the olympic flag was emotional and it was really awesome when china came in to hear the crowd support
2211265 we stuck together we walked out together then we got together once in the infield but after that its all for one
2211266 the bus afterwards that was awesome i was trying to learn chinese there was a french guy there trying to speak our language it was pretty cool the bus probably held 45 to 50 people and we had over 85 people on our bus the little girl who worked for the company was freaking out
2211267 were all very excited to get in the competition and play instead of just scrimmaging china or ourselves
2211268 we have intrasquad then china a couple times before actual games were kind of ready to go weve got the itch a little bit to see what were going to do
2211269 weve had a lot of consecutive days of working out
2211270 it will be good to get our feet under us and get this thing going
2211271 i dont know what theyre talking about or what the problem is
2211272 i want to stay out of it until i find out more
2211273 john and matt have done an excellent job i just want to be a guy who can make a contribution
2211274 probably the most exciting win ive been involved with here just the way the guys came after it if we take that attitude into every game every night we will have a really solid chance to play in october
2211275 i hit fourth one time in spring training and he mentioned it and i batted leadoff this year so ill just go out there and try to be myself i dont think ill change anything
2211276 i think he likes competing in the big leagues he is not intimidated by it
2211277 he caught the organizations eye the last two years and he was as advertised hes a good all around player
2211278 i do what they tell me to do and i dont control anything but what i do on the mound
2211279 i want us to win and do my little part that they need from me to win adding my little bit of sand to the pile is all im trying to do
2211280 especially since we lost joba to the rotation those young guys have done a tremendous job on the mound theyve been excellent
2211281 i am just grateful to god that my arm is strong and i am doing what i know i can do
2211282 ive been working hard and things are going good but this season is not over with there is still a lot to do a lot to accomplish with this team we have to keep winning
2211283 i want what everybody wants and that is to get to the world series
2211284 we all want the same thing in this clubhouse i dont let anything negative in my head i dont doubt myself i believe in myself im in the big leagues too im at the same level they are i will get you out if you get in there or i will try i want positive results that is all anybody is thinking about
2211285 i dont pay attention to what people say about me
2211286 they call me skinny this or that i dont care i dont need a body like jose canseco to play this game or generate my power im a pitcher i dont have to be barry bonds i dont need to be mark mcgwire people will say what they want but i know i can pitch with what i have
2211287 you give up a home run a walk or a hit rivera reminds you to focus on the next hitter
2211288 if you get in certain counts he says which pitch is going to be there when you have a hitter in certain situations he tells you what they look for you have a guy like that and he can help you every single day
2211289 there is a mass reallocation of assets people are selling off commodities and moving back into the u s dollar
2211290 there are expectations of a worsening economic environment we are now seeing japan heading into recession and a japanese recession could pull down other asian economies
2211291 the bears do appear to have momentum on their side here
2211292 technically there isnt a whole lot you can talk about until you get down to 3

2211294 the global economic outlook is worsening i see some further downward pressure on copper
2211295 desperate to avoid the merits of clemens claims mcnamee moves to dismiss on insubstantial and frivolous grounds that are contrary to controlling authority which requires mcnamee to answer to a texas court and jury for his intentional conduct that injured a texas resident in texas
2211296 because most of the key witnesses in this case are in the southern district of texas the cost of attendance in new york city for willing witnesses is substantially higher than it would be in houston and the courts in the southern district of texas are less congested
2211297 whether mcnamee falsely charged clemens with using steroids in new york texas or on the moon is of little consequence it simply does not change that mcnamees conduct was calculated to and did harm clemens where he lived and worked
2211298 i lost my husband 3 years ago this month and this has been the most intensely emotional year i thought my life would get better and it is the opposite

2211325 there is a great opportunity to become a green brand leader with the right commitment and marketing approach

2211334 why not make some kind of contest out of it
2211335 getting signed to a label at a really young age everything was really exciting
2211336 we thought this is the express train to fame we were living like rock stars and we were still teenagers
2211337 the person who signed us got shuffled out and then the guy who came in said whos making us money and who isnt
2211338 we played a showcase for him and that was basically it he didnt like the band and we got dropped
2211339 it was probably the best thing that could have happened
2211340 getting dropped really rocked our confidence but i think we all felt we still could do this
2211341 the first inklings of what we could be were formed on our debut
2211342 we all deep down wanted to move things on try and do as many new things as we could
2211343 when we started people had said to us i dont know what youre doing
2211344 so we definitely want to push things forward creatively and not rest on our laurels

2211354 but the fact that 19 were willing to shift backwards was surprising
2211355 it means people arent shopping there more and theyre not buying more stuff
2211356 the disparity between financials and energy has really been dramatic
2211357 most small cap companies revenue stream is based here in the u s
2211358 a lot of investors wanted to invest in large companies with global franchises
2211359 the small cap market had been getting hammered since late november
2211360 stuck in the mud for a while were not through this financial crisis by any means
2211361 it makes for a very advantageous place for active managers
2211362 our painstaking investigations have shown that the management of the company in collaboration with the epa management has been able to append their signature on a secret document that no epa public hearing should be held on their new prestea south project for no apparent reasons
2211363 we are in an election year and we would not allow anybody to disturb the fragile peace that we have been enjoying since 2002 in prestea and will not allow ourselves to be cheated this time as was done to us in june 28th 2002 and october 24th 2002

2211365 ive never seen a zucchini so huge oooh theres lots of them
2211366 most of the blame goes to the financial sector which is now projected to record a 90 decline in results vs the week earlier estimate of a 60 drop
2211367 it all just sits there what am i going to do
2211368 raised sheep on the former white house lawn during world war i as part of the white houses war mobilization effort
2211369 eleanor roosevelt was a victory gardener and grew beans and carrots on what had been the white house lawn this was going on by 1943 she inspired millions of other home gardeners in their efforts
2211370 we give tax breaks to people to encourage them to put hybrid cars in their garages and solar panels on their roofs so why not a tax break to encourage environmentally friendly and healthy food production
2211371 i would like it to be clearly understood that proclaiming this area as a national park does not mean that the different existing land users will be terminated but it will be managed better
2211372 there are four quince trees in the garden at the cloisters the museum in
2211373 for a lot of us tv is a career and we love it however being able to be on stage and play music is a dream come true
2211374 we are thrilled to bring our two worlds together and share it with so many people for such good causes
2211375 we are excited to expand our netflix live on location platform to include a band that embodies the freshness and creativity of tv today
2211376 television content is a significant part of the choices we offer at netflix so showcasing band from tv as part of our signature summer series is the perfect way to pay tribute to this important genre while bringing the public entertainment theyll love

2211380 she doesnt know what she wants but she picked a major just to have something to put on her diploma when she graduates
2211381 my son wont be going to college he decided to work instead college costs too much and we just cant afford those huge tuition payments he looked at community college but figured he could do better just getting a local job and trying to get promoted
2211382 my daughter graduated from college last spring and has not been able to find a job this summer she is home depressed and worried about her college loan payments which she has to start paying this fall she thought about going to grad school but its too late to apply for this fall i found her a job working in my office from september but shes not happy about it i dont know what to tell her this is just how life is
2211383 oh i think it is so important for kids to go abroad weve been taking our kids on vacations to mexico and europe for years it really gives them a global perspective and im sure that colleges will look at that two week house building experience in mexico city last summer as a big plus on their college applications everybody knows that universities are looking for students who have been abroad
2211384 dont talk to me about saving money its just not possible if you have kids in college all you can do is bite the bullet and pay the bills it makes me ill if i think about it so i dont instead i focus on the fact that you can never go wrong investing in a college education
2211385 the champagne is flavored with apricot puree from a tree right outside the door
2211386 fun sexy drinks from the garden are a great way to convey the philosophy of eating locally seasonally and sustainably
2211387 given the economy i thought it would be a bit slower
2211388 i used to come here for the dining the movie theater
2211389 those things we did retain we enjoy them more because theyre not spread out over a five bedroom house in upper bethesda
2211390 we want people who appreciate the building and will treat it as their home and who will call the building home for a long time
2211391 i understand some people have problems but everything has been okay for me
2211392 they greet you with a smile make promises offer you champagne then you sign a lease which says you have to pay your rent on the first of each month for the next year he is only posting here because they are not getting the type of people they want to rent these apartments
2211393 we really do believe summer is the time to rest and rejuvenate and then come back to school in september excited and ready to go
2211394 i think we went for several years requiring more and more and more
2211395 to make sure it benefits the learner instead of burdens the learner
2211396 we may as well just throw all these letters up into the wind
2211397 i dont think theres any doubt in anyones mind that we have a moral and statutory duty to notify people that evidence exists that could prove their innocence
2211398 by choosing to use the mail we are selecting the least reliable method of notification
2211399 i think it will work in many many of the cases in those cases where it doesnt work then we can explore another option
2211400 my hands youre going to make me lose my hands
2211401 this helps build skills it helps build confidence and it helps build awareness of how to work in a very challenging environment
2211402 in any mass casualty event theres always going to be the fog and friction of war the element of the unknown it could be a jungle it could be an urban environment it could be a desert but these skills persevere
2211403 you can talk about it in the classroom but until you get out here and have all the variables in place you just cant simulate it the stress level so many things in your head
2211404 even though we know in the backs of our minds that this is artificial and a mock experiment it prepares us for the real thing
2211405 it takes out the oh my gods of seeing these battle injuries for the first time
2211406 its our mission to put ourselves in the position where we can help those who are in need we have to be the best possible stewards of the money that people donate to the army
2211407 we gave ourselves timelines and projections and we even said by march 31 2009 if it is not making their targeted financial goals that the center should close as of aug 1 2009
2211408 we would not want to operate the center if it was fully subscribed with kids of families with some means
2211409 to preach the gospel of jesus christ and to meet human needs in his name without discrimination
2211410 from a public health standpoint thats not going to help the consumer or the doctor to treat their illness
2211411 acting with an abundance of caution we are recalling the product from distribution channels until we can determine whether illnesses in virginia are connected to our operations or have some other original source or cause we wish to express our sympathy to those taken ill and we are working diligently to correct the situation
2211412 there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death
2211413 it is a lovely area and we are upset about this
2211414 can you believe two occurrences in days this is illegal and its damaging for a very precious resource we have wed like to get to the bottom of it and find the culprits this is outrageous
2211415 you would think it would be done under the cover of darkness but its a secluded community so it wouldnt have to be
2211416 the tenure issue is probably going to be the determining factor
2211417 i dont want teachers going back to school with this concept hanging over their heads
2211418 were confident things will be resolved by the beginning of school
2211419 we believe that teachers really do see the advantages of this
2211420 they know what rights they do and dont have they really believe this is going to be in the best interests of students and teachers in the long run
2211421 the washington teachers union negotiations team is very aware that our members are extremely concerned about their seniority and tenure rights and will not reach a tentative agreement that is unfair and leaves members vulnerable to arbitrary terminations and no due process rights
2211422 from all accounts this year is the most mismanaged programmatically and financially in the history of this program
2211423 there are just so many facets to it kids who didnt get paid kids who got paid who didnt work kids who may not live in the city
2211424 it attempts to strike that balance to provide full credit for the ideal students who graduate with a diploma
2211425 but it also offers recognition although lesser credit for successful efforts to keep children in school like a ged because if students are not in school they cant learn
2211426 we have to be careful that we dont create unintended consequences by putting a lot of weight to last resort options
2211427 all of this really reinforces the importance for counties to increase their investment in early childhood development now
2211428 if you dont make that investment one of the penalties you pay down the line is that you have kids in school who dont speak english well and whose overall performance lags behind
2211429 even more worrisome is that over half of the english as a second language learners in high school were native born
2211430 the bubbling up of minorities that were now seeing at the younger ages will continue to move up through the age range through the teenage years the working age years and then the housing buying years
2211431 the child population is really a microcosm of the future
2211432 you cannot necessarily predict that just because theyll become majority minority all these schools will become low income
2211433 the washington area has one of the most diverse foreign populations in the nation
2211434 the system is supposed to catch and report that sort of information
2211435 i had never heard of any of this before his previous supervisor had never heard of any of this before his current supervisor had never heard of any of this before
2211436 it surely seems as though ivins was a troubled man and something should have picked this up earlier he should have been rescreened and reevaluated in terms of his ability to have the access that he had
2211437 were trying to create a synergistic environment between the businesses the faculty and the students
2211438 start up companies will have a place to be nurtured grow and then grow into the business park
2211439 i researched a lot because i didnt know the area
2211440 when i found out the train was on the back end of the property that was it
2211441 i walk 75 yards from my place to the train station
2211442 i can hear the trains but its not loud enough to bother me
2211443 when im inside with the windows shut and the television on i dont hear it at all
2211444 i work a lot so it hasnt been a problem
2211445 we were new to the area we didnt know anything about it
2211446 we saw the complex sitting on top of the hill
2211447 the customer service was good they took an interest in what we were trying to accomplish
2211448 id always lived in a house so im not used to someone above me
2211449 the entire time ive lived here ive heard the train twice of course im on the front side of the property near the front gate but noise hasnt been a problem
2211450 its very quiet people speak in the hallway but everybody tends to stay to themselves
2211451 the lights from all the restaurants are aglow it looks like christmastime
2211452 we have a lot of government and military residents local teachers single parents theyre across the age span we have one couple well into their retirement years who decided to sell their house and come here it gives them freedom now they spend more time traveling
2211453 its really a good place to bring a book a glass of wine sit chill
2211454 im not the one asking for this the police insist
2211455 the air conditioning system here is not very powerful just wait another hour and the room will get cooler
2211456 how to grow vegetables amp fruits by the organic method
2211457 key milestones were reached for our c2l octreotide goserelin formulation and ngr delivery technology which increased their respective potential values moreover these remarkable achievements allowed us to intensify our divestment efforts to monetize these assets before year end
2211458 this is a core objective of our strategic plan aimed at bringing non dilutive cash inflows to fund the companys r amp d in virology and extend its runway to financing
2211459 just recently we announced merck amp co s decision to suspend the development of ppl 100 mk 8122 pending the outcome of additional work to evaluate other precursors of the drug prodrugs formulation options and back up compounds although this represents a setback our partnership with merck continues and we await their further progress on the program
2211460 overall its remarkable value for the dollar when you consider the size of the apartments and the convenience
2211461 its really big so three people can live in a two bedroom and still have their own space
2211462 im extremely busy i like the convenience of all the amenities and having a metro station right here
2211463 the movie theaters are amazing theyre brand new with chairs that go back and theyre never crowded
2211464 the rent is high but its worth it i talk to people who live in d c who pay close to what im paying but they dont get all the fancy stuff like the nice gym and the tanning booth
2211465 compared to everything around the area the complex is outstanding
2211466 its very comfortable if you are looking for a place where you can be comfortable studying and playing this is it
2211467 the security people pretty much know everyone who lives here and guests have to sign in
2211468 we initially thought it was a joke until the water started entering our houses
2211469 most of the things we have in our various rooms in the building started floating it was more like what we watch on cnn and bbc where flood displaces people on daily basis
2211470 if they dont pay you the rent it is a long arduous process to get them out
2211471 it is a peculiar part of the good photographers adventure to know where luck is most likely to lie in the stream to hook it and to bring it in without unfair play and without too much subduing it
2211472 no no dont you remember your demise from episode 1
2211473 only pictures that look as if they were easily made can convincingly suggest that beauty is commonplace
2211474 soth and henderson present us with beauty we can look through not just look at
2211475 do you have any advice for translating that reading into actual applicable learning and new insight that will stay me for longer than the few days after finishing a book have you any advice for someone without an arts background
2211476 the photograph isolates and perpetuates a moment of time an important and revealing moment or an unimportant and meaningless one depending upon the photographers understanding of his subject and mastery of his process
2211477 its much better because here i have two bedrooms and two bathrooms and its much bigger
2211478 i just like it because i got the bigger room this time
2211479 im a lot healthier here i breathe a lot better and i have the fitness center
2211480 before it used to be mostly spanish speaking but not anymore now its such a mix arabic mongolian lots of others
2211481 all of this is a great idea we all live in one world we ought to be taking care of this planet
2211482 some of the things we are doing are so basic
2211483 were going to make the polar bear the face of global warming its a whole outreach program
2211484 if 10 percent of oakwoods guests simply reduce their energy and water usage by 5 percent it will result in a reduction of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases by more than 1 million pounds
2211485 i think thats fair to ask anyone everywhere in the world to do that
2211486 before an owner of a housing accommodation may sell the accommodation the owner shall give the tenant an opportunity to purchase the accommodation at a price and terms which represent a bona fide offer of sale
2211487 there is nothing in the statute that puts any obligation on the current owner therefore taking all the facts even in a light most favorable to plaintiff defendant could not have violated the statute as it was the subsequent owner and not the seller of the property
2211488 the absolute priority of the tenants rights and the conditional nature
2211489 a third party who wishes to purchase an accommodation only has a conditional right a right conditioned on the exercise of tenant rights under the act
2211490 get them out of there now or i will throw them outside in the dumpster
2211491 its just a beautiful apartment if it wasnt so pleasant i would not be here
2211492 be conservative in what you do be liberal in what you accept from others
2211493 getting more and more pressure from dollar strength and it doesnt seem reversible for now
2211494 all the arts are based on the presence of man only photography derives an advantage from his absence photography affects us like a phenomenon in nature like a flower or a snowflake whose vegetable or earthly origins are an inseparable part of their beauty
2211495 today the iraqi oil ministry celebrates a return to work by iraqi oil exploration teams after 20 years of interruption
2211496 when i photograph what im really doing is seeking answers to things
2211497 the charm one might say the genius of memory is that it is choosy chancy and temperamental it rejects the edifying cathedral and indelibly photographs the small boy outside chewing a hunk of melon in the dust
2211498 if i knew how to take a good photograph id do it every time
2211499 at market rate were still very reasonable especially with the amenities we offer
2211500 being part of the housing opportunities commission theyre very careful with rent increases
2211501 older buildings dont have the amenities and the newer buildings are much more expensive
2211502 for us it was really just convenience cost and of course the location its reasonably priced so youre not going to find luxury stuff
2211503 the building is well kept clean and secure its definitely cost effective to live here
2211504 to me this place is set up for entertaining exercising and relaxation with the theater and everything else all on one level
2211505 just walking in the building i was taken with the common areas
2211506 the pub room was unique and this had additional amenities to offer that were very appealing
2211507 exterior was designed to flow with the architecture of georgetown prep
2211508 i can jump on the metro and run downtown or i can be in bethesda and in minutes be near all of the restaurants its convenient as can be to 495 and virginia too
2211509 the accelerating growth of carbon markets resulting from the un brokered kyoto climate change agreement
2211510 many of our islands are threatened by rising sea levels
2211511 we now have malaria around mt kilimanjaro we never had that before
2211512 we cannot estimate the total cost as we dont know how severe the impact will be it is already not possible to grow cotton and maize in some areas how much the losses will be is harder to say
2211513 but the procedures are complicated africa is already behind in attracting foreign direct investment the same problems stand in the way of cdm projects
2211514 its a major flaw developed countries need to reduce their emissions by 90 per cent we need more drastic action market forces alone cannot deliver the reductions needed markets caused the problem in the first place
2211515 my mobile phone would have been a bit more quick on the draw than my view camera
2211516 a photograph is a secret about a secret the more it tells you the less you know
2211517 were not going to end up like the bitchy couple are we
2211518 let the subject generate its own photographs become a camera
2211519 ultimately success or failure in photographing people depends on the photographers ability to understand his fellow man
2211520 having a safeguarding from an eternal death is only possible through the messiah jesus who has thoroughly paid everything
2211521 art is not to be found by touring to egypt china or peru if you cannot find it at your own door you will never find it
2211522 we began looking at this problem in 2001 when failure rates for the introductory course were as high as 50
2211523 the first solution was to teach cs with media as the focus point to add interest as opposed to just teaching code this proved successful and the idea to use robotics as the context for engaging students in the classroom grew from this
2211524 there has been positive feedback from the engineering department at georgia tech
2211525 for engineering students the physical grounding of this approach in the introductory course is of great benefit
2211526 at the moment fluke has 90 of what a robot needs without the mobility
2211527 future versions of the system will be based on an upgraded version of the fluke to which extra circuits and wheels are added by hijacking the wheels of the scribbler we will be able to produce a tool that can do the same job at a lower cost per unit
2211528 am ehesten entspricht solche taktische atomwaffen scheinen jedoch weder in waffenarsenalen der usa noch der sowjetunion vorhanden zu sein nur diese beiden staaten besitzen das notwendige know how denn levi ber cksichtigt diese taktischen nuklearsprengk pfe nicht
2211529 nicht und auch der direkte angriff auf eine nukleare anlage bleibt unerw hnt wie wir bereits
2211530 suppose you like monet paintings and you want to collect anything that becomes available
2211531 yes but thats a mountain or made of stone or bronze or
2211532 jeff can you think of examples in history where photographs were combined with three dimensional sculptural work including movement change and progression over time usually we understand visual arts as generally either illustionistic representational or abstract non objective in this case i find the boundaries between such categories and disciplines blurred and to some extent destroyed
2211533 in my view you cannot claim to have seen something until you have photographed it
2211534 esta comunidad imaginada aparece hoy nuevamente materializada en cierto modo en este cuerpo de textos que son acaso
2211535 en la perspectiva te rica de antelo la excentricidad se inscriba como alternativa a la idea pertenencia a la naci n en tanto naturalizada y restrictiva categor a de lo moderno

2211539 all children are artists the problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up
2211540 all the arts are based on the presence of man only photography derives an advantage from his absence photography affects us like a phenomenon in nature like a flower or a snowflake whose vegetable or earthly origins are an inseparable part of their beauty
2211541 the charm one might say the genius of memory is that it is choosy chancy and temperamental it rejects the edifying cathedral and indelibly photographs the small boy outside chewing a hunk of melon in the dust

2211544 it was the largest air conditioned building in the world when it opened
2211545 all the local celebrities would come here in the 50s
2211546 for me sitting in the lobby its better than watching cable tv
2211547 insurance companies have ruined all the fun things in life
2211548 i step out the back door of the building and about 80 feet later im in nordstroms i am 300 feet from metro
2211549 the location allows me at a moments notice run to meetings and theres no delay i avoid the hassle of driving downtown
2211550 it was time for a new look even though the building is not that old
2211551 theres been so much development in the area that we wanted to redo it to keep it fresh
2211552 as previously addressed their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2211553 the public has no notion of the extent of the pain that my daughter my family and i have suffered privately over the last four years
2211554 when subject matter is forced to fit into preconceived patterns there can be no freshness of vision following rules of composition can only lead to a tedious repetition of pictorial cliches
2211555 children have been short changed in the response to aids they are visible in the photo opportunities and headlines but mostly invisible in the response to hiv
2211556 anything thats 40 to 50 years old starts falling apart
2211557 a lot of residents had been here for a long time and were on month to month agreements
2211558 the price has gone up and was basically out of the price range of most people
2211559 its tight for me but the thing is if you want to be close to work and it means more to you then you have to find other places to cut back
2211560 the owner holds an apartment open for the would be resident and is damaged when that person backs out of the agreement to sign a lease
2211561 applicants should carefully read the applications that they sign to make sure they understand the terms of the agreement
2211562 its in everybodys best interests to try to have the commission respond to us so we can answer these questions and really put it behind us and continue to do the work of the ura and the citizens of the city of pittsburgh
2211563 the mayor is not going to get word from the commission
2211564 if he does they will be violating mr fords right to confidentiality
2211565 only the commission as an entity may act upon the closing of a preliminary inquiry to date the commission has not acted upon the matter involving your client
2211566 if a formal investigation had been lauched pat wouldve been notified and he hasnt been notified
2211567 as a matter of law there cant be an investigation whats left to occur is this formality of closing the inquiry
2211568 your failure thus far when you have granted such expediency in the past and possess said authority violates my clients rights
2211569 lets let them conclude their investigation and once we do that well make our decisions here on the ura level
2211570 nick y yo nos am bamos todav a nos queremos por dos a os fue mis 24 7 pero era demasiado dif cil mantenerlo oculto de la gente discut amos mucho y eso no era muy divertido
2211571 when it departments buy blades now they have to make a strategic decision to align themselves with that particular vendors vision of how blades should work
2211572 microsoft needs to have a license that allows independent software vendors to redistribute windows as a bag of bits
2211573 as with all models they are a simplification of reality and determining the proper granularity soon becomes a nightmare
2211574 the commission concluded that the concentration is unlikely to raise competition concerns
2211575 i have responded to consistently to these tabloid allegations by saying i dont respond to these lies
2211576 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2211577 but i would expect that he would not speak or have any role at the convention unless this is cleared up
2211578 it is time for me to step aside so that history can blaze its path
2211579 who will take the final steps to 1600 pennsylvania avenue
2211580 a national reputation as a forceful and tireless champion for regular hard working people
2211581 in my view you cannot claim to have seen something until you have photographed it
2211582 it is a peculiar part of the good photographers adventure to know where luck is most likely to lie in the stream to hook it and to bring it in without unfair play and without too much subduing it
2211583 since the recording process is instantaneous and the nature of the image such that it cannot survive corrective handwork it is obvious that the finished print must be created in full before the film is exposed
2211584 one thing thats really nice around here is that a lot of people have pets its a pet friendly place
2211585 we go for a daily walk and we like that very much
2211586 we met three or four couples in the play area
2211587 hans agerande de senaste tta ren har varit s brutalt och s katastrofalt att jag har sv rt att se n got positivt i honom
2211588 a few companies such as google yahoo and amazon are already running these facilities on their own and i think ibm is trying to target those businesses that are ahead of the curve and those that see commercial opportunities in the web 2 0 and virtual world environments that need this kind of hardware and software
2211589 its going to be highly virtualized in all dimensions from the servers to the storage to the network and even application virtualization
2211590 its green by design so the building has a high degree of recyclable materials and it is very energy efficient
2211591 from a workload perspective this facility will show ibm using the cloud computing model and the service delivery model to deliver services in a much more scalable and economic fashion to our outsource clients
2211592 they were so excited theyre rvers so they can go anywhere on the road find a computer go into the phoenix public library catalogue download a book and play it while they drive down the highway
2211593 we also know we are touching only a small percentage of each librarys patrons
2211594 its a like this nice secret that we of course dont want to be kept secret
2211595 material that doesnt take up shelf space and is available 24 7 thats really attractive for libraries
2211596 since the recording process is instantaneous and the nature of the image such that it cannot survive corrective handwork it is obvious that the finished print must be created in full before the film is exposed
2211597 in contrast to the written account which depending on its complexity of thought reference and vocabulary is pitched at a larger or smaller readership a photograph has only one language and is destined potentially for all
2211598 photographs are perhaps the most mysterious of all objects that make up and thicken the environment we recognize as modern photographs really are experience captured and the camera is the ideal arm of consciousness in its acquisitive mood
2211599 in contrast to the written account which depending on its complexity of thought reference and vocabulary is pitched at a larger or smaller readership a photograph has only one language and is destined potentially for all
2211600 a pretty addition ew ill assume he left a word like good out between those two
2211601 if i knew how to take a good photograph id do it every time
2211602 microsoft as a company has shaped the evolution of the global computing industry over the past 30 years and is poised to play a leading role in the coming decade too i am thrilled to be joining the microsoft india team at such an exciting time
2211603 rajan anandan is a result oriented and goal driven person one reason for the success of dell in india has been certain initiatives he took he is one of the biggest reasons for the way dell is perceived in india he understood the market and brought in localisation his appointment will help microsoft tremendously as currently their objective is to increase pc penetration and reduce piracy level of its solutions this requires out of the box thinking and aggressiveness which he has demonstarted at dell
2211604 i always thought of photography as a naughty thing to do that was one of my favorite things about it and when i first did it i felt very perverse
2211605 when i photograph what im really doing is seeking answers to things
2211606 the demand for antique and estate jewelry is still very strong
2211607 international markets such as russia far east and middle east
2211608 are looking to collect jewelry and are realizing and appreciating jewelry as an art form
2211609 lately there have been less of these pieces on the market
2211610 and as a result the value has shot up to almost double or triple estimates
2211611 with estate jewelry the customer tends to approach the product as a collector rather than a consumer not only as a beautiful object but as something that could appreciate in value over time
2211612 people think they are getting a deal at an auction house
2211613 while merchandise tends to be cheaper people tend to get carried away when it comes to bidding

2211617 ha oui l y de quoi faire un corps fait pour la
2211618 the better i get the more pressure i put on myself to fix the issues
2211619 what ive discovered i like most about photography is what it teaches me i like the experimentation element in fact to me the actual photograph is secondary
2211620 all the arts are based on the presence of man only photography derives an advantage from his absence photography affects us like a phenomenon in nature like a flower or a snowflake whose vegetable or earthly origins are an inseparable part of their beauty
2211621 it is a peculiar part of the good photographers adventure to know where luck is most likely to lie in the stream to hook it and to bring it in without unfair play and without too much subduing it
2211622 its really a process of looking in as well as looking out through the viewfinder
2211623 let the subject generate its own photographs become a camera
2211624 no matter how slow the film spirit always stands still long enough for the photographer it has chosen
2211625 it is a peculiar part of the good photographers adventure to know where luck is most likely to lie in the stream to hook it and to bring it in without unfair play and without too much subduing it
2211626 let the subject generate its own photographs become a camera
2211627 this is what i do and im proud of it
2211628 without significant action either more jobs will be lost through outsourcing abroad or the nations business as a whole will suffer major problems relying on it infrastructures
2211629 hac a dos a os que me ven an persiguiendo para que la hiciera me decid porque creo que hice una transici n en estos ltimos a os ahora estoy encaminada en la actuaci n que es lo que realmente siempre quise hacer en un momento estaba muy expuesta f sicamente me encasillaron mucho y pensaba que no era conveniente hacerlo pero hoy estoy segura de mi posici n como actriz
2211630 me parece que soy joven y si no lo hago ahora no lo hago m s la producci n se hizo en una casa en san telmo reciclada que es divina la tem tica de las fotos tiene que ver con mostrarme pura fresca se ve casi todo y no voy a tener ning n accesorio ni triciclo ni nada
2211631 but then i just decided i would do it they gave me a 10 page spread which they never gave a celebrity before they gave me the right to show whatever i wanted to show it was just a great experience with an amazing magazine i had a great time
2211632 i have a brain i love to think and talk you have to be smart to get ahead in this business nobody is going to hand you anything thats why i tell girls that its so important to have a great education theres a million beautiful girls trying to get into modeling nobody is going to help you you really have to help yourself
2211633 i took some photos from my portfolios and made greeting cards out of them i had photos of me with funny sexy sayings on the inside and i started selling them in los angeles i sold them at stores and it went nationwide that led to modeling jobs and swimsuit issues its not just about beauty its really helpful to have some brains too
2211634 shes too busy dreaming about bad guys and trying to stop them in their tracks

2211693 marc from plrpro wanted me to email my massive email list and see if any of you wanted to join up since a few extra slots opened up they are giving you 72 hours i dont know why to decide if you want to spend 97 on october 1st the doors open again for 197 im a paying member and believe its a good deal
2211694 what is six months and one day in order for my son to die
2211695 seven months down the road everybodys getting their life back together my life is still totally destroyed
2211696 whats this telling the kids on the street you dont like somebody you just kill them
2211697 he stood in that club for no reason and ordered my son to die
2211698 and there my sons laid out in the dirt in a graveyard
2211699 the niceties of the law the peculiarities of the evidence the difficulties of proving a criminal case beyond reasonable doubt and fragility of witnesses
2211700 mr goodson is the person who took mr flacks life
2211701 we seized a pretty good quantity of drugs and probably a couple thousand dollars
2211702 its centrally located there are a lot of low income apartments
2211703 its hard to police because they can see people coming in all directions
2211704 a lot of times it takes a while and you really have to make it look like youre not doing anything in order to get the evidence and be able to make an arrest
2211705 they used to be 20 a pill but with gas prices theyve gone up to 30
2211706 it becomes a social pattern they share with friends and it becomes an epidemic
2211707 a lot of the drug dealers that come up to mercer county are also strongly linked to wyoming and mcdowell counties
2211708 we dont stop at knowing whos dealing the drugs we follow the money
2211709 obviously i was very thrilled i think the health care authority had a very difficult task in reviewing the application but ultimately realized the opportunity we have here
2211710 now we start the hard work we have to make the facility operational put the health care professionals in place and open the doors
2211711 that dollar amount is tied to renovations over a period of time
2211712 basically its whats known in the industry as psych proofing the facility
2211713 you have to make sure its a safe environment for everyone involved
2211714 a lot of those kids are being sent out of state because there simply arent beds in the state
2211715 we will be taking children with limited numbers of diagnoses
2211716 its just such a beautiful facility and this is such a much needed service
2211717 i just think we will be able to give the patients good quality care in a psychiatric nursing hospital
2211718 the board of directors of pch really has supported this project from the very beginning they always envisioned this as one of the opportunities for st lukes
2211719 were starting from scratch we have a nice facility its nestled into the hillside so itll be peaceful here and we just think this is a wonderful opportunity
2211720 we still hope we can get a veterans clinic at the facility we havent given up on that
2211721 support exceptional men and women who are breaking new ground in areas which advance human knowledge and well being
2211722 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off
2211723 at the moment no apps have been blacklisted but by all appearances this had been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for if apple so chooses to shut them down
2211724 every wanna be watergate journalist in the northern hemisphere e mails me with conspiracy theories
2211725 rather than launch mobileme as a monolithic service we could have launched over the air syncing with iphone to begin with followed by the web applications one by one mail first followed 30 days later if things went well with mail by calendar then 30 days later by contacts
2211726 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
2211727 more to learn about internet services and learn we will the vision of mobileme is both exciting and ambitious and we will press on to make it a service we are all proud of by the end of this year
2211728 it was a miscalculation without exception technology companies have botched launches
2211729 why were they able to get itunes right but not this were they just stretched too thin
2211730 maybe they were a little bit too cocky about this it made logical sense to launch mobileme at the same time as the iphone
2211731 dans cette famille on se souvient finalement do lon vient
2211732 well it just so happens that i know two people in prison who dont deserve to be there so the fault must lie with the system
2211733 throughout the first three quarters of this century the nations incarceration rate remained relatively stable at about 110 prison inmates for every 100 000 people the rate is now 445 per 100 000

2211738 this is about not caring for people before it is too late we ignore children then imprison mentally ill adults
2211739 poverty has an easily demonstrable link to crime google it and ignore the heritage foundation hit that comes up first they have a vested interest in the moral arguments about prisoners

2211751 video games pass the time so much easier than just playing cards
2211752 all the guys i know bring a ps2 psp and a controller with them to the international competitions they get into some pretty heated madden tournaments
2211753 olympic track athletes spend a lot of free time trying to be the best in their favorite video games so much so our fingers sometimes get more tired then our legs do in actual races
2211754 for me it keeps me off my feet it keeps me engaged and i dont waste a lot of energy playing them

2211766 jasmin reyes oversees many outdoor weddings for the golden gate national recreation area but one in particular almost literally blew her away
2211767 and the wind was blowing so hard that she had to hang onto her veil the entire ceremony when it came time to kiss the groom she had to let go and at that precise moment it flew off
2211768 our moms who are both native san franciscans were so sure it would be cold and foggy that they thought wed need to bring blankets
2211769 but the weather was perfect we wanted a setting that showcased the city the bay and the golden gate bridge there were some people walking by who stopped to watch but they all cheered at the end and that just added to the celebratory mood it was very san francisco
2211770 but she changed her mind because she was afraid it would be spooked by the wooden planks
2211771 a family of five or six deer grazed in the meadow nearby the sun filtered through the redwoods during the ceremony and the kids couldnt stay away from the koi pond during the reception most of them were splashing in it by the time it was over those are great memories and none of them would have occurred at an indoor wedding the insects little flies that we could have taken care of with citronella candles if wed been prepared were the only down side

2211782 the length of time it takes for a person to receive medical attention can often be the difference between life and death these new rapid response vehicles can not replace a fully equipped ambulance
2211783 instead of announcing cuts in ambulance cover the health minister should have been announcing the introduction of new ambulances to replace those that are too old to be on the road

2211802 were excited to be a part of this evening especially during the dnc
2211803 but the democrats are in control of congress right now and their decision to recess for summer vacation without passing real energy reform is inexcusable with so many families struggling to afford a summer vacation themselves

2211825 if these flyers succeed in changing a few minds and keep a few drink drivers off our roads then they have succeeded
2211826 it is a sad testament that another five drink drivers were caught in darwin last night

2211874 this ruling gets us one big step closer to the puget sound partnerships goal of recovering puget sound by 2020
2211875 the board concludes that the phase i permit fails to require that the municipalities control stormwater discharges to the maximum extent practicable and does not require application of all known available and reasonable methods to prevent and control pollution because it fails to require more extensive use of low impact development techniques
2211876 the question we asked was do we want salmon swimming through the ballard locks in years to come or not
2211877 to our relief the pollution controls hearing board said yes and here is what we will do
2211878 with the future of the sound at stake we need to do everything we can to stop undermining water quality and begin restoring degraded areas
2211879 there are inexpensive and proven ways to stop pollution now through techniques like low impact development instead of relying on the old ways of installing expensive treatment systems at the end of the pipe we are pleased that the board agreed that with us that greater use of these techniques should become the rule not the exception

2211913 our partnership with brussels airlines is particularly good for the clients of both airline companies as our route networks essentially are complementary as opposed to overlapping airbaltic has an excellent range of products in terms of flights to cis countries baltic countries and regional centres in scandinavia while brussels airlines offers attractive destinations in africa
2211914 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions

2211918 right now hes the it guy but hes going to have to do it every snap in practice and getting ready for this game
2211919 hopefully hell grow with the performances he exhibits on the practice field and with his experience in the game on monday hell keep getting better
2211920 in some capacities it works out well because this affords him to take every snap
2211921 i felt at notre dame we went up against a lot of really good teams with a lot of creative aggressive play but at the same time its the next step up
2211922 certainly as a young snapper im anticipating teams gunning for me really trying to see if i have any weaknesses its an opportunity now to really focus on honing my craft
2211923 practice has been tough and ive told them to put the pressure on him and theyve done that
2211924 he obviously has a lot of questions but theyre not questions that are ridiculous he understands what his job is hes been doing it a bunch of years in high school a bunch of years in college and hes very efficient

2211952 unprecendented levels of skills with information technology that they take technology for granted that they want more of it in their classes that postsecondary institutions arent responding fast enough to meet their needs
2211953 moving beyond basic activities is problematic it appears they do not recognize the enhanced functionality of the applications they own and use
2211954 significant further training in the use of information technology in support of learning and problem solving skills

2211978 however we have a clear preference that any new hydro developments should be on rivers that already have hydro schemes on them to avoid altering virgin rivers
2211979 i think its a very important point to make that if we do identify a project that we would like to advance the first steps will be to discuss it with local communities
2211980 the role of new large scale hydro projects will be particularly important in an environment in which there is growing concern around climate change and sustainability and in which traditional thermal fuels such as gas are becoming increasingly expensive

2211998 we really are set to have a second century of leading the country in producing energy
2211999 thats going to continue to be a very important part of our economy
2212000 but even with our rich natural resources most of our citizens are still feeling the pinch of the high cost of gas but with innovators in our state on the job working to create new ways to help oklahomans get the most out of a gallon of gas and developing alternatives our state is on the right track to help our nation reduce its reliance on foreign oil from overseas dictators
2212001 in washington its about winners and losers and good or bad its not about what works
2212002 in the end americans are interested in what works what will give us the most abundant supply
2212003 the fact that the american people are telling us to put all the options on the table and come up with the right mix i think thats enormous in a lot of areas were not that far away from solutions
2212004 lea t hampton is going broke glam town 12m in the hole
2212005 everybody perceives east hampton to be the home of the rich and famous

2212014 the u s supports georgias desire to bring its pro russian separatist regions under control but russia has military plans to stop any move by georgia to secure these regions
2212015 russias long history of border wars and its desire to reclaim the resources of satellite states lost upon the collapse of the u
2212016 when they walk into a former lasalle banking center it will look and feel like a bank of america banking center
2212017 we just have to make sure its the right guy
2212018 karmically we deserve the right guy its a tough thing man we make a pretty big noise
2212019 die ums tze waren allerdings einem freitagabend entsprechend relativ niedrig
2212020 it made for some pretty intense games of backyard hockey
2212021 its awesome just being here with him i actually didnt even realize id been drafted back in june because i was skating in a workout at the university of north dakota i got a text message from travis saying that id been drafted by the islanders and that he had been as well
2212022 we always had a ton of kids over at my house skating on the backyard rink
2212023 our house was like a community center the entire neighborhood would be over playing in a pickup game we always had a pretty high level of play just within the backyard now being on the ice together again its just been a lot of fun to relive old times
2212024 when we were younger and in school we would go back to davids house for lunch and shoot pucks in his backyard rink that mightve even been the reason we showed up late for school every once in a while im always over at their house and hanging out when im there its just me david and jon and when were hanging out its not really like im with the jonathan toews the nhl player
2212025 and they were razzing us a little bit over which of us would go first since we were ranked right in the same area but we werent really too worried about who went first or second
2212026 we urge all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2212027 we are working on mediation efforts to secure a cease fire and we are urging the parties to restart their dialogue
2212028 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2212029 what we heard is that the state department and the entire administration is deeply concerned and that they are heavily engaged with russia trying to de escalate the situation
2212030 what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2212031 to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
2212032 all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia
2212033 its a very important dinner for them they want everyone to know they are still in love
2212034 whats unique is they give birth to live young theres not many invertebrates that do that
2212035 its great to be able to study it here where its found
2212036 after the impact and ending up upside down i couldnt believe i was alive
2212037 im lucky the machine was designed to take the impact and crumple around the cockpit
2212038 that terrible screeching and tearing sound is something ill never forget
2212039 around town youve got powerlines with three wires and poles making them visible but swer lines are spaced out over very long distances with poles that are hard to find
2212040 consequently if a pilot happens to forget about it it becomes a life threatening problem
2212041 one of the reasons we chose these planes is because theyve got a very strong cockpit structure
2212042 everything else might be ripped and torn except the cockpit so tony was able to get himself out of it
2212043 the last couple of years have really slowed everything up things have been a bit dry and financially constrained so we dont know what well be doing at this time
2212044 we rally here today in front of liz penfolds office to ask her to agitate the government

2212047 the reserve is highly valued by local residents for its native vegetation bird life and for the open space and playground areas
2212048 council has found that to continue to provide the current level of services it must increase rates by 5 per cent
2212049 an increase in line with cpi would have been insufficient to meet the needs of the community
2212050 the collection rate for a 140 litre refuse bin has gone up from 103 to 123 and the 240 litre bin from 180 to 210
2212051 the tumby bay oval rate paid by ratepayers in the tumby bay township and hundred of hutchinson has risen by cpi
2212052 council has taken into account the request by the oval committee and representation made to the electors meeting and decided to review the rate next year when water from the proposed upgrade of the community waste water management scheme is available for use on the oval
2212053 i was elected to the group at a public meeting and i made it clear i may be the devils advocate and i thought that would have ensured good healthy debate
2212054 i resigned because the group was not prepared to debate i was told were not there to debate the issue just to do everything possible to prevent it
2212055 not everything coming out of the cag is agreed with by the rest of the committee
2212056 the logic im putting forward for a compromise is if centrex arent allowed to get started because theres no port to ship from the other companies gearing up and spending a lot of money will pull the pin
2212057 i dont believe the state government would let that happen
2212058 the alternative is leaving it in the ground until the ports built then the port wont ever get built
2212059 im a great believer the port should be built somewhere between tumby bay and port neill as a multi use port and i believe eventually most of eyre peninsulas grain would go out through that port and eliminate trucks going through port lincoln
2212060 we respected his point of view and encouraged him to present it to council
2212061 its a good thing in that we didnt want to spend these meetings debating something we had gone past

2212066 gt take my advice better listen to him hes pre med i think the hardest thing about being an advice columnist would be that whole part where you have to stop laughing long enough to write the column being an advice columnist has to be like winning the west virginia primary at the end of the day just how excited can you be that 65 of the dumbest people in the country think youre the one who can solve their problems theres a pretty good case to be made for making advice columns illegal after all theyre an attempt to thwart the smooth natural functioning of a darwinian world if were really concerned about the kind of world were going to leave to our kids we should probably be less concerned about global warming and more concerned that stupid people are no longer being weeded out of the gene pool heres an example of a question posed to amy dickinson dear amy i am a 21 year old woman in a relationship with a man who is 16 years my senior in the beginning of this relationship it was fine now i find that he is really mean to me 94 percent of the time he calls me names talks down to me and condemns the way i look it seems that nothing makes this man happy and i am at my wits end in the two years that we have been together we have gone nowhere together he refused to acknowledge my birthday and valentines day he constantly tells me that i am a loser and that i will never amount to anything he does not allow me to go out and have fun and any money that comes into our household goes to him he also believes that i should keep quiet and take whatever he dishes out i am not entitled to an opinion i have heard him say sexual things to other women including his wife i had no idea she even existed he is now divorced or that he has three children i have asked him to please try and be caring sensitive and loving and to stop lying to me but he refuses to do so in spite of these things i really love him and plan to marry him but im not sure stupid love lets recap despite being well aware of her boyfriends lying cheating thieving and abusive nature shes planning on marrying him if only she can get rid of a few nagging doubts the dude is mean to her 94 of the time which is a pretty amazing feat since you have to figure all that yelling and cheating on your girlfriend is pretty tiring so the guy probably is asleep at least 25 of the time if were going to outlaw fatty foods because obesity costs society money we should take a hard look at outlawing stupidity also you can pretty much guarantee that if stupid love doesnt take amys advice shes going to be running up one hell of a social services bill heck there are probably five or six cops alone thatll retire on the overtime generated by the domestic disturbance calls in the spirit of giving back to the community ive decided to volunteer my services as an advice columnist i think its time for a new breed of advice column lets call it tough love with mark jabo my motto it may not be great advice but at least youll know where i stand how about a practice letter dear mark jabo as im writing this letter to you my shirt is on fire what should i do its my favorite shirt and has lots of sentimental value because my mother bought it for me please help because its really starting to get hot and my skin is melting off dear c squared if youre still breathing when you get this advice quickly make out a will and leave everything you own to me you failed to mention what caused the fire was it grease or did your polyester shirt break into flames as you were trying to light your water pipe either way you should probably drop and roll on the floor or have someone try to smother the flames with a blanket good luck dont forget that last will and testament do you see what we did there there was some solid practical advice but because it came with a cost attached to it crispy critter will think twice the next time before wearing a polyester shirt take my advice amp linktype misc

2212083 unfortunately the world community is still far away from this goal
2212084 they can either continue with business as usual which costs an estimated 1 000 deaths each day due to gun violence or in the alternative reach legally binding agreements to restrain the illicit trade
2212085 not only do these weapons prolong violent conflicts but their uncontrolled spread also poses a grave danger to long term stability and development both domestically and within the region as a whole
2212086 that can only be tackled if all countries work together with common guidelines across the world

2212094 he said i need to have britney to be involved in the coparenting of the kids but i need there to be a structure
2212095 nobody could have anticipated the terms of events that have occurred this was a two year journey that will be halted at a point that is good for these children custody is always modifiable if there is a final order it means there is nothing to try

2212121 i just pulled out of my driveway and i was going down kind of a cul de sac road that i live on
2212122 it had rained all night and it was slick it was a manual car and i just shifted maybe a little too quick and hit a pole going about 35 miles an hour
2212123 today i didnt feel like i hit the ball very well but i was able to get it around the course
2212124 if i had hit it like this a month ago i probably wouldve finished a few over
2212125 i said to the chinese leadership that on questions of human rights of religious freedom of tibet of internet freedom that these continue to be concerns that we would continue to prosecute these concerns both through the discussions we have just had and through the bilateral human rights dialogue which lies ahead between australia and china
2212126 there are exciting prospects for us all for the future
2212127 if we have come this far in 25 years how much further can we go in the next 25 years
2212128 georgian forces are controlling the entire territory of south ossetia except java
2212129 this information will be checked but this is the approximate number based on information from relatives

2212133 ambulances cannot move hospitals are reported to be overflowing surgery is taking place in corridors
2212134 if this is not war then i wonder what is
2212135 there is a threat of even more large scale russian aggression against georgia georgia faces an existential threat amid russian aggression
2212136 they have in effect begun hostilities using tanks and artillery
2212137 there should be only one ossetia we want to live with our brothers
2212138 now we see georgia has found a use for these weapons and for the special forces that were trained with the help of international instructors
2212139 over 30 state governors wrote a letter to the president saying that they depended on gambling revenue in their states if the federal government took 4 percent off the top to fund its own programs it would put each state in dire straits
2212140 these events sent a message to the casino industry that it should be represented in washington
2212141 given the size of our business it is crucial for us to work with stable software providers with a flexible business operation our casino is a core part of our offering hence it is very satisfying to have sealed a strategic partnership with net entertainment the casinomodule will not only provide us with market leading games but also with a state of the art back end management system this will give us the competitive edge we need to take our business to a new level
2212142 we promised swift action to take cryptologic to the next level of online gaming and our new relationships with leading brands such as the gaming media group show that we are executing on our plan
2212143 gaming media groups commitment to promote the games through advertising means new profile for cryptologic products that takes them to new people and new places
2212144 im actually using them for a release of nervous energy
2212145 you just get so tired sometimes but you know when you sign up to do something thats part of the territory so its pretty much a learning experience
2212146 my caddie said we played with tiger in the u
2212147 the most important thing to learn about a major championship is to stay patient
2212148 if you hit a bad shot youve got to take your medicine
2212149 theres not going to be many scores under par definitely not in the afternoon
2212150 its all about staying patient for the first three days and i need to get my head around that
2212151 the monster after he won the 1951 u s open the official distance then was 6 927 yards and only was stretched by 47 yards to 6 974 on the scorecard when the sixth and most recent u s open was held here in 1996
2212152 seventeen that was a 5 or 6 iron in the ryder cup now its as good a 3 iron as i can hit or a cutting 5 wood and the ninth that was 262 yards in practice so i guess its a par 4
2212153 i noticed they have given us a bit of fairway short of 17 and nine so if you want you can lay up
2212154 a big 3 wood to get to nine and a good 3 wood to get to 17 he said
2212155 thats a lot of holes theyre supposed to be short holes right isnt that what a par 3 is short
2212156 i think azinger made a good move in the changing instead of having all the picks monday morning watch a few weeks and see who is really playing better
2212157 we thought there must be other ladies out there who want to play with other ladies
2212158 we just want to have fun meet friends and get a good workout
2212159 it was said best during the british open telecast the guy is the best player in the world he does win a lot but he doesnt win them all
2212160 when tiger isnt playing obviously the tv ratings are going to take a hit
2212161 when tiger is in the field its a lot harder to win he said
2212162 i had a lot of issues maybe i thought i was too good i didnt feel like i needed to practice i didnt think anyone else was good
2212163 the respect i have for them has grown now i work to get respect for my golf game putting in the time obviously makes you feel like you earned something
2212164 the fun part is figuring how this all fits into apples strategy as not just a maker of computers but also as a seller and distributor of entertainment content
2212165 the ntt chip is not just an h 264 decoder it encodes too which is what makes it so special the last i heard nhk was claiming the chip could compress a 1080p video and audio stream into four megabits per second down from the 20 megabits normally required if we assume apple will apply the same kind of wink wink nudge nudge transcoding to 1080p that theyve already applied to 720p in the apple tv then it is within reason to expect theyll claim to distribute 1080p over itunes in two megabits per second

2212169 the holy spirit will come upon you and the power of the most high will overshadow you
2212170 the overshadowing of mary recalls the cloud that covered with glory the meeting tent ex 40 34f and the temple of the lord 1 kgs 8 10 hg 2 7
2212171 because there is no specific connection of the canticle to the context of marys pregnancy and her visit to elizabeth the magnificat with the possible exception of v 48 may have been a jewish christian hymn that luke found appropriate at this point in his story even if not composed by luke it fits in well with themes found elsewhere in luke
2212172 only in recent decades have some biblical scholars asserted that mary could not have composed the magnificat herself it is worth noting that for nearly 2 000 years christians had no difficulty in crediting mary with the ability to understand her religious tradition and its scripture and to praise god in terms expressive of them
2212173 not to put too fine a point on it a wretched translation it succeeds in being at the same time loose stilted breezy vulgar opaque and relentlessly averse to literary grace
2212174 some people god has designated in the church to be first apostles second prophets third teachers then mighty deeds then gifts of healing assistance administration and varieties of tongues
2212175 judges are called gods in the sense of possessing godlike power or of taking gods place in pronouncing judgment
2212176 gods the bible sometimes understands pagan gods to be lesser divine beings who are assigned by israels god to rule the foreign nations here they are accused of injustice permitting the human judges under their patronage to abuse the righteous

2212183 non ho un barlume di simpatia per chi parla dal punto di vista del culto organizzato le religioni non sono altro che corporation strumenti di potere politico e finanziario senza relazione con il dio che professano di servire si travestono con costumi bislacchi per dispensare precetti e causare guerre non ho allevato nessuno dei miei figli secondo le tradizioni ebraiche e non so neppure quando cadono le feste sono un antisemita no penso solo che il mondo sarebbe assai migliore senza religione

2212234 weve got architects with experience in childcare centres drawing up plans to get the building suitable and to comply with docs nsw department of community services
2212235 were going through the licensing now and hopefully in eight to 12 weeks well have some children running around in there again weve spoken to the former staff and received a positive response most are interested in coming back
2212236 while we dont have a lot of child care industry experience we were inspired by the kindy our children attended here and want to recreate something like that
2212237 it was a small centre but it was a wonderland and every in every nook and cranny was something for the kids to discover they loved going there and loved the people in charge they came home happy and energised all the time
2212238 johns river a liveable and vibrant village with a cohesive and functioning heart well into the future
2212239 our main motivation was making certain johns river could become the village it used to be serving the local community with a real village centre
2212240 drawing on its proximity to four national parks and its unique location as gateway to the manning and hastings districts
2212241 there is still a lot of work to do and i have faith in the community to make the right decisions on how it wishes to progress
2212242 im excited about how this area is up for the energy challenge that is in front of us
2212243 the hot topic is climate change i want to be part of seeing how that impacts our economy resources and the environment everything from how to boil water to international climate change its a fascinating topic of our time
2212244 the renewable energy industry doesnt have a strong voice in the federal parliament its mining and big dollars talking over the next five years were going to be setting renewable energy targets i want to be mr solar mr solar thermal mr renewable and challenge those coal and mining dollars
2212245 the camden haven in particular when it comes to gps is borderline crisis because of policies at a national level the area doesnt get the subsidies for gps that others do with similar demographics and theres no good reason why laurieton kendall wauchope and port macquarie are getting a raw deal
2212246 the advice i kept getting was that it was a decision i had to make within myself and in the end it comes down to a gut feeling and my guts been right in the past
2212247 i enjoy representing a community first not a political party and im hopeful people have seen my track record of that at state level
2212248 any of the parties of consideration are in opposition for the next five years we need to have access to government to have outcomes when the tap gets turned off weve got to look for options to turn the tap on to federal funding
2212249 if we look at it in balance i think the glasshouse will become a very small issue with all the projects weve delivered for the community in my time in local government which covers about nine years
2212250 weve delivered some great outcomes for our community and i intend to continue to do that
2212251 weve got the upgrade of the airport now weve got virgin airlines coming in and weve just had an announcement from qantas that they can bring their larger planes in now
2212252 i believe the outcomes weve delivered for the community will outweigh those negatives
2212253 i think the grounding ive had in local government will certainly put me in great stead that will be a real strength i will take into this campaign
2212254 rob drew made no bones about it hes quite proud hes had a role in delivering the best facility on the north coast for those cultural and entertainment acts to bring them into the region and also to bring a lot more visitors into the region and to create jobs for local people
2212255 he put it to the meeting that he was elected to take tough decisions it was a tough decision it is going to cost ratepayers money but it is going to deliver into the future for the local community very strongly obviously the preselectors did not think that was any sort of a black mark on his record in fact it was actually a tick heres a guy who can actually take the tough decisions and can deliver for local people
2212256 i would rather trust rob drew in this position than i would morris iemma remember morris iemma is the person that sacked the council here without cause and without base
2212257 the administrator has come into this council and changed nothing everything is being completed as was planned by the council so that tells me there was nothing wrong with it
2212258 if i want someone representing me in the federal parliament i would rather have rob drew than morris iemma

2212296 it came about as a suggestion from uss new hampshire commissioning committee vice chairman doug bates
2212297 i thought it was a fun idea to have a beer produced in honor of the event
2212298 naming a beer is not an easy thing to do and we didnt think it was appropriate for any single person or group to come up with so it just made logical sense to put it in front of the commander and the crew
2212299 and i guess they had a great time doing it
2212300 we get a lot of requests from private people to do special beers and we say no to virtually all of them
2212301 but we thought this one had a lot of merit and it was worth pursuing

2212316 i think the budget process is one of the most important things the council does and i have a lot of experience doing that

2212329 may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail sea air postal telegraphic radio and other means of communication and the severance of diplomatic relations
2212330 call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures
2212331 agreed yesterday to seek new sanctions against iran over its nuclear program after the country failed to meet a weekend deadline to respond to an offer
2212332 we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
2212333 calling on the administration to focus on the urgency of the iranian threat and to impose tougher sanctions on tehran
2212334 to enhance united states diplomatic efforts with respect to iran by imposing additional economic sanctions against iran and for other purposes
2212335 authorize s state and local governments to direct divestiture from and prevent investment in companies with investments of 20 000 000 or more in irans energy sector
2212336 support ing israels quest for peace and press ing the arab states to do more to support israeli palestinian talks
2212337 the radical regime in iran has sponsored terrorism against the united states israel and the west for decades
2212338 the worlds leading state sponsor of terror noting its support for groups such as hamas hizballah and islamic jihad
2212339 insurgency in iraq supplied arms to the taliban and hosted al qaeda terrorists
2212340 relentlessly pursu es nuclear weapons and thus is a particularly implacable and lethal regime
2212341 only a sustained unified international effort to isolate and sanction iran is likely to convince it to give up these dangerous activities
2212342 speaking from the heart as a true friend of israel when i visit with aipac i am among friends good friends who share my strong commitment that the bond between the united states and israel is unbreakable today tomorrow and forever
2212343 by israel in the face of all threats speak s up when israels security is at risk and voices concern that americas recent foreign policy hasnt made israel more secure hamas now controls gaza hizbollah has tightened its grip on southern lebanon and is flexing its muscles in beirut because of the war in iraq iran which always posed a greater threat to israel than iraq is emboldened and poses the greatest strategic challenge to the us and israel in the middle east in a generation we must isolate hamas syria continues its support for terror and meddling in lebanon and pursu es weapons of mass destruction there is no greater threat to israel or to the peace and stability of the region than iran it supports violent extremists pursues a nuclear capability and threatens to wipe israel off the map my goal will be to eliminate this threat
2212344 foremost in his mind is the threat posed by the regime in tehran the iranian president calls israel a stinking corpse it uses violence to undermine israel in the middle east peace process it supports extremists in iraq killing american soldiers remains the worlds chief sponsor of terrorism and its pursuit of nuclear weapons poses an unacceptable risk a danger we cannot allow
2212345 the most dangerous regime in the middle east characterized by its cruel despotism and fanatic militancy if this regime acquires nuclear weapons this would presage catastrophic consequences not only for my country not only for the middle east but for all of mankind the fact that iran is building nuclear weapons is beyond question and they may be the worlds first un deterable nuclear power so the danger is clear and the question is what do we do about it my message to you is divest iran
2212346 iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium so the security council has no choice but to increase the sanctions
2212347 national tragedy demagogically justified an economic catastrophe a regional disaster and a global boomerang for the united states
2212348 a historic strategic and moral calamity undertaken under false assumptions it is undermining americas global legitimacy tarnishing our moral credentials and intensifying regional instability
2212349 plausible scenario for a military collision with iran based on iraqi failure to meet the benchmarks followed by accusations of iranian responsibility for the failure then by some provocation in iraq or a terrorist act in the us blamed on iran culminating in a defensive us military action
2212350 a lonely america into a spreading and deepening quagmire eventually ranging across iraq iran afghanistan and pakistan
2212351 when the president flatly asserts iran is seeking nuclear weapons hes overstating the facts we have very scant supportive evidence and after the iraq calamity he should be very careful about the veracity of his public assertions
2212352 if his secretary of state is joe lieberman and his secretary of defense is rudy giuliani we will be moving towards the ww iv counting the cold war as ww iii that they have been both favoring and predicting an appalling concept
2212353 the us did not give the green light for an israeli attack on iran george bush made it clear to all parties that the first option is diplomacy
2212354 it is the absolute responsibility of everybody in uniform to disobey an order that is either illegal or immoral
2212355 not obey illegal and immoral orders to use weapons of mass destruction they cannot commit crimes against humanity
2212356 if sanctions and incentives cannot be made to work the voices for military action will only get louder no matter what aides may be telling mr bush and mr olmert or what they may be telling each other an attack on iran would be a disaster
2212357 israel will almost surely attack irans nuclear sites in the next four to seven months conventionally
2212358 assault fail to significantly harm or stall the iranian program a nuclear attack will most likely follow
2212359 only one option if it wishes to halt irans march toward nuclear weaponry the military
2212360 which leaves only israel the country threatened almost daily with destruction by irans leaders irans leaders would do well to rethink their gamble and suspend their nuclear program
2212361 will destroy their nuclear facilities even though this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation
2212362 the nuclear incineration of 70 million iranians and the contamination of the better part of a billion people in the middle east asia and europe
2212363 that appeared to be a rehearsal for a potential bombing attack
2212364 escalating tensions that would peak with an iranian inspired insurgency strike against us
2212365 generations of jihadists and our grandchildren will be battling them in america
2212366 at least ten senior flag and general officers including combatant commanders
2212367 christ would not vote for barack obama because barack obama has voted to behave in a way that it is inconceivable for christ to have behaved
2212368 obamas on record as lets kill the baby if thats what the mother wants
2212369 republicans are gearing up campaigns to depict mr obama as a radical on the question of abortion because as a state senator in illinois he opposed a ban on the killing of foetuses born alive
2212370 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let him down
2212371 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2212372 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2212373 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2212374 we were given just a little rice by a private aid group from yangon i dont know where the government or foreign organizations are helping people but not here
2212375 the vast majority of families simply dont have enough to eat
2212376 but very few people have received enough assistance to get them through the next three months and almost no one has received enough assistance to enable them to rebuild their lives
2212377 the message i want the world to know is that the government u n agencies and other organizations are making good progress
2212378 she says she would like to be able to afford a pig
2212379 this woman sits in the middle of a very fast moving story about the way the whole global food system operates
2212380 and how its changing and changing very fast driven by a variety of factors colliding at the same time
2212381 shes got enough to feed herself and her daughter has a cash income in the city
2212382 but even she could be pushed into difficulty if she couldnt afford the seeds to plant and hold on to the fragile livelihood shes secured for herself
2212383 she was surprised at all the motorbikes and the nice shops
2212384 she said she would like to live there but at her age its hard to change
2212385 we are confident that we can ensure the safety of these games
2212386 through our strong intelligence agencies and close cooperation with foreign intelligence agencies we have already obtained information about some terrorist activities
2212387 what good are the olympics if they cannot be safe
2212388 every measure has been taken to stage safe and secure games
2212389 but the ioc is always insistent that the need to ensure security not hinder the festive spirit essential to the games success
2212390 but once you are here and see how beautiful everything is you are glad they are taking these measures it is an inconvenience yes but a necessary one
2212391 what matters to me is how the court overall is perceived and how if it was not kwame kilpatrick sitting in that seat if it was john six pack sitting in that seat what would i do and that answer is simple

2212424 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

2212426 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2212427 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2212428 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2212429 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

2212445 the coalition believes it has become imperative to move for impeachment
2212446 the stark revelations of the last few days have reminded us yet again that we have terrorists in our midst still planning awful deeds
2212447 we must therefore never relax our vigilance against these extremists
2212448 reinforces the need to confront the terrorists to work with our allies to bring them to justice and to prevent such attacks from happening again

2212470 youll joyously soak the seats and people in front of you in the theater with your man chowder
2212471 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2212472 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2212473 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2212474 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2212475 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2212476 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2212477 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2212478 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2212479 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2212480 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2212481 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2212482 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2212483 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2212484 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2212485 listen im 45 years old and for the past 30 years ive taken a 15 inch neck
2212486 okay ill do it but you do know what happens when the neck is too small
2212487 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2212488 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2212489 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2212490 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2212491 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2212492 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2212493 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2212494 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2212495 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2212496 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2212497 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2212498 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2212499 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2212500 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

2212503 i remember when i was nine months pregnant with my daughter jean i was cleaning floors with my big belly
2212504 i have to say that over the past 13 years all of my efforts have been to prove i can do better
2212505 and when you look at the olympics you can see the chinese government making a similar effort to show the world that we are doing better
2212506 on the surface it appeared that i was poorer less educated but that created desire a feeling that i can be as tall as you i can do anything as good as you
2212507 i did not think id come back until i realized the opportunities were here
2212508 if i had been born in australia or the united states i doubt very much i would have had the same level of variety in my life or the same desire the same drive for success
2212509 i believe part of the reason i have achieved so much is the life i have been through
2212510 at this stage of my life i dont have to prove myself anymore
2212511 the past 13 years have all been work work work not much quality of life

2212517 the republican agenda has set us back decades were going to make a statement against that on sept 1
2212518 we want people to feel free to bring their kids their moms their dads their sisters and their brothers this is an opportunity for people to literally step onto the stage of history and speak out against the war
2212519 i dont think of them as a threat i think of them as citizens who want to operate within their first amendment rights theyre coming to st paul to make sure their voices are heard i dont see them as a threat
2212520 if we put them in the 12th row of seats in the xcel energy center they would complain that they werent in the 2nd row
2212521 tom walsh can say what tom walsh says and the city of st paul can say what the city of st paul says but we have a right to speak out against the war and the city has stood in our way of doing that
2212522 disorderly conduct is disorderly conduct criminal damage to property is criminal damage to property assault is assault if nobody is breaking the law then there are no issues
2212523 i have no idea whether or not the st paul police have infiltrated any of the organizations that are apart of the coalition or not there is a level of surveillance i know that for a fact
2212524 i guess were not going to discuss that exactly what we know in terms of what preparation may have gone on or may be going on were not going to talk about right now
2212525 we understand that there are going to be many other protests that day and over the four days we think that its very important for people to speak out and make a statement against the republican agenda and against the war
2212526 as much conversation as theres been about the law enforcement resources what we really want to say here is this is going to be a great event its going to be a safe event
2212527 australias formation will be very similar to that of the ivory coast

2212537 at yet another volatile meeting of the pcrc longtime activist spike moss shot up out of his chair and faced off with another veteran community leader ron edwards
2212538 the group was debating whether edwards and american indian activist clyde bellecourt should be ousted as co chairs
2212539 with his voice rising moss accused edwards of withholding information and not supporting the groups platform
2212540 finally he screamed youre not going to stab us in the back and be a chair
2212541 when i first saw the proposal in the potential settlement of the black officers suit i thought here we go again with another police community relations type thing
2212542 the pcrc seems to many to have become a distraction it has set up a parallel structure that interferes with the ability of the mayor and police to do their job i dont hear anyone arguing that its been a success in reducing crime
2212543 people are starting to question whether there is a civil rights solution to every issue the cure to many problems in the african american community does not just lie in more affirmative action or quotas in hiring more black police officers or teachers or in diversity training for white people african american leaders should challenge the community to take full advantage of the opportunities that do exist and should also be willing to challenge it when its members engage in inappropriate destructive behavior
2212544 enough the phony leaders dead end movements and culture of failure that are undermining black america and what we can do about it
2212545 over 50 goals have been accomplished that were not there before
2212546 types who have made a living from claiming racism and now see their livelihoods threatened

2212550 ya know ya know when you stop at the gas station on your early morning commute and fill up your 40 mpg vehicle and the guy you see every morning making the same 45 mile commute driving his jet black humvee with vanity plates that read
2212551 one thing i cant understand is the so called leaderships lack of outrage with black on black crime
2212552 no politician is going to blame their constituants for creating their own problems no one likes to be told the solutions to their problems are within their reach or that the cause of said problems is their own people want to blame others and have the problems solved for them its the same reason you dont hear politicians telling americans to control their spending
2212553 whats with the juvinile toilet humor mickey blaine are you 8 years old
2212554 not only do i find obama to be a bit pompous and pretentious but i find many of his supporters to be that way as well
2212555 the city council voted unanimously tuesday to place a moratorium on new fast food restaurants in an impoverished swath of the city with a proliferation of such eateries and above average rates of obesity
2212556 think the whiners are the jessie jackson spike moss and al sharpton types who have made a living from claiming racism and now see their livelihoods threatened
2212557 one thing i cant understand is the so called leaderships lack of outrage with black on black crime
2212558 it shouldnt surprise you no politician is going to blame their constituants for creating their own problems
2212559 the best thing the police department can do to help relations with all the communities is to put beat cops back on the street on foot
2212560 a g wasnt it phil gramm that said that and was then tossed out of mccains campaign staff to appease the whinners
2212561 should be the campaign slogan written on the side of the bus

2212570 someone please explain whats this with mullets and freeze pops
2212571 dont fret none about that ike greg63 likes me plenty and it doesnt do anything for me
2212572 greg63 is alluding to the myth that bikers scooter trash are bad asses and can make someone disapear permanently when we all know that bikers scooter trash are nothing without their leather and bad hygene
2212573 but in the interest of blog peace ill take back the statement that gregs mom fit me into her busy schedule the other day for some
2212574 why in the heck would you want to run a guy on a bike over unless you did something to provoke getting your butt kicked and he just happened to have a bike
2212575 not to mention that when you tried to get away the spark plug in your yugo failed and your escape plan was trashed
2212576 ya know the difference between a harley and a vacuum cleaner you can get 2 dirt bags on a harley
2212577 at least i know why she keeps wanting stockpiles of diapers around
2212578 did you ever stop and think maybe he did something to provoke me but i guess you failed to grasp the sarcassm
2212579 taking a dump for me is not relaxation nor is it stimulating i sh t because i have to
2212580 what makes you think i have a scooter greg this insulting circle is fun and enjoyable but only if the insults make sense
2212581 like your crack about freezing my balls to my scooter is stupid
2212582 the fbi would be lucky to have you working as an interrogator
2212583 greg this is a picture of me and my yugo
2212584 er docs do it too but say texting while walking driving can be hazardous
2212585 mark just like bms website i got a sore on my mouth about a week after i visited gregs
2212586 finally visited your myspace page greg id like to appologize for everything i said about you youre obviously a man who deserves respect
2212587 mark just like bms website i got a sore on my mouth about a week after i visited gregs
2212588 if you think there is something coooool about a 45 year old with a myspace page not to mention 20 friends well then good for you ahahahahahaha aaaaaaahahahahahaha
2212589 not many people respect you do they markie i only say that because youre very quick to suggest what is and is not the proper way for a person to behave youre confident that you can determine cool or not cool funny or not so funny and what determines the best behavior of someone my age
2212590 and i will also say this embracing of rap has only enhanced the separation from societal norms its only the rappers and the music executive who get rich the rest end up dead shot dead by some punk with his paints down around his knees and holding the gun sideways as he shoots
2212591 to not deal with the disproportionate way it hits black america is doing a disservice to the issue and a disservice to black america
2212592 i was at the mpls car show last year looking at hummers the denny hecker salesman said they could customize the hummer to do anything anything my wife asked him to customize it to get 20 mpg he was stumped i laughed right in his face
2212593 i dont think its cool but a few friends asked me to join up since they live rather far away
2212594 why should something like this even be allowed to be settled out of court
2212595 the notice doesnt preclude the possibility of a future settlement a trial date has been set for october 2009
2212596 a family whose house was raided by police in error is outraged that eight officers involved were honored
2212597 was wondering if this is true and you actually dont think its cool and it really is just a means for you to communicate with your friends from far away why did you link it to your name so the rest of us could see it
2212598 for go to appreciate the barn and because i dont have an issue with people seeing me which apparently you do
2212599 ive always found it interesting that people who are the most confrontational never seem to want to let others see them
2212600 do you have an issue with letting people see who you are seeing part s of your life
2212601 now maybe you can share why having a myspace page is inappropriate for someone who is 45 is it just an opinion if so how did you formulate it would using linkedin or spoke be more appropriate
2212602 no if i was a teenie bopper at heart id have a myspace page to and then id display it in all its glory
2212603 hey man its your life do what you want like i said i could give a flying f k if you take me seriously or not i dont need approval from you to get through the day and im not sure why you care if i think youre just a geek with a myspace page and a ponytail
2212604 if it didnt matter then why did you make it an issue for youself
2212605 as far as knowing who you are all ive ever read is that you dabble in commercial real estate ride a scooter seek attention want to have sex with peoples mothers and have multiple personalities that said id hope theres much more to you than that but youve never provided anything else
2212606 one last thing this is a funny thing to say for a guy who posts a link to his myspace page a guy who likes to share his life with everyone couldnt be seeking attention could he nahhhhh
2212607 i can barely handle the challenges i have now what would i have done faced with hardship like that
2212608 i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live
2212609 nobly sacrifices his life on the guillotine to save the husband of the woman he loves
2212610 but as our greatest stories teach men and women may be deeply imperfect and yet cling tenaciously to a code of conduct they know in their hearts to be right
2212611 mark after years of listen to that dribble and believing it you come to find out it just isnt so
2212612 just like al if al really cared about the damn environment hed be living in a frigidaire box instead he has a huge house a jet plane and new boat
2212613 in reality women are cold calculating manipulating cruel and merciless
2212614 the carter strategy for afgahnistan was to boycott the moscow olympics and impose a grain embargo
2212615 brzezinski he signed an executive directive to have aid given via the cia to the afghan rebels in july of 79
2212616 one thing though we would not be in this energy mess and dealing with the so called climate change had we stuck to his plan of alternative energy research and developement
2212617 i also give him high praise for the mideast peace accord between israel and egypt
2212618 he put solar pannels on the white house which regan later removed what a guy
2212619 i think men need to keep their minds clear this is why i recommend abstaining from strong drink or narcotics this is extremely difficult of course if a woman is involved in your life
2212620 obama ordered pancakes signed menus and greeted patrons at the copper dome restaurant in st paul
2212621 lets talk about people who hate local restaurants and panckes and prefer the grand slam egg specials at national chains
2212622 yeah if youre in a home when the show is over do they wheel you over to the staring window
2212623 mndot fired pitt for misusing state money by taking personal trips violating state ethics policies embarrassing the agency and abusing her state paid cell phone
2212624 at the donner resturant chain i hear the ribs are to die for
2212625 they dont need to be out of the way for me to enjoy them i like a place where i can get a bloody marry read the paper and watch a ball game while i eat my steak and eggs that usually means a bar atmosphere
2212626 am i the only one who got the hidden meaning of the obama at dennys comment
2212627 doesnt it seem a little over the top to equate recreational drug use and sexual promiscuity with murder and cannibalism
2212628 im curious why you would choose me to follow around on the blog you dont comment very much but when you do it often seems to be directed at how tall i am why is that
2212629 no u r incorrect little britches i dont need to hide behind a different moniker to comment on a opinionated half man
2212630 tiny i dont understand your reference to ward churchill i just looked him up and i dont see the connection could you explain please
2212631 if you like i will build you a bigger soap box so can look people in the eye when you squeak out your self absorbing speil
2212632 pretty lame big bomber short jokes and now this if youre not going to give a better effort whats the point
2212633 whats the point as i said earlier i like to make fun of dbags
2212634 feel free after all does anything anyone here says you and i included really matter
2212635 so this blog does not matter at all yet you continue to come here day after day and submit post after post after post score thats time well spent pal
2212636 i may be wasting my time but whats that say about a guy who remembers things i said months ago
2212637 oh by the way nice bike a little basket with a dog in it and some background music and it would be just like in that one movie
2212638 whats the matter with you have a house drop on ya or something
2212639 i still remember the days getting dropped of by my driver in the family rolls royce
2212640 nothing really i am just a shallow guy who likes to make fun of easy targets
2212641 and the chauffeur would undo your car seat before handing you your juice box ahhhh memories
2212642 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2212643 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2212644 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2212645 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2212646 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2212647 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2212648 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2212649 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2212650 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2212651 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2212652 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2212653 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2212654 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2212655 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2212656 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2212657 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2212658 it shall be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed
2212659 its a light hearted ad that pokes fun at him
2212660 you let people know what makes you tick and what your values and proposals are
2212661 ultimately they will make decisions that will reflect their economic interests and their sense of values
2212662 the antichrist isnt going to be an american so it cant possibly be obama the bible makes it clear he will be from an obscure place like romania
2212663 short of 666 they used every single symbol of the antichrist in this ad
2212664 there are way too many things to just be coincidence
2212665 the first rule of advertising is getting people to watch it
2212666 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2212667 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2212668 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2212669 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2212670 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2212671 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2212672 none of the treatments studied had any significant benefit over no treatment at all
2212673 its not in the realm that you would expect it to be if these interventions were really performing
2212674 its the army that brought an end to dictatorship in 2005
2212675 and today its once again she that brings an end to dictatorship to nepotism to chaos and disorder
2212676 in terms of milestones its important to point out that no casualty is more significant than any other
2212677 leadership seems to be looking at the afghan theater as the next big thing
2212678 i cant assure you that this train wreck isnt going to happen but i will do everything in my power to see that we avert it
2212679 should this happen dhl will cede significant elements of cost and quality to one of its chief competitors consumers all over america would suffer
2212680 reality shows interfere in your personal life to a great extent people love their privacy but these shows make life a public affair
2212681 these shows are good to watch as they offer some drama but as far working is concerned i am not comfortable doing them
2212682 its a story of a family that doesnt deal with drugs or contract killings
2212683 this is one of the most challenging roles of my career and i am looking forward to justify it with my performance
2212684 when i heard about the character i felt this is what i was looking for a challenging and refreshing role and i decided to act in the film
2212685 paying for obstetrics cover when youre retired makes as much sense as a young person paying for a hip replacement
2212686 the health care card takes care of prescriptions hospital and ambulance but not dental glasses and the like
2212687 we need to see more switching between products in this sector to drive competition
2212688 violent video games have been a problem for a long time
2212689 some parents dont know what their children are playing and are just happy they are not out of their sight but these games can have very damaging psychological effect on children especially games which depict violence so casually
2212690 furor over the killing compelled a local software distributor new era interactive media co ltd to announce it was halting sales and distribution of the game which is a worldwide best seller now in its fourth edition despite controversies over its depiction of violent street life
2212691 they were so excited theyre rvers so they can go anywhere on the road find a computer go into the phoenix public library catalogue download a book and play it while they drive down the highway
2212692 we also know we are touching only a small percentage of each librarys patrons
2212693 its a like this nice secret that we of course dont want to be kept secret
2212694 despite a softening global economy we delivered solid gains in worldwide sales pc shipments and profits
2212695 we will fully leverage this unique opportunity to showcase the lenovo brand on the world stage
2212696 this is the first time weve demonstrated a camera on a curved surface to really make it look like a human eye
2212697 if you simply bend it those materials are brittle like a ceramic bowl they break
2212698 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
2212699 currently when you take photos the middle part of the picture is very clear but when you go to the edge it is not so clear
2212700 it really extends to all of the electronics that we use on humans you want to have a curved surface to fit the human body that is really the place it can be used
2212701 if you want to develop an eye to replace a human eye certainly you want the shape to look like a human eye
2212702 jai tellement dhistoires juteuses r v ler et en plus jai lintention de tout raconter
2212703 our goal is to get 1 000 homes to go solor in three years
2212704 het zijn wilde dieren die makkelijk een paar vingers afhappen
2212705 de zwijnen weten inmiddels dat er voedsel te halen is en komen dus steeds terug dat nieuws gaat vervolgens als een lopend vuurtje over de campings in de omgeving steeds meer mensen komen kijken
2212706 afgehapte vingers of een zwijn onder een auto met wilde dieren weet je het nooit
2212707 this team of young conservative leaders will break records in the number and quality of independent conservative campus groups and publications they create starting this fall
2212708 with training and ideas from the leadership institute local campus groups fight against the leftist control on college campuses
2212709 whatever the proper resolution of the extraordinarily important questions presented the public interest clearly favors further consideration of issues before defendants are required to take actions that may forever alter the constitutional balance of separation of powers
2212710 the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
2212711 theres a catharsis everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good
2212712 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what we are looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country
2212713 if i have a chance to speak id be honored i want to do whatever it takes to get him over the goal line
2212714 i dont necessarily think there has to be a catholic strategy because im not sure the catholic vote is any more monolithic or predictable than any other vote
2212715 the most committed pro life voter and the most committed pro choice voter can come together over the issue of how do we help pregnant women
2212716 when a pro life voter considers that question which has a moral gravity to it which we dont talk about enough on balance barack has a better record

2212762 muy bien que l pez aguilar use el mes de agosto para hacer campa a interna frente a jer nimo saavedra de cara a su congreso regional
2212763 no le legitima para sacar a pasear su estilo falt n agresivo y ridiculizador del pueblo canario
2212764 que no siga faltando a la verdad cuando dice ser partidario de la gesti n transferida de los aeropuertos regionales a la comunidad aut noma
2212765 que salga que de la cara y diga si es o no partidario de que canarias pueda asumir la transferencia de una parte de la gesti n de sus aeropuertos
2212766 hacerle caso a saavedra y que elija entre irse a bruselas y quedarse en canarias
2212767 el problema no es la falta de dinero en canarias si no el tener prioridades equivocadas

2212772 we dont pay it any special attention so it is wonder that it has produced fruit this year it is perfect timing with the garden opening this weekend
2212773 london has a very special climate it is much warmer than the surrounding terrain it is unusual to grow bananas and it usually takes some doing people tend to over water their plants but it gives people immense pleasure when they do manage to grow the fruit
2212774 the mild winters we are having are allowing the banana plant to survive over winter and the warmer summers are improving the chances of it fruiting
2212775 astonished that the bbfc could have seen fit to allow anyone under the age of 15 to watch the film
2212776 unlike past batman films where the villains were somewhat surreal and comical figures heath ledgers joker is a brilliantly acted but very credible psychopathic killer who extols the use of knives to kill and disfigure his victims during a reign of urban terrorism laced with torture
2212777 it is a relentless violent film filled with dark themes and as i left i wondered what the board could possibly have been thinking
2212778 there is no way that a parent could have been guided by the classification and realised what they were about to see
2212779 we gave it a 12a rating because we think it is suitable for young teenagers
2212780 mr duncan smith can think what he wants hes entitled to his opinion
2212781 when you look at it 4 7 million people have seen the film and weve had around 100 complaints does that not say to you that this is not a serious issue
2212782 the point about film classifications is that watching a film is not an objective experience what one person might think of a film will be entirely different to someone elses view
2212783 its obviously a personal tragedy for him but on the other hand hes a grown man and i think for the good of the council he should stand down i would be very concerned if he didnt and very dissapointed
2212784 it was a brief conversation hes thinking about his future its a matter for him in terms of being a councillor its not something i can influence or should influence
2212785 he was the best brother father and son anybody could wish for
2212786 he was a loveable rogue whatever he did he didnt deserve to die
2212787 the most important thing in his life were cars and his family
2212788 ive lived in bushey all my life and there used to be so much for kids to do now theres nothing its a complete nightmare for parents as it puts so much strain on them
2212789 its great that the police have done this but its just for three hours and if its raining most people wont come why cant the council provide a permanent skate park there has to be some wasteland somewhere they could put it on everyone would go to it and there wouldnt be so much trouble with vandalism and graffiti
2212790 theres nowhere for us to go they need to dig a big skate park into the ground with bowls and volcanoes loads of people would come
2212791 its a shame some of the events are undersubscribed or not subscribed to at all i really dont know why it is perhaps they are not as well advertised and people dont know that they are going on
2212792 the council is now trying very hard to provide activities so hopefully the funds wont disappear if they decide the turnout hasnt been too great we need people to make a leap to get involved and try something new
2212793 the more we can do to keep young people occupied the better the trouble is you organise something fund it and then it goes out of fashion
2212794 what why not this is a good thing something to be happy about im proud of you
2212795 im not going to celebrate finally doing what i was supposed to be doing all along
2212796 there were five people on mattresses in the living room and three in each of the upstairs bedrooms they had clothes drying there and it was just filthy
2212797 we would not normally allow more than five people to share the facilities they had the conditions from a health point of view were unacceptable
2212798 there was no fire alarm and sockets were dangerously overloaded if there had been a fire they would not have got out in time
2212799 i suspect there are many more houses like this around harrow and london in general they were all young men in their 20s and none of them seemed to have papers which would suggest they had been bought here illegally
2212800 quite often with the chinese they are bought over here by organised crime gangs like the snakeheads with promises of huge earnings
2212801 some may wrongly believe that this is a victimless crime however it traps and controls women who are left with no choice other than to concede to their exploitation
2212802 the women we recovered from the trios brothels were often working 11 hours a day and made to service hundreds of men a week

2212804 het was echt fantastisch en te gek om binnen te komen met de hele ploeg achter je dit is toch wel een persoonlijk hoogtepunt voor mij
2212805 die warmte was eigenlijk ondraaglijk gelukkig viel het met de zwaarte van de vlag wel mee het was goed te doen hij zat ook in een soort steun op het einde begaf die het wel maar toen was ik er bijna
2212806 het was echt heel erg warm maar het was geweldig in dit stadion het is echt immens groot al die vrijwilligers waren ook dolenthousiast iedereen bleef in die hitte maar dansen en klappen
2212807 ik heb een paar dingen voorbij zien komen dat zag er indrukwekkend uit verder was het vooral lang wachten maar het was zeker de moeite waard
2212808 mij kennen ze niet sommigen willen wel pins met me ruilen maar ze weten niet wie ik ben
2212809 johan zei dat hij het niet had gedaan om mij te zieken hij wilde mij juist beschermen maar ik vond dat ik die bescherming niet nodig had ik heb de laatste tijd als tijdrijdster een grote stap gemaakt daar ben ik zelf ook verbaasd over

2212815 helaas weet ik dat het wel eens is voorgekomen dat een alleenstaande pleegouder door de kinderen of hun ouders werd beticht van ontucht dan sta je als man alleen niet sterk een valse beschuldiging kan iemand veel schade toebrengen
2212816 we bereiden hem voor op een teleurstelling ouders en de kinderen zelf hebben ook een stem en die kiezen vaak voor een zo gewoon mogelijke gezinssituatie of voor een alleenstaande vrouw het kan frustrerend zijn om een prachtplek voor een kind te hebben en toch in de kaartenbak te blijven
2212817 dit soort sectoren net als het onderwijs trekt ook mannen met slechte bedoelingen hoe goed ons onderzoek ook is naar iemands motieven een garantie kunnen wij natuurlijk nooit geven
2212818 het was een beetje uit paniek naar aanleiding van een zaak van misbruik overigens bij een gezin met een man en een vrouw
2212819 alleenstaande mannen hebben de schijn tegen maar echt bewijs dat er binnen deze groep eerder iets mis gaat ontbreekt we zijn er snel weer van teruggekomen

2212830 en in n klap waren de woorden van bush over de mensenrechten vergeten
2212831 niet over een economische grootmacht die een steeds grotere bedreiging voor de wereld wordt maar over een land met een oude cultuur fascinerende geluiden en traditionele beelden

2212833 nunca se sabe por donde viene el peligro por eso hay varios volando tenemos que controlarlo todo
2212834 we found there were a number of vehicles involved in accidents taking place in the same way at the same time of day and all the drivers were making claims even though the police and ambulance were not called
2212835 then we realised the people seemed to be connected to each other
2212836 the overriding principle was that the accidents never actually happened and it became clear that a lot of organisation went into this
2212837 its a relatively new type of crime to the uk first heard of in leeds and blackburn in 2000 but now its spread to the south where st albans watford and luton are certainly the hot spots
2212838 this is the first time a group like this has been prosecuted the judge had no case law to look at
2212839 it was a long and difficult process we had nothing to draw from and some of our techniques were untested
2212840 this is a really serious problem but its not really recognised as type of crime by most forces
2212841 we are trying to show forces how serious this is when you look at the amount of money involved which then goes on to be laundered you see how serious the implications are
2212842 its becoming more dangerous and that could result in serious injuries or even deaths
2212843 de dood van deze staatsman herinnert ons eraan dat amerika beroemd is om zijn nostalgie het verlangen naar zijn eigen ouderwetse notie van denken aan de toekomst
2212844 this was how we taught someone a lesson in vietnam
2212845 i would say he was doing between 75 and 80 mph
2212846 father and i had been chatting the vehicle swerved and i looked up as we left the road after the crash i noticed some smoke and opened the door so father could get out i dialled 999
2212847 there was some cocaine in his system can you help me
2212848 he was fine he did not appear to be suffering from the effects of any drug
2212849 the vehicle was starting to overtake then the bonnet was across the front of me i hit the brakes and my car started to spin
2212850 i heard hysterical voices i remember a small boy next to me shaking and upset an older lad was saying weve got to get my dad out
2212851 when a child goes off the rails as young as 13 or 14 like cara did there is very little hope of getting her back on track although she might be perceived as a troublemaker she was really just a misunderstood kid who didnt really have much of a chance in life
2212852 it was my birthday on august 4 but i couldnt celebrate it but being here is the best birthday present ever
2212853 its been fantastic we were here in february for the world cup so we know the pool but this is the first time we have been to the olympic village
2212854 everything has been perfect and all the athletes are really well looked after its been an amazing experience already i am really looking forward to competing now
2212855 we have been quite lucky with the weather with only a bit of rain but i got caught in one downpour
2212856 the smog is probably the worst thing normally you can see how big the city is but when the smog comes in it is hard to see in front of you
2212857 sometimes you get short of breath if you step outside after a hard training session and it is very humid too
2212858 were so well prepared for anything that is thrown at us that we are ready for anything
2212859 im like a caged animal locked up and i want to get out and compete
2212860 for years and years the preparation has been to get to the olympic games there has been so much disappointment with injuries and the like it is amazing to be here
2212861 some people get quite wrapped up in the food hall meeting people and eating more than you should to kill time and boredom
2212862 im not rooming with him but hes a 14 year old boy in the olympic village in beijing he is over the moon to be here
2212863 normally when i have fun i perform well the whole team was sat down and we were told it is about putting in a performance so when we leave we can hold our heads high
2212864 our personal best is 446 so if we can beat that then ill be happy and then who knows
2212865 i am on facebook and have had so many messages from across the world and so much support
2212866 my mum is coming out to watch me and some of my mates too
2212867 some people think if it is your first olympics you will not do well but i do not believe that
2212868 the canadian economy is clearly downshifting in response to the downturn in the u s and the past run up in the canadian dollar
2212869 anyone reading the newspapers has been well aware of the flurry of plant closings and downsizing announcements and statistics canada surveys are finally catching up to that reality
2212870 canadians havent experienced job losses like this since 17 years ago when the country was in full recession
2212871 since this time last year weve lost another 88 000 manufacturing jobs now in the middle of the summer were seeing people give up on the job market altogether

2212890 most children who die in this country still die in pain
2212891 while adults at the end of life expect state of the art pain and symptom management thats not yet the case in pediatrics children metabolize drugs differently than adults and most children dont have access to specialists trained to provide the appropriate care
2212892 if i ever finish medical training i told myself i want to find a better way
2212893 i thought minnea what it took me five minutes to find it on the map
2212894 too many of the families who come to us have heard im so sorry but theres nothing more we can do for the pain
2212895 here we never give up and theres always a lot we can do

2212910 in other cities protesters are not just handcuffing themselves to each other
2212911 they put their handcuffs inside pvc tubes which are inside concrete theyve figured out ways that keep the police from just using bolt cutters to cut them apart they also use buckets of urine and feces and various noxious substances to pour on themselves or the police
2212912 angry drivers can be even more dangerous than police under these circumstances

2212941 a alemanha a terceira melhor equipe do mundo e pelo que observamos o seu jogo de ataque se baseia na armadora direita e na central vamos tentar controlar bem as principais jogadas das advers rias mas primeiro temos que manter a nossa identidade o nosso estilo de jogo que uma defesa agressiva com forte contra ataques e muita vontade de atacar

2212953 gran parte de las universidades latinoamericanas son estatales y los gobiernos no les exigen mucho en materia de control de calidad y cuando intentan exigirles calidad las universidades se resisten escud ndose en el principio de la autonom a universitaria
2212954 la unam es una instituci n cerrada a la evaluaci n externa
2212955 pr cticamente todas las universidades p blicas del pa s se han sometido a la evaluaci n externa menos la unam
2212956 cuando empezamos a acreditar a las universidades la uba decidi no acreditar apel en los tribunales el argumento es que tiene un nivel tal que no hay qui n la acredite y que atenta contra la autonom a universitaria que un organismo externo a la universidad la acredite hicieron un juicio contra el ministerio de educaci n

2212961 la educaci n universitaria en am rica latina sigue siendo altamente elitista y la mayor parte de los estudiantes provienen de los segmentos m s adinerados de la sociedad
2212962 al principio se cobraba el equivalente a 25 d lares por a o por alumno pero la cifra ha crecido a entre 500 y 600 d lares anuales es mucho dinero para los estudiantes pero las matr culas constituyen una parte considerable de los ingresos de las universidades
2212963 china es un pa s con enormes necesidades educativas que el gobierno no puede satisfacer no podemos ofrecer educaci n gratuita creo que el sistema actual es bueno promueve el desarrollo de la educaci n y es un est mulo para que los estudiantes se tomen su estudio m s en serio y estudien m s fuerte
2212964 s lo los estudiantes m s pobres la mayor a de ellos en zonas rurales no pagan por sus estudios y en muchos casos reciben subsidios adicionales para poder estudiar sin necesidad de trabajar al mismo tiempo
2212965 algunos cr ticos aseguran que estos incidentes representan la punta del iceberg
2212966 en la pr ctica tenes seis ex menes de ingreso o ninguno seg n c mo lo quieras mirar
2212967 la globalizaci n est creando una clase media muy grande en india y china y de personas que valoran mucho la educaci n la gente all est dispuesta a hacer un gran esfuerzo financiero para invertir en la educaci n de sus hijos
2212968 en la argentina hasta el a o 2003 se graduaban s lo 3 ingenieros textiles por a o
2212969 en vez de invertir tanto en formar m s abogados los gobiernos latinoamericanos deber an invertir en la creaci n de escuelas intermedias e institutos t cnicos
2212970 las econom as latinoamericanas van hacia industrias con mayores requerimientos tecnol gicos para producir exportaciones de mayor valor agregado necesitan mas t cnicos y menos licenciados en ciencia pol tica
2212971 mire andr s lo primero que me gustar a puntualizar es que la unam realiza el 5o por ciento de toda la investigaci n que se hace en m xico la unam ha venido desde hace much simos a os impulsando el desarrollo de la investigaci n cient fica que en m xico se hace fundamentalmente en universidades p blicas
2212972 creo que el problema radica fundamentalmente en que no ha habido en m xico una pol tica de estado con una visi n de mediano y de largo plazo que nos hubiese permitido como ocurri en algunos de los pa ses de la cuenca del pac fico tener un desarrollo que hubiera resultado mucho m s fruct fero
2212973 ano es responsabilidad de la universidad complementar los ingresos que recibe del estado con otras fuentes de financiamiento porque f jese por ejemplo el n mero de cient ficos e ingenieros por mill n de habitantes en varios pa ses finlandia tiene 5 mil cient ficos e ingenieros por mill n de habitantes la argentina 713 chile 370 y m xico solamente 225 o sea menos que nadie
2212974 est faltando en m xico una pol tica de estado para que puedan concurrir universidades sector privado y el propio estado que no debe eludir responsabilidad porque una sola instituci n insisto por m s que tenga un compromiso como lo ha tenido la unam con la ciencia es imposible que pueda ser el detonante de todo el desarrollo se necesita andr s una visi n de mediano y de largo plazo porque la inversi n en ciencia no es una inversi n rentable de inmediato estamos metidos todo el tiempo en la coyuntura
2212975 al final de la huelga uno de los acuerdos fue que la unam rompi relaciones con el instituto acreditador ceneval bajo el argumento de que es un organismo neoliberal vinculado a empresas privadas
2212976 la unam figura muy alto en investigaci n pero eso no se refleja en sus programas cos
2212977 desde el conflicto de 1999 la unam mucho su calidad y su imagen
2212978 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2212979 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
2212980 igual vos en el ybr con que pongas la primera despues podes pasar los cambios sin embragar
2212981 mesmo assim vejo boas possibilidades de nos classificarmos nessa chave
2212982 estamos em negocia o com a traffic para negociar o wilians e o marquinhos mas por enquanto nada est fechado
2212983 ainda n o discutimos se vamos ceder 100 dos jogadores ou uma parte deles
2212984 fizemos uma proposta para o vit ria a respeito dos dois mas a id ia eles ficarem no vit ria neste ano no ano que vem deixa a din mica do futebol acontecer
2212985 mas ainda estamos esperando uma comunica o oficial do vit ria estamos negociando mas eles ainda n o responderam nossa proposta
2212986 if sexual partners were reduced by 50 and if circumcision was adopted then we would be closer to keeping the epidemic under control
2212987 for every 5 people infected three die without ever getting treatment during their lifetime
2212988 massive change is required if we are to reach this turning point in the next few years
2212989 follow up data at 6 to 9 months showed that change in housing status was associated with change in hiv aids related risk behaviours including needle sharing and unprotected sex in comparison with individuals whose housing status did not change
2212990 were assessed via pre intervention and post intervention cross sectional surveys testing for sexually transmitted infections participant observations and serial cross sectional screenings for infection results reveal significant increase in condom use with new clients up from 75 to 94 significant increase in condom use with regular partners 13 to 29 significant reductions in prevalence of stis 29 to 16 and significant increases in sex workers verbal rejections of unsafe sex 50 to 70
2212991 there are also country examples of successful structural approaches uganda reported falling hiv prevalence throughout the 1990s the most common explanation was how through a range of actions the country created an open enabling environment for confronting the epidemic although definitely attributing causality to any one programme or strategy is difficult the example of uganda illustrates that national level social mobilisation and policy efforts to involve local agencies and enable tailored structural approaches to hiv prevention are possible
2212992 9 out of 10 people interviewed in nicaragua were familiar with at least one of the mass communication components
2212993 the attitude of 22 of those respondents who do not agree with the statement that women who carry condoms in their bags are easy
2212994 the attitude of 19 of those who would eat at the same table as a person with hiv
2212995 an increase in knowledge and use of hiv related services
2212996 35 of those respondents who in the last 6 months have been to a center to address issues related to sexuality
2212997 a significant increase in interpersonal communication about hiv prevention and sexual behaviour and community based dialogue on key topics
2212998 21 of those respondents who had talked to someone about one of these hiv related issues over the past 6 months
2212999 23 of those respondents who said that they had talked to their partners about using a condom in the past 6 months
2213000 18 of those respondents who reported using a condom during their last sexual relationships with a casual partner in the past 6 months
2213001 the silence our caps that masks the particularly high risk of hiv risk confronting men who have sex with men in africa and other highly impacted regions also exacerbates aids in black america
2213002 as in many other parts of the world many black women in the us are rendered vulnerable to hiv as a result of gender inequality our caps underscoring a programmatic and research priority both in black america and throughout the world
2213003 where national aids responses have succeeded communities have mobilised to fight stigma overcome prejudice and promote solidarity in the fight against the epidemic while leading black organisations publications and constituencies are placing increasing priority on the fight against aids they are typically doing so without the support of the us government lacking sufficient resources the efforts of these groups have yet to achieve maximum impact enhanced support for community mobilisation in black america is urgently needed
2213004 by former linux kernel developer con kolivas talks about how even with complete control over the software the pc platform architecture has become so convoluted over the decades that machines that are technically 1 000 times faster theyre 10 times slower in
2213005 im for free trade as long as its fair trade
2213006 trade has winners and losers and there have been a lot of losers in ohio
2213007 it has never since touched a level that high again why the hell doesnt anyone say that in public its so obvious a thing to look at
2213008 are in the early phase of ict adoption characterised by patchy uncoordinated provision and use some enhancement of the learning process some development of e learning but no profound improvements in learning and teaching
2213009 once the foundations are laid the benefits will be considerable
2213010 make the case that information and communication processes and the media of communication are a fundamental part of how governance systems operate in any political community what is more they are fundamental to the agenda of pro poor social and political change
2213011 p articipants agreed that deepening voice and accountability in developing countries is about people including those living in economic poverty making the decisions that affect their lives
2213012 how can progressive or sustained campaigns be built in an environment of media moments celebrity dependence and tabloid petitions who writes the script of the campaign choosing and framing actions and deciding what counts as success how can you counter the risks associated with corporate co option and collaboration with government how can you target decision makers most effectively in the era of network governance and where campaigns can take place at the level of the local national and global
2213013 the cris campaigns struggle to shape global norms by mobilizing civil society actors reflects a long term attempt to formulate and apply an overarching ideology to guide policy advocacy an ideology that originated with communication scholars and which attempted to put exalted concepts of the social role of communication at the center of policy development
2213014 the particular inquiry of this collection is on the political influences on media specifically news media and medias role in shaping political outcomes
2213015 formal government driven processes served to undermine potential activism around opposition people need means to question the official line on water scarcity and to meaningfully process or question information global environmental debates have influence on policies and processes but government commitment to international protocols and guidelines needs to be followed through and demonstrated in local policies and practice there is a tension between the science of managing scarce natural resources and the language of peoples rights and empowerment so called democratic spaces created by government can weaken the impetus of voluntary forms of social mobilisation and resistance
2213016 t he only technology that compares to the mobile phone in terms of pervasiveness and accessibility in the developing world is the radio indeed considered together radios and mobile phones can serve as a broad distribution participatory media network with some of the same citizen media dynamics of the internet but accessible to a much wider and non literate audience
2213017 sms messages about political corruption helped turn the tide against joseph estrada and led to sms organized street protests and estradas eventual ouster filipino activists have organized subsequent text based protests many focused on lobbying for mobile phone users rights sms messages in ukraine helped mobilize tens of thousands of young demonstrators in the streets of kiev in late 2004 to protest election fraud and demand a revote in both cases calls to take to the streets spread organically virally with recipients forwarding the messages to multiple friends
2213018 centre lokol is the only organisation in drc that is advocating conflict transformation to a mass audience it combines practical peace building with the power of the mass media i e radio to inform and encourage congolese participation in the ongoing peace process as well as influencing knowledge attitudes and behaviour of the audience in ways that can facilitate peace the key achievement of cls radio output is that it produces informative relevant and stimulating material which is disseminated to mass audiences in parts of the country where few other sources of information or discussion reach programmes have contributed to transition processes by enabling people to become better informed about the transition and better able to assess and act on information and by providing outlets for popular opinions and commentary
2213019 one of the few independent media outlets in the eastern democratic republic of the congo
2213020 there is not a single sign of an unmanageable flood of traffic if anything a slowdown is visible more than a speedup this suggests that the industry might benefit from shifting its emphasis towards methods of stimulating traffic growth
2213021 wouldnt that encourage them to take lots of time to do their work
2213022 h uma gasto desordenado em olinda no ano passado foram investidos r 57 milh es na sa de e para 2008 a previs o de r 55 milh es mas ningu m v a melhoria do atendimento popula o

2213027 increased active and effective participation of women in local government decision making
2213028 there was a substantial increase in womens participation in the awareness melas ensuring womens participation was not an easy task timing for womens groups visits venue and even in some cases activities in the design of the mela had to be strategically changed to ensure better participation of women because of this flexibility throughout the campaign women remained active participants either individually as councilors or in organized groups like teachers and lady health visitors despite resistance from men women actively participated in all activities and shared their views and concerns about local governance especially issues faced by women
2213029 were registered in the target union councils as a result of the current awareness campaigns
2213030 in addition women used to visit union council offices for specific purposes e g birth and death certificates zakat funds for poor etc now the interests are various including complaints about different services like education and health water supply and sanitation and of course ccb funds
2213031 in kotli rai abu bakar village people especially women were facing the problem of drinking water during awareness melas they raised this issue in response to this the uc naib nazim worked with the tehsil naib nazim and revitalized a turbine that was out of order now many households are supplied with drinking water
2213032 a crucial document for women to exercise their economic political and civil rights
2213033 in the rural conservative community of uc faridabad in district lodhran women are not used to wearing shoes it is believed that women should not wear shoes or any kind of footwear as they do not have equal status to men during the cdsp awareness campaign this issue was raised by some groups as a result youth of the area is now working on breaking this habit and tradition
2213034 adults often neglect to discuss armed political conflict with children they may think children are impervious to the constructs of conflict or in need of sheltering from it and so fear raising the subject
2213035 policymakers and media practitioners hoping to ameliorate conflict by attempting to alter childrens attitudes and behaviors through the use of peace communication should treat children as actual members of the public and so too include their input in their decision making processes because there is evidence that children can provide coherent and meaningful answers and can be in any case aware of and even involved in armed political conflict i recommend adults find out how children feel and think when exposed to childrens peace communication programming especially when the point is to change their attitudes and behaviors not those of adults
2213036 when you go out to bat youve just got to bat you cant be a captain when you are batting
2213037 i just batted like i normally do i like to keep it simple do the simplest things as well as i can i went out to enjoy myself

2213040 hed never hurt a person it would be completely against his character
2213041 hes basically a 22 year old whos a teenager he says things that are inappropriate
2213042 in my heart i know he didnt mean it he would be more likely to save a life than do to the other
2213043 hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2213044 he always wanted to be a police officer to help people he wanted to help people who were victims of abuse
2213045 should not be seen as a precedent or indicator to any future decision in a similar situation
2213046 the victim of the robbery has been advised of this decision police would like to reinforce advice given to all retailers that active resistance in this situation is not encouraged
2213047 in the end i thought of the lift it was going to give me
2213048 we had a little ceremony presenting the cloak to him again as we left the indoor stadium and the team did a haka to acknowledge and honour him
2213049 looking at his face and seeing the joy on it was wonderful
2213050 these congressional approval ratings are worse than we had on the eve of losing the majority
2213051 dont be afraid to say you are disappointed in fellow republicans dont hesitate to be anti washington d c
2213052 discouraged candidates from attending the national convention in minneapolis st paul saying that spending days there would be a waste of time and they would be better off campaigning
2213053 there are too many personal and campaign related events going on at that time including the all american futurity horse race meeting with constituents and spending time with my family
2213054 were going to run our race the way weve been running it i am a republican but more importantly a conservative who listens to people to understand the issues facing this district and find solutions
2213055 my real life experiences fit the diversity of our district and are more important than party labels
2213056 demonstrate an apparent acceptance by the legislature that home schooling is taking place in california with home schools allowed as private schools
2213057 recent statutes indicate that the legislature is aware that some parents in california home school their children by declaring their homes to be private schools
2213058 i will try to serve you with dignity and honesty just like we ran this campaign
2213059 i knew the time was right and i felt i was the right person to do it
2213060 ive been to d c several times with my sister for school davis kind of gave us a cold shoulder
2213061 i think your representative should take the time of day to come out and shake your hand i like roes people not politics platform
2213062 im here to report that tennessee and tennessee district 9 voted firmly for the post racial politics that has carried a new generation to power
2213063 merely states the facts i think the nation needs to know steve cohens complete record

2213066 we are radiohead thank you for coming to see us play
2213067 i wrote the book in response to people asking me what it was like to go from housewife to house speaker and for advice as to how young people especially women could balance family and career
2213068 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2213069 i believe in renewable fuels i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2213070 my mission and my job as president of the united states will be to make sure every market in the world is open to your products
2213071 agriculture products here in the state of iowa can feed the world and were not afraid to compete with anybody
2213072 this is the heartland of america this is what america is all about this is the people i want to know and meet
2213073 he voted against ethanol subsidies hes opposed to the farm bill
2213074 what it proves is he doesnt care about whats important to iowa
2213075 america is hurting right now weve got a lot of work to do
2213076 just as i have opposed additional consolidation in air passenger service i have serious concerns about the ups dhl alliance my concerns include the transactions effects on service costs consumer choice and jobs
2213077 this alliance is likely to eliminate two cargo air carriers abx and astar which now serve dhl and compete with ups this would lessen or even eliminate competition between ups and dhl in providing overnight package delivery services
2213078 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2213079 its not that youre not ready barak obama is not ready yet because when it comes to the economy experience matters and he just doesnt have it he says hell give you change but thats what hell leave you with
2213080 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2213081 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2213082 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2213083 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2213084 whatever decision is made its going to be a collaborative decision
2213085 i think all this sort of speculation is much ado about very little
2213086 were just working out the details however those details play out that doesnt change the bottom line the fact that everyones on the same team here
2213087 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2213088 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2213089 grabed his leg wow your an obsessed asshole get a life and suck some cock
2213090 whats most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2213091 i wholeheartedly condemn the violation of georgias sovereignty i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this arms conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks
2213092 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2213093 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2213094 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2213095 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2213096 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2213097 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2213098 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2213099 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal
2213100 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against martin luther king with the 50 states
2213101 see richard doesnt really mean what he says its popular for him to say it thats the way he makes a living
2213102 same as jesse jackson some more of our black revolutionaries who make a living off of keeping things emotional
2213103 i dont think the majority of white people are thinking that way anymore
2213104 im concerned that once he gets in office that he wont be recognized as an american president

2213111 i wouldent date a girl if they didnt accept my brothers
2213112 she said there was females outside the apartment with guns and they was trying to get the neighbors to get her to come outside
2213113 they said that the story was unbelievable and asked them to leave the building
2213114 knowing her she probably got a little bit belligerent with them from being impatient and thats probably when they put her out of the building
2213115 i look at that as the fault of the city of louisville i think that if anybody for whatever reason has the nerve to go down and try to take out an epo for any reason theres a reason
2213116 the memories is what are going to get a hold of me
2213117 oh wow what do you say to a young adult

2213125 i look forward to continuing to represent the best interests of the states wheat producers
2213126 the kansas wheat commission continues to move forward building on its strong history
2213127 kawg has a great history of serving the wheat grower from its inception through this current year
2213128 there have been many challenges as well as opportunities while engaging state and national legislators on issues that matter to kansas wheat producers
2213129 i am excited about the future for the kansas wheat industry as we assist all stakeholders through effective policy work and providing the framework for advancements in wheat research that is beneficial for the kansas wheat producer
2213130 this is a great educational opportunity about how to be responsible
2213131 do you see the dead corpse of that imperial city what can be glorious in life if such wealth and beauty has come to nothing but who has stood firm in these wretched changes what survives the relics of the saints and the chair of the fisherman

2213135 if you think that im here in minnesota that im going to throw my white sox under the bus its not going to happen
2213136 in terms of magnitudes of scale the less power we use the more efficient we are that will probably have a bigger impact on the environment than anything else
2213137 weve seen a lot of h1b people come in from india thats a concern of mine since some of my friends have been laid off
2213138 now companies will argue that were getting these folks because theyre the only ones who can do the job
2213139 i dont believe that i see qualified people ushered out the door
2213140 im happy for obama breaking the racial thing if hes elected hes my president
2213141 ill support him and pray for him but ill have a hole in my heart that this country is morally going off of the deep end
2213142 he started out like a regular guy like us a single mother stuff like that
2213143 we noticed he had cracks in his shoes we liked that its important to have regular shoes
2213144 they were normal shoes i thought theyd be all fancy he seemed down to earth it was something

2213151 he feels that its really important that we make it a priority that we stop just talking about doing something about the energy problem and the price of oil and actually do something about it and pointing out that oil profits are at a record high and we are paying until very recently four dollars a gallon
2213152 in my middle 50s i get polled because i have a telephone and im a registered voter and they can call me but the younger voters that are coming into this and barack has energized so many of them are not getting touched so i dont trust the polls particularly

2213162 were hoping to raise over 2 000 the individuals involved have been getting really good support from family and friends
2213163 we just want service users to be able to move on and set new challenges in their lives its about employability and building confidence we want them to be proud of what they have achieved this event is a great opportunity for them to meet other like minded people by the end of the week theres a great sense of achievement
2213164 i was absolutely thrilled when i heard apex scotland had selected the oncology department its a phenomenal challenge its inspiring all the money raised will be put to very good use
2213165 we have a cancer general fund which we can use for appropriate things to improve the patients lives
2213166 thats not the basic things you would expect from the nhs but things like scalp cooling machines so that people dont lose their hair theyre not essential but they help what we do
2213167 at light levels equivalent to a moonless night in dense woodland
2213168 he was considered a hero by the chinese people have asked me whether he would have been a communist or a nationalist if he had lived possibly a nationalist but i think he would above all have been there for the chinese people
2213169 im really pleased that the translation is not into mandarin but the simple chinese that ordinary people can read and because it has been published in china it can be sold in the country without any restrictions though it had to go through the censor
2213170 we will be going to taijin where eric was born and to his grave at the prison camp at weifang
2213171 ive never been to china before so im really looking forward to getting the chance to see both of those places
2213172 my dad did some part time journalism and i tagged along with him to rugby and athletics meetings i remember going up to an athletics club room where there was a big picture of him and was told that some of his records still stood
2213173 i knew about him already because in scotland we dont have so many field and track olympic medallists
2213174 and one of the things i was interested in was why he hadnt wanted to run on a sunday
2213175 its a very detailed look at his sporting achievements and i think that distinguishes it from some of the others that have been written
2213176 i would prefer to see it in the sporting section in bookshops
2213177 i felt that of all the biographers i had some unique qualifications i was a scot i was an athlete and a rugby player i am a historian of athletics and i am also a christian and i think all these things together give an aspect to it thats a wee bit different
2213178 i hope it will run to 2012 and that itll be an inspiration to young scots and others particularly those interested in athletics
2213179 mi sono sentito bene ho giocato senza dolore sto migliorando giorno dopo giorno da oltre una settimana che lavoravo per questo rientro chiaro ora mi manca un po il ritmo partita ma andato tutto bene come speravamo
2213180 mourinho nei giorni scorsi mi ha chiesto come mi sentivo lui in allenamento mi vedeva bene e anchio gli ho detto si sono pronto posso tornare a giocare per me era importante scendere in campo era importate per capire come stava andando il lavoro e il risultato stato positivo
2213181 valuteremo nelle prossime ore come risponder il ginocchio ma io credo che risponder bene e quindi spero di giocare domani e anche a lisbona contro il benfica lultima amichevole
2213182 id certainly be a good advert for wimpey the house builders because this has given me a new lease of life
2213183 basically they told me they would pour liquid cement into the cracks in the vertebrae of my spine i dont know what type of cement it was but the doctor told me when it set it would be as hard as concrete
2213184 they couldnt use pins because i suffer from osteoporosis and my bones are too brittle they wouldnt hold the pins so they came up with this idea instead and it certainly did the trick
2213185 i went through the operation last september and was conscious throughout the procedure
2213186 my family and friends really thought i would be a goner because i just love the outdoors and playing the pipes if i wasnt able to that it could have been the death of me
2213187 i was working on strathconon estate and was about 26 at the time i went into a peat hag with the pony to collect the stag i was on my own because the other keepers had moved on so i had to get the stag onto the ponys back myself
2213188 it kept sliding from side to side on the peat and i twisted my spine trying to hold on to it
2213189 without the operation i know i would not have been able to walk the pain began to ease as time went on and i am just delighted to be back playing again
2213190 i am glad to hear he has the puff to play the pipes as the rib cage is supported by the spine
2213191 inverness was the second place in scotland to introduce the procedure of vertebroplasty after gartnavel in glasgow in 2003
2213192 ross murray of headland archaeology was monitoring site clearance when he recognised the cover slab of an undisturbed stone cist
2213193 careful hand excavation revealed that it contained a single skeleton
2213194 the style of burial indicated that the cist dated to the early bronze age around 2000bc
2213195 the site has now been cleared of archaeological remains and development of housing there can proceed as planned without any delay
2213196 oh i was able to get myself thru college without having a job so i could focus on my studies
2213197 you appear to be at ease with the use of violence
2213198 i didnt read the predicitions this time but i did hear about them comments like that can only spur us on
2213199 we have proved ourselves in this league in three of the years we have only just missed out on the top six last year we missed out by just six points and that was despite losing our first six games of the season we must be doing something right to still be so close
2213200 people can have their say but well just get on with our game and ensure that we do our best we are an established side but we know we have to keep improving because it does get harder each year
2213201 it was really good to play against a championship team the first half they were sharp and scored a couple of goals
2213202 in the second half we pressed them more and got back in the game with andy scoring we could have even got a draw because we created a few chances at the end the match will have done us a lot of good for the season ahead
2213203 having played burnley the danish teams st johnstone and ross county in pre season the standard has been good preparation for the year ahead
2213204 we need to defend better as a team starting from the strikers going forward we havent been too bad although we could maybe break with a bit more pace but hopefully come saturday things will click into gear and well turn aberdeen over
2213205 we have a younger squad this year and it will be good for them to get their chance as im sure they will personally jamie duff and iain vigurs have done exceptionally well in pre season they have been the stand outs its up to those boys to push hard for a place in the team and the other younger boys to keep progressing
2213206 the target every year for us has to be to stay in the league if you start aiming too high then you can fail well go for as high as we can and wherever we finish above 11th then its an absolute bonus

2213216 nosotros lo que hemos hecho con sto es desarrollar la constituci n todas las leyes est n apegadas estrictamente a la carta magna ahora hay personas que lo consideran como un contrabando de la reforma constitucional y son los mismos argumentos que siempre han pronunciado as como lo hicieron con el tema de la propiedad privada que le iban a quitar la panader a a la gente que le iban a quitar a los ni os es el mismo argumento de siempre cuando se trata de medidas que van a beneficiar al com n de los venezolanos
2213217 nosotros si somos defensores de la constituci n y no hacemos nada que se salga de lo estipulado por ella
2213218 se aprob el primero de febrero del a o pasado el presidente fue habilitado en una serie de materias y dentro de las facultades que le confiri la asamblea nacional estuvo tambi n la de preparar o promulgar leyes con car cter org nico cumpliendo con el requisitos de enviarlas a la sala constitucional del tribunal supremo de justicia cosa que se cumpli
2213219 evidentemente no han le do la ley puesto que los componentes de la fuerza armada en la nueva ley siguen siendo el ej rcito la armada la aviaci n y la guardia nacional y a la reserva se le cambia la denominaci n a milicia nacional bolivariana aparece como un elemento de complemento a los componentes de la fuerza armada as est establecido en la ley
2213220 por ejemplo est la ley de migraci n de las actividades en la faja petrol fera del orinoco que implic la recuperaci n y la nacionalizaci n real de las operaciones en la faja pero hay otra ley que no se menciona en ning n momento que es la famosa ley de amnist a que sali a mediados del a o pasado y que gracias a ella muchos de los que salen hoy atacando la habilitante pueden hacerlo libremente sin ning n riesgo porque estaban acusados de violar la constituci n y del golpe del 11 12 y 13 de abril de 2002
2213221 no existe ning n art culo de la constituci n que lo prohiba porque el pa s se denomina rep blica bolivariana de venezuela la constituci n igual es decir que el calificativo de bolivariano para la rep blica puede ser utilizado por cualquiera de los entes nada lo prohibe
2213222 eso es mentira nadie est nombrando poderes locales ni regionales lo que establece la constituci n las competencias y facultades que tienen los gobernadores y alcaldes en ning n momento est n disminuidas se est n refiriendo fundamentalmente a una ley que debe ir a un proceso de discusi n m s amplio que tiene que ver con el reordenamiento del territorio sin embargo hemos tenido en el pa s autoridades de desarrollo regional que han sido nombradas previstas en la constituci n del a o 1961 por eso vemos corpozulia corpooriente corpollano corpoandes que existieron en determinado momento
2213223 est en un proceso de inscribir nuestros candidatos a las alcald as y gobernaciones porque el proceso para nombrarlos es por medio del sufragio
2213224 la propiedad privada se utiliza como argumento para tratar de justificar la especulaci n el acaparamiento y el boicot la persona que realiza actividades donde se prestan servicios a la gente como alimentos medicinas sabe en todas partes del mundo que tiene que cumplir las reglas porque est obligado a prestar ese servicio el estado tiene que buscar la manera de que eso se cumpla de que no sea utilizado como un elemento de poder o manipulaci n de los que tienen esa concesi n y tienen el permiso eso no tiene que ver con la propiedad privada tiene que ver con las actividades que inciden en el funcionamiento del estado y est n orientadas a satisfacer las necesidades de la gente

2213275 despite differences in language culture and economic status people around the world are united in their fundamental need to connect discover and interact
2213276 poor countries were perfectly justified to fight for their right to defend vulnerable farmers from subsidized agricultural import surges
2213277 this is a major disappointment at a time when food and fuel prices are high and the global economic outlook is uncertain the worlds poorest people are increasingly vulnerable a decent trade deal could have given them a chance to prevent worsening poverty
2213278 rich countries should have shown the political leadership to deliver trade reform that reduced poverty instead they defended vested interests and put poor countries under intense pressure to make concessions that have no place in a development round
2213279 this is another missed opportunity for trade reform that poor countries badly need and have been long promised it was brought about by rich countries failure to keep their word
2213280 it would be outrageous to blame poor countries for the failure to get a deal if the eu and us had made meaningful offers that lived up to their promises we might have seen progress instead they demanded harsh concessions from developing countries in exchange for largely illusory reforms and limited flexibilities

2213289 i mean is this going to be something we cant even interpret through polling we can talk about the bradley effect because of what happened to tom bradley when he ran for governor of california and won in the polls twice and lost the governorship twice on election day ive seen theories about this that unless the african american candidate is able to get the election number he needs he wont get it that day he has to get it in the polling and barack hasnt cracked about 45 percent
2213290 pollsters look for the bradley effect the idea that some white voters are reluctant to say they support a white candidate over a black candidate the phrase refers to californias 1982 gubernatorial election when the late tom bradley a black democratic mayor of los angeles led in exit polls against white republican george deukmejian mr bradley lost the election the conclusion some voters hid their true choice from pollsters
2213291 they call it an investment vehicle because its designed to drive off with your money
2213292 the fact that we have three national championships in two years is probably a major contributing factor
2213293 we know our students like to have a good time
2213294 youre fighting every day for your life the last thing you want to be stressed about is that you dont have a job when you get back
2213295 as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics the coordination
2213296 tightening credit in three consecutive quarters have not helped in lowering inflation
2213297 if this kind of strict monetary policy is followed further we are apprehensive
2213298 we consider that there is some materialisation of the risks that we have identified
2213299 most of the fall in euro dollar came from the extremely dovish comments from trichet in combination with gloomy data from the euro zone but growth is definitely a problem everywhere
2213300 it is not very surprising given the structural weakness of the italian economy
2213301 it should not have come as surprise to anyone that on balance the bank felt it could do nothing but sit tight this month a situation that is likely to prevail for a few more months
2213302 the mpc continues to be pulled in opposing directions by rising inflation and slowing growth
2213303 however the balance of risk appears to be shifting more rapidly a cut in interest rates may be needed sooner rather than later to prevent the economy from drifting towards recession
2213304 the mpc cannot ignore the fact that recession threats have worsened
2213305 while the near term rise in inflation is unavoidable it is also temporary as weaker growth would clearly push down inflation sharply next year limiting the threat of a major recession must be the priority
2213306 pressure on householders income together with a very significant reduction in mortgage finance due to the global financial markets crisis is constraining potential house buyers ability to enter the market
2213307 this is resulting in both lower prices and activity levels
2213308 with transaction activity at a new low and likely to fall further in the wake of the uncertainty surrounding hm treasurys comments on stamp duty it is hard to see any near term relief on prices
2213309 the stimulus tax cheques really had a marginal effect at best and it has run its course and theres no carry through
2213310 its difficult to see where some sort of boost in spending is going to come from
2213311 how a wine can partner with that dish and not only make the dish better but make the wine better too
2213312 it was sort of a eureka moment and its my only one so far
2213313 these types of solutions are bulky and they are hard to transport out of the lab
2213314 you take away some of the impreciseness of the human hand i am able to use my hands to control the instruments but im able to do them more delicately
2213315 i freaked out a bit got on the internet and called around to find out what was out there for me
2213316 i worry about that a little bit you have such sophisticated technology and doing such complicated surgery what kind of experience does your doctor have
2213317 in the face of impossible odds people who love their country can change it
2213318 as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics of the four days our staffs are in communication my staff with senator clintons staff but i dont anticipate any problems
2213319 the first woman in american history to win presidential primaries in our nation
2213320 proud that we have put 18 million cracks in the highest glass ceiling
2213321 to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
2213322 its as old as greek drama theres a catharsis everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good
2213323 we do not want any democrat in the hall or in the stadium or at home walking away saying im just not satisfied im not happy thats what im trying to avoid
2213324 ive made it very clear that im supporting senator obama
2213325 and were working cooperatively on a lot of different matters but delegates can decide to do this on their own they dont need permission
2213326 we create a series of golf challenges that they compete in and each show someone gets eliminated
2213327 at the end were ultimately left with one winner the ultimate prize package will be the break of a lifetime
2213328 i dont know why they printed that because we certainly havent confirmed locations yet
2213329 were not even allowed to talk about it until after the show has been filmed
2213330 were incredibly grateful first of all that they should have saved and guarded this thing for so long and especially that they were generous enough to give this very special item to australia
2213331 the central fact in the largest news story of the month
2213332 im doing something completely normal im publishing the centre of a controversy thats what news magazines do
2213333 the magnitude of sales easily makes it the fastest selling short story collection since records began in 1994 there just isnt anything comparable
2213334 fans have been desperate to own this limited edition piece of harry potter history
2213335 pre orders flooded in from all over the world demand was so big that we stopped taking pre orders to ensure customers had a chance to buy the book in stores
2213336 we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
2213337 i wanted to honour aisha and all the wives of muhammad by giving voice to them remarkable women whose crucial roles in the shaping of islam have so often been ignored
2213338 i am positive that his wealth of experience and dedication to the arts will greatly benefit the organization
2213339 theyve always been on the right side of social justice
2213340 standing with people who didnt have a voice who didnt have a process in the vineyards that is thinking and reflecting our way to a position
2213341 we are asking them to live up to that proud legacy and treat their workers the same way they wanted farmworkers and immigrants treated
2213342 when it comes to their own workers they just believe they know whats best for them
2213343 its classic paternalism they think of themselves as good people on the side of righteousness and for their workers to question that is hard
2213344 we find that theres really either open hostility or passive resistance to unions
2213345 the gap between general principles and practices at the local level
2213346 embarrass and harass the sisters to knuckle down into an agreement
2213347 this is telling us that sales have stabilised this raises some hope that weve flattened out which doesnt mean the problem is solved
2213348 the moaning about a possible recession will increase in the coming weeks
2213349 we are very very happy about the loan guarantee dont get me wrong but the labour based tax credit is a bigger issue for me
2213350 i already know of three companies that are developing feasibility plans to shift operations out of new brunswick
2213351 his banjo could take command and carry everybody along with it
2213352 felt at odds with some of our political stances there was no pressure but he was reading ayn rand and had a libertarian streak
2213353 the dark knight appears to be nothing short of a cultural phenomenon and we are delighted to be a part of it
2213354 looking ahead we believe the combination of having approximately 50 digital systems in operation by year end and the strength of our second half film slate led by the dark knight should drive improved second half financial performance we continue to expect profitability in 2009
2213355 keith and i are both appealing to the press just to give us a little space so we can walk around sydney and show the baby our town
2213356 shes tiny shes like a doll shes like a little little thing just dont photograph right in her face or in our faces because its scary for her
2213357 i have so many outrageous stories too many and im gonna tell em all
2213358 all the unexpurgated brain jangling tales of debauchery sex and drugs transcendence and chemical dependence you will ever want to hear and this is not just my take this is the unbridled truth the in your face up close and prodigious tale of steven tyler straight from the horses lips
2213359 you need to be aware of the code of conduct
2213360 the local government association can deal with recalcitrant elected members or staff
2213361 councils are a cooperation between diverse people with different personalities
2213362 there was a sense of deja vu as the community had previously come together in 2002 in this very same place civic centre to discuss the suspension of birthing services at the hospital and here we are again
2213363 this time however the situation is different as other services have already been removed from our hospital for example emergency surgery and orthopaedic services
2213364 tonight you need to ask yourself is this current closure temporary or the beginning of the end of the hospital as we know it
2213365 the country week expo at rosehill racecourse events centre is a wonderful opportunity for rural and regional areas to sell their areas to sydneysiders as a great place to live work and play
2213366 the iemma governments ongoing support for this annual expo is part of our commitment under the state plan to help country areas grow and prosper
2213367 people who live in the country know whats great about their area so think of five good things about living in your town then give your family and friends in sydney a call and tell them to get along to the expo
2213368 the central west will be represented at the expo by cowra forbes lachlan oberon parkes and weddin shire councils
2213369 representatives from these organisations will showcase the central west region before more than 9000 sydneysiders expected to attend the rosehill expo and what better time to finally make that decision to move to the central west
2213370 expo visitors discover the fabulous lifestyle opportunities available in the central west as well as job and business prospects educational facilities and house and land prices
2213371 country week has generated several success stories for councils in attracting new residents to the central west
2213372 oberon councils participation last year resulted in filling a local horticultural job and three families have also relocated to oberon as a result of councils involvement in the 2005 and 2006 expos
2213373 forbes shire council sold two blocks of land at country week 2007 a chinese family moved to parkes after visiting the event and three jobs were filled in the local mining industry
2213374 research by country week organisers shows people who have had some experience of country living and who have moved to the city are more inclined to return to the country to live
2213375 it is also a great opportunity for all sydneysiders to consider making that sea or tree change theyve always dreamed about the expo will promote how country areas are great places to raise a family in a close knit community plus helping boost the ranks of skilled professionals to provide services to make living in rural nsw even better
2213376 the iemma governments support for the country week expo is part of its assistance program which includes helping communities market themselves and supporting businesses to relocate to or expand in regional nsw
2213377 what i would want to do is to have my justice review the information thats already there emphasis mine and to find out are there inquiries that need to be pursued i cant prejudge that because we dont have access to all the material right now i think that you are right if crimes have been committed they should be investigated youre also right that i would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of republicans as a partisan witch hunt emphasis mine because i think weve got too many problems weve got to solve
2213378 so this is an area where i would want to exercise judgment i would want to find out directly from my attorney general having pursued having looked at whats out there right now emphasis mine are there possibilities of genuine crimes as opposed to really bad policies and i think its important one of the things weve got to figure out in our political culture generally is distinguishing between really dumb policies and policies that rise to the level of criminal activity you know i often get questions about impeachment at town hall meetings and ive said that is not something i think would be fruitful to pursue because i think that impeachment is something that should be reserved for exceptional circumstances now if i found that there were high officials who knowingly consciously broke existing laws engaged in coverups of those crimes with knowledge forefront then i think a basic principle of our constitution is nobody above the law and i think thats roughly how i would look at it

2213410 i cannot recall ever seeing let alone hearing of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted
2213411 i understand being offended voicing your opinion about being offended and not supporting the offending film book store website etc what i dont understand is demanding or expecting that the offender apologize and or alter their creation to avoid any possible insult to you the list of things that people take offense at these days is endless and if every writer or filmmaker took pains to avoid them all wed have nothing but blank books and empty cinemas you say stiller and friends should admit that theyre wrong but theyre not wrong in attempting to entertain are the scenes in poor taste perhaps are they even funny maybe not but are they wrong no bottom line im just happy to see such a long and healthy comment thread that doesnt involve those twilighter retards

2213415 during the 1990s russian energy companies were notorious for cooking their books defrauding their shareholders and using political connections to cover shadowy deals so readers of russian newspapers were not at all surprised over recent stories about an energy giant that was misbehaving in this manner what was unusual was that the company in question was enron as quintessentially american as the texan heartland where it is based
2213416 almost everyone ive talked to says were gonna move to houston what im hearing which is sort of scary is they all want to stay in texas everybody is so overwhelmed by the hospitality and so many of the people in the arenas here you know were underprivileged anyway this is working very well for them

2213419 a move in congress to limit the role of private firms in doling out food stamps is dead for now allowing texas to move forward with its privatization plans u s house and senate negotiators voted late last week against including a privatization ban in a 300 billion farm bill that lawmakers hope to finish this week the ban would have prevented states from allowing employees of private companies to interact with people who are applying for food stamps or to decide someones eligibility for the program

2213427 i use my boobs for everything from getting some new jewelry to getting the attention of the hottest guy in the bar and getting out of speeding tickets
2213428 in the face of impossible odds people who love their country can change it
2213429 its funny to have anybody characterize barack as an elitist
2213430 you know this is the kid who was raised by a single mother who didnt have access to many resources who you know has walked away his entire life from lucrative careers to work in the community
2213431 this guy you know he personifies all of what you know we hope that our kids can be
2213432 ive had a lot of women who are past their teenage years they want to talk about ways in which their friendship has persevered
2213433 i get a lot of stories inspired by the traveling pants
2213434 maybe women have something sent around even a journal that theyll send and then they have rituals like a trip that theyll take every year
2213435 its a generalization but i think we get so much from our friends
2213436 so much support so much just a chance to air out feelings our grievances our joys and i think its important
2213437 were very quick to show our vulnerabilities and our seams in these funny ways in which were put together and i noticed with my own friends how much were eager to say the things that upset us that hurt us that scare us
2213438 i put all the people ive loved everything ive done thought felt in a blender and its a composite in a way of my lifes experience
2213439 but i do tend to blend it up pretty finely
2213440 she never got her period lets put it that way
2213441 i have no plans for the pants to magically reappear to disappear into the pants that was a meaningful decision on my part and in a way im challenging these characters to get by without the pants
2213442 if you suffer from a fear of heights the film really puts you through it
2213443 i still need months of therapy to get over it im sure
2213444 the story was amenable to it because what you have is this sort of criminal conspiracy and people putting on disguises and snooping around the buildings taking photographs and manufacturing false paperwork false i d
2213445 yet the end result is something beautiful its a kind of gift to the city so its a brilliant inversion of the normal crime story when you find that the objective isnt to take something but to give something
2213446 that then started a year long often quite mischievous sometimes very antagonistic collaboration
2213447 its beautiful to see everybody inspired everybody in love again with the twin towers
2213448 this meeting also described what might have been the initial form of the
2213449 let detainee rest just long enough to fall asleep and wake him up about every thirty minutes and tell him its time to pray again
2213450 incredibly the very day that admiral church was investigating conditions at guantanamo and finding the treatment of detainees to be so wonderful detention officials at guantanamo ordered the initiation of the frequent flyer program on mohammad jawad
2213451 jtf guantanamo conducts the safe and humane care and custody of detained enemy combatants legally ethically and transparently
2213452 detainee must be monitored observed and recorded by on duty mps
2213453 we have to assume that the frequent flyer program what its details were was not designed to strengthen the comfort and resolve of the prisoner
2213454 no one actually knows the full scope of the abuses at guantanamo
2213455 this program was approved at the highest levels it suggests that people had simply lost their ability to distinguish right from wrong
2213456 news that this methodology is more widespread than the government has initially acknowledged is troubling but not initially surprising
2213457 things like sleep deprivation are against international law and u s domestic law and all investigators including those in congress need to focus on these issues of programmatic torture
2213458 this thing is a farce i actually stayed in the same house party as alan rickman in tuscany a couple of years ago and he called me to say that he wanted to talk about the paris tasting as he had been asked to play a role in bottle shock i said i guess you are playing one of the senior french judges and he said no im playing you at which point i burst out laughing wished him the best of british luck and rang off i guess this is the last time i have laughed about this since
2213459 the only true elements concerning me in the bottle shock film are my name and those of my two companies
2213460 i know that robert kamen has finished the script of judgment of paris and i believe it is he who now owns the rights to george tabers book so i hope that in due course the true story will be filmed
2213461 i just want to say that never let anybody tell you you cant do anything because no matter what you do you can always go forward the skys the limit
2213462 it shall be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed
2213463 its a light hearted ad that pokes fun at him
2213464 you let people know what makes you tick and what your values and proposals are
2213465 ultimately they will make decisions that will reflect their economic interests and their sense of values
2213466 the antichrist isnt going to be an american so it cant possibly be obama the bible makes it clear he will be from an obscure place like romania
2213467 short of 666 they used every single symbol of the antichrist in this ad
2213468 there are way too many things to just be coincidence
2213469 the first rule of advertising is getting people to watch it
2213470 but until now no one had scientifically looked at how effective they are what precautions should be taken and the dangers involved in simply moving salty water from a salinity affected farm further downstream or into a neighbours land
2213471 the potential for an average or just below average harvest is still there but we are still in the game
2213472 many of the later crops were looking good and the earlier ones are predictably ugly
2213473 the rainfall did little for our dam water situation but i do not think anyone is complaining it was a good soaking rain
2213474 there has been a lot of weeds germinate mainly in the later crops in the past couple of weeks
2213475 with the warm weather and no frosts everything is starting to look great
2213476 run off in to dams has been minimal but our dams are about 25 percent full so that is good
2213477 in many parts of the district rainfall has exceeded the july average
2213478 this has inspired confidence but we must remember that last year we also had a dry may and june an average july and then a dry august
2213479 in other words we still have a long way to go but this rain will maintain yield potential although late sown and late germinating crops will be behind schedule and cannot be expected to catch up
2213480 het hoofddoel is om discussies en debatten te voorzien van correcte informatie want eerlijk gezegd hoor ik veel onzin over wie wat kan claimen
2213481 de meeste kaarten die ik heb gezien in de media zijn heel simpel
2213482 wij hebben geprobeerd alle bij ons bekende claims te verwerken in de kaart zoals afgesproken grenzen tussen landen en gebieden die in de toekomst nog geclaimd zouden kunnen worden
2213483 alle kustlanden aan de noordelijke ijszee hebben recht op de grondstoffen die tot 370 kilometer van hun kustlijn verwijderd zijn
2213484 we hebben speciale geografische software gebruikt om te kijken waar die claims overlappen
2213485 i understood i should consult with my superiors the holy see did not voice any objections and cardinal joseph zen of hong kong encouraged me to go therefore i decided to accept
2213486 however while the leaders of the six largest religions in hong kong were invited to beijing only in the case of the catholic church was an invitation not sent to the highest authority i am embarrassed because our government ignored cardinal zen and invited me instead
2213487 a number of catholic leaders are still in jail or under house arrest
2213488 suffer for our catholic faith and for their fidelity to the holy father
2213489 was mobilized like one big family to help the victims
2213490 i wish china would give the same importance to the five interconnected aspects of democracy human rights the rule of law justice and peace
2213491 we have come here today to speak out against the human rights abuses of the chinese government we have come here today to be a voice to those who are in prison because of their religious beliefs
2213492 end the brutality to those who are forced to go through forced abortions and have no voice we are your voice
2213493 we knelt right there in the middle of tiananmen square and began to pray
2213494 more people gathered around we were having umbrellas shoved in our side kicked the police of course were there
2213495 after a while they took the banner and then they picked us up and physically removed us from tiananmen square and detained us
2213496 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists
2213497 we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
2213498 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
2213499 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
2213500 it is an ideological cultural religious and social army that will be charged with carrying out an intellectual and scientific holy war and to free the minds hearts and souls from the secularist western onslaught and is absolutely prohibited from the use of arms
2213501 they will wait and see what is in the security agreement
2213502 a good and a positive step in the right direction
2213503 the biggest shiite threat to both the iraqi government and the u s led coalition
2213504 now our stance is to watch the political developments and the security agreement
2213505 we will see if there will be a withdrawal timetable or not we will wait for the results these cells have not yet conducted any operations
2213506 there has been some dissent among militiamen when the news first broke about the momahidoun army
2213507 but what muqtada says always turns out at the end to be good
2213508 police call handlers have a vital role to play in ensuring all relevant information is recorded and disseminated to give officers attending scenes as many facts as possible to assist them
2213509 however there is no escaping the fact that some key information was missed
2213510 this was not due to some malicious or deliberate act rather it was due to simple human error a mistake there is no suggestion the outcome would have been any different
2213511 i would ask anyone who recognises any of the men in these photographs to get in touch as soon as possible

2213514 through this information in the online iha university were trying to provide food for thought and discussion that helps our members plan their asian business with foresight
2213515 there also is a movement to bring manufacturing into regional proximity to markets and that benefits u s and mexican manufacturers as well as eastern european manufacturers mexico and the u s are players again
2213516 as countries industrialize they face not only inflation but the growth of the middle class which demands services and goods itself
2213517 in china the government is making policies in many product categories to redirect manufacturing resources to its own markets by increasing tariffs and employing other rules
2213518 many foreign companies in china will develop the sense that the business landscape is shifting beneath their feet the vision of foreign companies departing mexican maquiladoras for the plenty of chinese factories is reminiscent of modern era global corporate nomads countries in asia and south america that understand this movement are increasingly promising future rich gatherings as they align their trade policies to accommodate an influx of foreign direct investment
2213519 companies can no longer afford to focus on one country for their total product
2213520 they need to differentiate not only their product lines but also their country of manufacture to create a safety valve this has been referred to as a china 1 policy
2213521 softness easy care and safety are the most important elements in our infant and baby products
2213522 grouping pieces from the baby line is easy because everything coordinates
2213523 if dbm infests canola early in the season and there is enough warmth to complete three or four generations numbers can quickly build exceeding threshold levels
2213524 if they cant be found in early august the risk of economic damage for the rest of the season is small
2213525 the key to control is to constantly monitor populations from now on
2213526 growers are strongly advised to sample moth numbers using 10 sweeps with a sweep net at four or five different locations within the crop
2213527 if they are found there is potential for numbers to increase and growers must resample and contact their local agronomist for advice
2213528 we discovered that spraying to control the moth should begin at the end of august rather than waiting until late september which had been accepted practice
2213529 in high risk situations a second spray should be applied within seven days of the first

2213544 virtually all conventional pin tumbler locks are vulnerable to this method of attack and frankly nobody has really considered it or looked at it before
2213545 when you have a high security lock you dont expect this to be able to happen
2213546 key control is supposed to make this impossible to happen thats what youre paying for
2213547 basically weve destroyed medecos key control because we can make plastic keys for any of their m3 locks and a lot of their biaxial locks which is their last generation of locks
2213548 youre an employee and you loan it to somebody or your kid takes it off your key ring and makes a copy and tells his friends to break into the facility i can give you a lot of scenarios
2213549 if youre a security manager for the federal reserve or citibank you have a belief that what the company is telling you is true that unless its authorized nobody can reproduce your keys
2213550 so if you give a key to an employee you dont have to worry about it and thats the problem its not true
2213551 this attack you dont kneed to know what youre doing
2213552 basically if someone came to me before and said they could pick a medeco lock id say youre crazy you dont know what youre talking about if they told me they could open it with plastic the same thing id say youre crazy
2213553 locksmiths dont have a clue what is going on your locksmith will tell you this is impossible

2213555 in principle uganda can still file a formal inter party request for the icc to withdraw from a case under article 19 of the rome statute which established the court
2213556 however she said a state party like uganda under the icc has only one opportunity to apply for the international court to withdraw from a case it has already investigated and set to try the suspects
2213557 uganda would have to get right its first application to be allowed to try kony and his commanders
2213558 the government would convince the icc that it is now willing and committed to using its local courts system to try the lra
2213559 government will have to convince and persuade the court icc it has sufficient infrastructure to handle these serious cases

2213566 there was also a heated debate on how to deal with the perpetrators of the violence the mdc wants them to be brought to book
2213567 the parties acknowledging that violence that is attributable to us and which has been injurious to national and human security has indeed occurred in the country after the march 29 2008 harmonised elections hereby call upon all our supporters and members and any organs and structures under the direction and control of our respective parties to stop and desist from the perpetration of violence in any form

2213578 a key cause of conflict is the geographical social and political marginalisation of the agro pastoralist communities living in the eastern equatoria region of sudan and the neighbouring regions of ethiopia uganda and kenya
2213579 these communities suffer from a lack of basic services unreliable water supplies poor leadership depressed local economies insufficient responses to drought widespread poverty and extremely poor health and education
2213580 both actual and perceived levels of insecurity were significantly worse on the kenyan side of the border than they were in south sudan which is recovering from a 21 year civil war
2213581 due to the nomadic nature of the pastoralists they have to move and are often attacked when they cross into areas perceived to belong to other communities
2213582 they should be provided with grants to start other businesses such as jewellery making and cash for work programmes
2213583 by so doing their sons and daughters will know that they do not need to steal livestock
2213584 if the peace aspect is strengthened the communities can work and live together
2213585 besides disarming the people there is also a need to disarm their minds by changing some of their attitudes
2213586 the number of goats being offered is enough to compensate for the money paid to buy the guns
2213587 local residents are being assured that the government will guarantee their security while youths are being informed that cattle raids are not the only means to earn a living
2213588 this is a good day for the tigers the zoo and the people of iraq
2213589 our heart goes out to the two tigers who had to endure the long trip to iraq and a dangerous future at the baghdad zoo
2213590 these tigers will be caged helpless and completely dependent on humans to survive in an area where many people live in fear and are still without access to basic necessities
2213591 we have the utmost concern for the well being of the tigers
2213592 we have full confidence that the baghdad zoo has the staff and facilities to care for them long into the future
2213593 besides none of these sampling artists even knows what a dorian or mixolydian scale is
2213594 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
2213595 there is progress but we have a long way to go
2213596 there is something here for every single constituency to dislike
2213597 we probably wont play as vibrant as role as in years past
2213598 surprise n a it was bound to happen sooner or later
2213599 yeah i went green and 26s on the hybrid smoke so much green that i cant open up my eyelids
2213600 wake up in london go to sleep on atlanta time still my paint got more candy than your valentine
2213601 trouble i dont shy away from it i annihilate suckas in their driveway in church on sunday morning praying bout what happened friday
2213602 basically were naming everything girls like in a song so when you hear it youll understand exactly what im talking about if you dont know what girls like then im going to tell you in this song im going to let you know exactly what they like just give you a couple points its going to help you with the entire rest of your life thats what its going to help you with for sure
2213603 were in the works of doing a whole lot of very creative stuff
2213604 the whole album every song is a movie thats basically how it comes down i dont even have features on the album the first single is not even featuring chris brown and sean garrett its co starring chris brown and sean garrett thats what i have on this album its all stars basically its co starring people because its a movie every song is a movie creatively and conceptually i think people are definitely going to understand that this is something that was very creatively put together it took a minute but every song is very serious
2213605 they moved out of b space so it increased the b vacancy or kept it high
2213606 then they moved into a space and it decreased the a vacancies there
2213607 i think those are excellent values in the marketplace and they would be the kind of space that would be absorbed over the next six months
2213608 with the technology now available to all of us families not in the public eye also can have their own media memories
2213609 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
2213610 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
2213611 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
2213612 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2213613 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2213614 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2213615 once again after study of our business model with storesonline express and pro we have been able to resolve a long standing dispute we are pleased this matter has been resolved and we intend to return to north carolina shortly
2213616 recent data suggested that the slowdown has taken a firmer hold of the economy and the olympics may present some downside risks
2213617 as the domestic and external uncertainties rise worries about a sharper than expected economic slowdown loom large and the government has changed its tone on macro policy recently
2213618 when building a team i first search for people who love to win if i cant find any of those i then look for people who hate to lose
2213619 bought loans that were on some level just as risky as what was subprime
2213620 we expected credit would continue to deteriorate and it has admittedly even faster than we thought
2213621 no intention to get down below the minimum capital level
2213622 needs to raise capital today not wait and hope for a chance to raise cheaper capital in the future
2213623 were managing the firm to not have to access the government support
2213624 im tired of everyone else harping on 4 a gallon for gas
2213625 weve been paying that for four years when everybody else was paying 2 a gallon
2213626 we are taking care of the challenges we have in alaska on our own
2213627 if we had to go to the store and buy everything wed probably be on food stamps by now if we didnt have our land and sea animals
2213628 more and more our take home pay is going to be spent buying gas to go get caribou to go get fish to go to our camps and gather our food
2213629 normally i run into six or more boats on the water this time
2213630 where i went on the kobuk i was the only one there im still wondering how many of us will be able to go hunting moose and caribou this year
2213631 we could be going back to dog teams if we cant afford the cost of gas for subsistence hunting
2213632 sometimes ill read for half an hour sometimes more i give special voices to each character and try to make it sound over the top i might use a guitar song or heavy metal music then it goes online and people can download it for free
2213633 the only way to get peoples attention these days is to give them something for free
2213634 if someone walks into a bookstore why would they pick up a scott sigler when theres a stephen king they wont so i give my content away give readers a chance to try it for free and if they like my stuff then guess what theyll go out and buy the book
2213635 i was working in it marketing and had discovered podcasting when not many people knew about it
2213636 my theory was that i knew there was a market for my stuff i knew some people would like it so long as i could get it out there if enough people listened a percentage of them would become fans and four or five years down the line theyd pay to buy my books thats pretty much what happened
2213637 with no marketing budget no advertising no media coverage and an artist nobodys heard of we managed to drive it up to no 7
2213638 now hopefully im ahead of the game by the time people like stephen king wake up to the internet theyll be on an equal playing field to people like me
2213639 we see solid growth for the prominent apple 3g iphone driven notably by its evolving economics iphone now unlocked greater subsidies leading to lower retail price and no geographic exclusivity
2213640 its very rewarding to see something thats been such a big part of my life for the past year and a half finally reach an audience
2213641 we got to shoot in locations and work with people we never thought possible
2213642 and i am thrilled to show this film to all those who helped this project reach its full potential
2213643 you never can guess what people will do until it plays in front of an audience
2213644 we know what we think is funny but audiences can feel differently
2213645 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2213646 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2213647 is not in any deal talks with any big companies and apparently wont be a bidder for data storage giant emc corp john t chambers told
2213648 have any negotiations with any large companies under way at this time
2213649 yet ciscos portfolio approach and diversification across geographies and product segments seem to be working well as evidenced by its strong revenue growth
2213650 chambers had said just a month ago how most of their customers were discussing a rebound in 2009 certainly not in the second half of 2008
2213651 theres a sell the rips buy the dips mentality out there
2213652 im much happier when i can sell a big rally and then buy it back because the trend is still to the downside i only want to be in certain stocks for a few days right now because generally were not seeing two week moves
2213653 marvell is one that seems to circulate every four months
2213654 as we get closer and closer to expiration i believe less and less of what i hear
2213655 it has a healthy balance sheet and long term growth perspectives earnings have disappointed but current multiple is much lower than historical average
2213656 education should be the engine of social mobility but most schools in the poorest areas are officially classified by the government as failing and children eligible for free school meals are nearly 200 times more likely to leave school without a single grade c at gcse than they are to get three as at a level
2213657 the gap between rich and poor is closing and it is misleading to claim otherwise
2213658 we are investing a huge amount of time and energy into helping bring low performing schools up to standard
2213659 the stark divide in achievement between the most well off children and the rest
2213660 herrschaftszeiten ist dieser dauergrinsende bursche mit yuppie attitude denn komplett druff
2213661 dictates whims and caprices and territorial imbued hegemonic aspirations of war mongers of some ethnic group in the region
2213662 government has ceaselessly embarked on the mission of appeasing only the ijaw ethnic group to the detriment of all the other ethnic groups in the niger delta such that they are uncharitably consigned to endlessly wait for the crumbs from the table of the master tribe when it is clear that no crumb will ever fall
2213663 is a precipitate of what it described as the present mind set of the government to the effect that niger delta region is synonymous with the ijaw ethnic group
2213664 the niger delta development commission nddc for example has become synonymous with ijaws given the fact that the two most important positions the managing director and director of administration and finance among other key positions have become the exclusive preserve of those of ijaw extraction
2213665 why the federal government has not realised the futility of its pro ijaw appeasement strategy particularly when experience has shown that the more the ijaws are appeased the more the militants amongst them are encouraged into recklessness ethnic cleansing blood letting and territorial expansionism
2213666 the federal government must not be oblivious of the recent history of the region specifically those pro ijaw appeasement actions of governments all of which smacks of legality and justice and have not yielded any positive dividend
2213667 the united states has embarked on a program of secret research on biological weapons that some officials say tests the limits of the global treaty banning such weapons
2213668 the bank reporting season culminating in the rbs figures has painted an ugly picture of what a mess the banks and consumers are in
2213669 borrowers are being hammered by the same lenders who only a year ago were only too happy to hand over loans the bank of england has cut rates again and again but the lenders are paying no attention as they raise rates on loans mortgages current accounts and credit cards
2213670 the irony is that there are still good deals out there for borrowers but only to people with good credit records
2213671 as the banks look to put their houses back in order it will be the consumer whose household suffers as the increased charges on credit cards and other lending passes the impact of losses on you can bank on it that any losses will be recouped by higher charges being levied on their customers
2213672 as always those with poorer credit rating will suffer more than the ones who can afford the increased charges
2213673 im very focused on what were doing here and whats right for our customers shareholders and people weve steered it through good times and well steer it through these times
2213674 with one voice developing economies of scale in the creative process maximising local effectivenes zed interface on top of internet explorer
2213675 traces the life of aisha prophet mohammeds child bride from her engagement to mohammed when she was six until the prophets death
2213676 although divers found a heavy object that was of interest to the investigation it is not thought to be significant at this stage but will be looked at further
2213677 we have been in touch with dannys family and kept them fully up to date with how the search went
2213678 the thing we want most of all is to be able to find dannys body and allow his family to bury him
2213679 i think wright probably pushed it too is what im hearing
2213680 back then the average two bay station was 5 000 this was 20 000
2213681 you come over the hill there and theres that gas station right on the corner it was perfect
2213682 especially when they first put the copper roof on it glowed of course then we treated it to turn it green
2213683 as long as you have a dynamic design it doesnt matter if youre doing a house a gas station or a cathedral
2213684 originally the pumps were going to come directly from the ceiling so youd pull it down like a shower
2213685 wright talks about mothers milk and coming up to the udders and feeding your car from this which i think is a glorious image
2213686 wright talks about as long as you have a dynamic design it doesnt matter if youre doing a house a gas station or a cathedral
2213687 he imagined that all of us would come in and wed spend time together here because it would be a social center a cultural center
2213688 people just dont want to sit around and wait theres plenty of other things to do
2213689 theres shopping its certainly a central locale but its just not done
2213690 were proud that our grandfather and parents were interested enough in architecture to have something like this built
2213691 at the same time weve always been a little ashamed because it takes so much money to keep this thing up every time you turn around its 20 000 for this and 20 000 for that
2213692 it gives you a chance to know about beijings weather in summers we have very diversified weather conditions like sunny days foggy days or rainy days
2213693 since july especially from july 20 we have implemented temporary pollution control measures so it is safe to say that today the pollution level is very much lower than before therefore improved air quality is a natural result
2213694 maybe the fog makes it not a nice picture to look at the birds nest or the water cube but the monitor south of the two stadiums reads the api at 80 today it conveyed a strong message that our efforts had paid off since august
2213695 im confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in beijing
2213696 seven years of preparation will boil down to this single big show and every one is waiting
2213697 there is so much expectation weighing down but inevitably itll be a fluent and spectacular show of the olympic spirit and the culture of the host country
2213698 the opening ceremony will tell a chinese story with a globally understood language but it will not be a simple exhibition nor history lesson
2213699 the athens games opening ceremony was an aesthetic feat and was a very cool show
2213700 but the beijing show will be another kind of cool
2213701 we have to use four grams to move a thousand kilos
2213702 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2213703 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2213704 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2213705 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2213706 whatever decision is made its going to be a collaborative decision
2213707 i think all this sort of speculation is much ado about very little
2213708 were just working out the details however those details play out that doesnt change the bottom line the fact that everyones on the same team here
2213709 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2213710 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2213711 i saw trash cans go down the road and then i happened to go to the back and all of a sudden a swirling motion began up above our house and fences and everything started lifting up out of the ground
2213712 i saw debris flying whole fence pieces flying up above the houses
2213713 i told her to get away from the windows and go in the hallway to be more protected
2213714 being from florida and mississippi ive seen these before its mainly just staying away from the windows and staying in a place where nothing can hurt you
2213715 the legislation is there for a reason to stop the spread of the disease
2213716 during an avian influenza outbreak when there are significant concerns about the about the disease and the implications for other farmers breaking the rules is a very serious offence
2213717 during an outbreak even greater care should have been taken and clearly it wasnt by mr buchanan
2213718 we very much regret our involvement in this offence and accept the sentence imposed by the court
2213719 we wish to make it abundantly clear that these offences are not linked with the avian influenza outbreak in 2007
2213720 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2213721 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2213722 if youre familiar with the idea of a mini blog that pretty much summarizes rejaw
2213723 habe ich einen blog gelesen kenne ich ein drittel der anderen blogbeitraege
2213724 time is not yet for us to go public on the matter
2213725 if henry okah is tormented to a certain point the ndpvf will be forced to wage two different kinds of war
2213726 will be the destruction of all oil wells in the niger delta including the demolition of all offshore oil platforms in the region as well as making sure that no oil tanker from outside the country goes outside the region with any petroleum product
2213727 the second war will be the formal declaration of the niger delta republic in accordance with the kaiama declaration
2213728 i will continue from where major isaac adaka boro stopped i will fight until the niger delta is free
2213729 we are not criminals we are not sea pirates we are not bandits we are freedom fighters fighting for the freedom of the niger delta region nobody will call nelson mandela a criminal nobody will call martin luther king a bandit
2213730 nelson mandela was anointed to deliver south africa during the racist regime martin luther struggled for the equality of the human race when discrimination and segregation was ruling the world
2213731 we salute the position taken by the negotiators in denouncing violence we hope the supporters will take the call seriously and observe peace what the political parties have done shows political maturity and that is commendable
2213732 the idea of taking facilitators to court is not only unintelligent but was counter productive we need to give due recognition to president mbeki for the sterling work he has done for the country
2213733 it shows that negotiations are going on well in the spirit of a memorandum of understanding signed by the three principals we are now emphasising on nationhood and one family as zimbabweans that there should be a strong bond among zimba bweans regardless of ones political affiliation
2213734 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2213735 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2213736 i dont think too many people question that i think a lot of people question what happened this offseason
2213737 you see teams go out in free agency and spend on a lot of guys and everyone says oh theyre going to be great and go to the super bowl it takes chemistry and to me thats the most important thing you can have all the talent in the world but if the chemistry is not there it wont matter
2213738 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2213739 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2213740 you win the super bowl and i promise you will get a key
2213741 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2213742 he still has the utmost amount of respect from the guys in this locker room here and we wish him well wish him a good season and hope to see him in tampa
2213743 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2213744 it is good to have him here when you play with a legend you cant help but feed off of it i think hell fit right in with both the team and the city
2213745 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year
2213746 simple stories to make sure everyone gets them but still not too simple to make sure everyone gets them in a different way
2213747 im so used to keeping my eye on you i would never have been able to concentrate
2213748 how can you swing a club let alone get a hole in one after breaking your ribs your hip and shoulder thats amazing you had me thinking you might not even walk again
2213749 there appears to be a coordinated and widespread effort in virginia to commit voter fraud
2213750 as we gain more experience with the surgical technique and the design of the limbs we see the possible benefits for humans implants that allow the prosthetic limbs to attach without chafing or irritation and limbs with more natural ranges of motion we believe that this is the future of prosthetics
2213751 there has been a cascade of nuclear accidents in france over the last two months
2213752 the fact that in both incidents at the socatri plant there was a delay before the public was informed raises some serious questions about the corporate behavior of areva a company that has multiple nuclear contracts in the u s
2213753 congress needs to pull the plug before even more taxpayer money is wasted
2213754 his corporation has left the public vulnerable to a radiation accident for all these years while claiming safety is their top priority now we find out his new plants would cut corners too
2213755 this government is in no way founded on christian principles
2213756 police say cheye calvo and his wife appeared to be victims of a plan by two men to smuggle millions of dollars worth of marijuana by having it delivered to about a half dozen unsuspecting recipients
2213757 the case is the latest embarrassment for prince georges county law enforcement a former police officer was sentenced in may to 45 years in prison for shooting two furniture deliverymen at his home last year one of them fatally he claimed that they attacked him
2213758 thousands of friends and supporters put their faith in him especially the young people the message of the campaign was right the message was still worth fighting for
2213759 when i became president i inherited many things including the decision to use the bomb i was just carrying out what the previous president wanted
2213760 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2213761 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it
2213762 avevi gi visto quel bhe quello che ha usato la ragazza
2213763 non avevo mai visto un risultato cosi devastante in condizioni normali avrebbe dovuto solo annullare la stregoneria che ci veniva scagliato contro
2213764 in condizioni in cui entrambi gli avversari sono di pari livello
2213765 ed ha anche detto che se ci attaccherai non sar per tua volont ma per una maledizione

2213831 from the prequel i am not working on but that was fun
2213832 if it was mutt williams it would be mutt williams and the search for elvis or something
2213833 i have an idea to make shia the lead character next time and have harrison come back like sean connery did in the last movie
2213834 the franchise really depends on me coming up with a good idea
2213835 we are not quite sure where we are returning from
2213836 we respect and support the bands decision and have complied with their request to be removed from this years shortlist
2213837 and for legal and practical purposes the pair have been separated since december 2007
2213838 part of this is that there was too much money coming in people who wanted to be in the glamorous film business and partly because everybody was hoping on new media
2213839 a few years ago i was talking to various people who were saying people have so much money that they want to invest in hollywood films we dont know what to do with it
2213840 im thinking the result is there are too many movies for example last year there were 747 movies released in the united states thats an average of two movies a day its too many
2213841 theres no way that all of those movies are going to make money
2213842 so i think hollywoods going to cut back and get a little smarter on how they market things
2213843 george lucas wrote the rules way back in the late 70s and basically he leased his star wars movies to fox fox released it they got a distribution fee but he owns that property
2213844 you have to be in a real superstar category steven spielberg george lucas to get those kind of terms
2213845 its going to be necessary because it is getting more and more expensive
2213846 with that said its kind of a shame because the beauty of what were doing here is we have the unique opportunity of one vision
2213847 i think it was the very first real sort of teenage soap opera and it paved the way for everything
2213848 right after 90210 party of five came out the oc was almost a complete carbon copy of 90210
2213849 oh my gosh shannen doherty was such a handful im really happy shes going back to the show
2213850 if they do it right itll attract all the old viewers and all the new viewers watching the new young cast
2213851 its always nice to have someone new to write about
2213852 its gonna have to be a bit more racy than it was before
2213853 it used to be this week theres a very special drug story and it would be some random person that wasnt even in the show
2213854 the biggest lesson we learned from last year is that we need more toilets
2213855 this year we know what to anticipate and booking bands has been a lot easier because we know what we like
2213856 we have a couple of search tents but we had no problems last year there is also a big police presence outside of the fence
2213857 well its one day in the year when none of the media can get in and monitor us its just one day when teenagers can get away from their parents and have fun and listen to music
2213858 it sucks you get that everywhere in england i think 7 000 people is big enough for us to be honest
2213859 ive always been terrified of the consequences of smoking now im a year older and more terrified than ever
2213860 i had wonderful times while i was drinking and i wrote a lot of my plays when i was pretty well drunk
2213861 i find the moments of pleasure so important they decrease as you get older but they become more precious
2213862 when the history of the stage is written cell mates will become the most famous play i ever wrote
2213863 were delighted to have secured the rights to fringe which we believe will thrill a new generation of viewers much like the x files did 15 years ago
2213864 i wasnt saying i was better than jay z as a person or rock was greater than hip hop as a thing or whatever it is
2213865 when dogg was satisfied with the scale of the film he agreed to be a part of it the song was filmed with his sensibility and he had creative control
2213866 this is snoop dogg singh is the king this is the thing
2213867 yo what up this big snoop dogg represent the punjabi aye ya hit em with this
2213868 robbie coltrane is not the burglar but imagine him aged 16 with lank greasy hair and you have the picture
2213869 this is a picture of english actor robbie coltrane who you may remember from the harry potter films or the award winning british drama cracker
2213870 because of the children and young persons act 1989 police cannot show you a picture of the 16 year old burglar operating in your neighbourhood
2213871 he is 16 years old lives locally travels by bicycle and burgles houses in your street
2213872 he will break windows to gain entry and ransack the property targeting electronic items cash and jewellery
2213873 i have to be in delhi for renewing my indian visa but my heart is in calcutta
2213874 we have to assess the situation because her coming back may provoke violence again
2213875 the real triumph of this tour is that we havent strangled each other
2213876 not to say it hasnt crossed my mind or andys or stewarts
2213877 owned the music yet the music was used without permission in a mary j blige release recording
2213878 this will be one of the greatest scientific experiments as well as the most expensive ever conducted on earth which fingers crossed will reveal truths about existence guessed at but never demonstrated
2213879 russian armoured vehicles have entered the northern suburbs of tskhinvali
2213880 they have been calling it training exercises but they have not been concealing the fact that they are training these troops for use inside georgia
2213881 the way the escalation went was we came first under extensive artillery barrage from the separatists but in the end i was told that russian armoured vehicles started to cross the georgian border and that was exactly the moment when i had to take this decision to fire back
2213882 i want to reiterate on his behalf that the united states supports georgias territorial integrity and we call for an immediate ceasefire
2213883 about 1 400 died we will check these figures but the order of the numbers is around this we have this on the basis of reports from relatives
2213884 he is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia
2213885 if he is going to start a war he is going to lose the support of a lot of friends in the west
2213886 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2213887 we feel theres a serious intention by the american forces for a withdrawal timetable at the very least
2213888 it should not be considered an end to the mehdi army but its a halfway step to dissolving the mehdi army if the u s began to implement a withdrawal timetable we shall complete the path to dissolution
2213889 it is a good step to repair our mistakes especially sectarianism and sectarian killings we are very sorry about these sectarian killings because some parties supported this violence for their own advantage
2213890 to renounce violence and participate peacefully in the iraqi political process
2213891 as of last night the schedule was one of the issues being discussed between the two sides there is no agreement yet but this is what the iraqis are asking for
2213892 if we find this does not happen and the u s forces change their stance over the timetable we can change direction also
2213893 this will not mean ending the ceasefire it will depend on whats going on on the ground
2213894 congo wants to preserve its protected spaces it needs the best expertise if that expertise comes from outside i dont see why we should be reticent we dont have any hang ups in that respect
2213895 im under no illusion over how difficult it is the glimmer of hope is that we have a very strong team of rangers on the ground
2213896 therefore reducing methane production is an attractive short term target for mitigating global warming
2213897 whatever happens the opening ceremony will continue we have contingency plans for temporary showers rain and drizzle
2213898 in the second rehearsal we had some rain but if the rain gets heavier some things will be modified or readjusted
2213899 victims whom i have met with continue to complain of headaches skin lesions nose throat and lung problems as well as digestive problems
2213900 i am very concerned about the situation especially for women who have complained of an increase in premature births early menopause and miscarriages since the dumping occurred
2213901 i think spooks fans will like it because the thing about spooks is youve got agents at the top of their game and theyre going in there doing an amazing job
2213902 in this programme youve got six rookies that could be anyone and theyre really finding their way and youre seeing them grow and progress throughout the series
2213903 you really have that sense of this could be me
2213904 personally all the paparazzi and press doesnt mean anything to me
2213905 you see something and then youve been with the person at the time so why would you be affected by it because its absolutely rubbish
2213906 you dont get any bigger than the grammys it was absolutely mind blowing and when she won she kind of threw herself in my brothers arms
2213907 we were all jumping around it was like being at a football match and somebody had scored a goal it was fire
2213908 as an actor its great fun getting involved in the script breaking it down doing your research for the background and going and performing and working with other actors
2213909 this morning two planes were delayed for half an hour because the visibility was only 200 meters 656 ft because smoke and smog shrouded the airport
2213910 opens the way for even more geothermal development and is just one step in our continuing effort to responsibly use and develop clean renewable energy
2213911 it looks like supply is going to come in considerably ahead of demand for the next year to next year and a half
2213912 i believe it to be the biggest deal thats been done
2213913 we are at a fairly early stage of this but there are areas of the iranian economy that are vulnerable to targeted sanctions whether they be in the lng liquefied natural gas sector investment in the oil and gas sector imported refined products reinsurance other financial areas which are areas we would look at if we are looking to increase the pressure on the iranian leadership
2213914 a number of other countries that we would want to involve in those discussions as we go forward
2213915 no illusions that it will be difficult as it was last time to actually agree the text of some tough sanctions in the security council
2213916 we have said we will continue looking to see how best to apply pressure to the iranian regime and we will continue to do that
2213917 as the tropics warm are seeing an increased frequency in the heaviest rainfall
2213918 implying that projections of future changes in rainfall extremes may be underestimated
2213919 for the next two and a half weeks almost all you ll hear in the news will be related to the 29th olympiad in beijing
2213920 beyond this in 2010 we will see the world expo in shanghai and the asian games in guangzhou
2213921 china has been gearing up for the games for the past few years finally with a dozen new sports stadiums and a cross city underground railway to ferry visitors to different venues china will be on display to the world
2213922 if you ve been investing internationally you re no stranger to china depending on when you bought you may either love it or hate it for instance in 2007 chinese stocks rocketed up the charts 97
2213923 in 2006 the gains were even more impressive at 130 but it hasn t been all fun and games in the past two years china peaked at the same time u s stocks in october 2007
2213924 since then their indexes have dropped substantially nearly 40 much more than the s amp p 500 investors in chinese equities have taken a bath over the last year but that doesn t mean it s over for asian giant so why is it time to consider china again
2213925 for one the olympics will showcase china to the world in the next 18 days the middle kingdom will host more visitors in its cities than at any time in history
2213926 half a million wealthy attendees from all over the globe will descend upon beijing shanghai qinhuangdao shenyang tianjin and hong kong en masse
2213927 it will be a unique opportunity for china to highlight its stability and economic viability to international business leaders after growth stunting decades of mao led communism
2213928 but thats not all in 2010 the world expo in shanghai and the asian games in guangzhou are expected to bring in more visitors and stimulate more construction than even the olympics china has already spent nearly 35 billion on the olympics
2213929 they are expected to spend more on the other two events what does this mean for the chinese economy in the words of the u s government economic stimulus
2213930 since 1988 the host country s stock market rose an average 38 in the year following a summer olympics the chinese market has been down since last october but china won t be down forever
2213931 since 1978 china has been revamping its infrastructure to be more business friendly the government realizes that cash is king in international finance
2213932 their government has been raising capital by depressing their domestic currency yuan and increasing exports to countries like the u s
2213933 it s worked as of may china reportedly has 1 6 trillion on hand to stimulate their economic interests recently the chinese government has been strategically deploying cash to protect their market
2213934 in the past few months efforts have begun to take root no doubt as a result of chinese government intervention china seems ready to defend investors against any further decline
2213935 just like in the u s chinese consumers are the backbone of the economy however chinese consumers are not like american consumers consider this
2213936 cash rich chinese consumers can afford to spend more because they have more to spend it s just a matter of convincing consumers to part with savings for more goods and services
2213937 that problem is easier to solve than funding an economy with more debt that s why china looks more attractive than any other investment on the horizon
2213938 right now it looks very attractive the recent chart shows consolidation with an apparent double bottom in place trading over 19 million shares per day fxi is the most liquid chinese etf available
2213939 by downloading the theme users are submitting an application to join the playstation home beta test community we will be using a variety of criteria including activity on the playstation network to determine eligibility for the beta community
2213940 theres an aerosmith game out there thats super successful and if somebodys gonna follow that up were talking and its exciting and the people at guitar hero and activision are rapidly becoming our best new friends in the world you can put the rest of it together yourself
2213941 metacritic isnt always the best quality measure for some licensed games but i know a good game when i see it
2213942 my team and our developers know a good game when we see it the products were putting out this year from hasbro i dont know how theyre going to do with metacritic but theyre innovative theyre different
2213943 weve got the first e rated shooter with our nerf game
2213944 i ve always been a big fan of putting into the market on a regular basis regardless of what is happening in the overall market
2213945 if i ve learned anything in the more than a quarter of a century of following the markets it is this fact
2213946 but our emotions usually take control thus making it very dif cult to pull the trigger and put money into the market when stocks are falling
2213947 that s why i ve always been a big fan of 401 k plans with these investment vehicles investment programs are put on autopilot with dollars being put into the market on a regular basis usually each paycheck regardless of what is happening in the overall market
2213948 fortunately investors can duplicate the autopilot feature of 401 k plans with their drip investments by taking advantage of automatic monthly investment features provided by most drips
2213949 under this feature investors can set up automatic investments via electronic debit of their bank accounts each month for investors who use this feature drip plans usually reward them with a number of bene ts
2213950 for example it is not unusual for a firm to waive the minimum initial investment amount if an investor is willing to agree to automatic monthly investments via electronic debit from their bank account
2213951 however disney will waive this amount if an investor agrees to automatic monthly investment of at least 100 the ability to invest smaller amounts via electronic debit increases the accessibility of many drip plans
2213952 firms usually charge a lower fee on shares purchased with automatic monthly investment returning to our disney example the rm charges drip participants a fee of 5 for shares purchased with a check however shares purchased via automatic monthly investment are charged a fee of just 1
2213953 true if you choose to invest via automatic monthly investment you are committed to making regular monthly investments however your requirement usually extends only until you invest the amount that equals the minimum initial investment
2213954 for example if you choose to make automatic monthly investments in the disney plan you need to make those automatic investments until you reach disney s minimum initial investment amount of 1 000 that would mean a minimum of 10 monthly investments of 100 each
2213955 the following autopilot drip portfolio contains 10 quality stocks all of these companies permit initial purchases directly and all reduce their minimum initial investment amount if an investor agrees to automatic monthly investment via electronic debit of a bank account
2213956 maria ja maria ich war grad im funkloch im funkloch ei ja ich war grad in so nem funkloch
2213957 ive just been blown away by the amount of support ive received and very grateful to everyone at the eden fundraiser
2213958 a day like really shows how the community rallies together in tough times
2213959 i have a family myself and i was very touched when approached by libby bates and kathy baker
2213960 if its not war then we are very close to it
2213961 the russians have invaded georgia and we are under attack
2213962 i just left last thursday and i had occasion to talk to one of the ladies there and already right now they sound swamped to tell you the truth
2213963 its quite a program because they keep people aboard who seem to have been good employees
2213964 the few i know about are in pretty high level jobs
2213965 hiring someone as a retired annuitant gives us a cost effective way to hire a retired professional with a proven track record of public service
2213966 they can be put to work in any part of state operations usually to supplement additional needs in highly specialized areas annuitants allow us to quickly tap into a workforce with years of experience to staff up or down as needed at that time
2213967 this year its mojado so you could take a political bent if you wanted to
2213968 x you know how we have been talking about what kinds of things can be barriers to you having successful social relationships with others and family members well these jokes that you tell are actually quite offensive to me and i would prefer it if you didnt tell them to me this is an example of the kind of behaviour that can become a barrier to having meaningful relationships with others our sessions have been making some great progress however i do feel uncomfortable when you share these inappropriate jokes with me afterwards
2213969 counsellors are responsible for setting and monitoring boundaries throughout the counselling sessions and will make explicit to clients that counselling is a formal and contracted relationship and nothing else
2213970 sb 375 would become the vehicle to implement the land use portion of ab 32
2213971 it would carry out the draft scoping plan for the land use sector
2213972 we will just set targets it will be up to the locals to implement the plans that meet those targets
2213973 im proud that local governments housing builders environmental advocates and others all recognize that to reduce greenhouse gasses and promote a better way of life our communities must change the way they grow
2213974 the governor talked about 18 million metric tons at one point
2213975 it concerns me that were really missing an opportunity to do more
2213976 this bill sets forward goals and objectives on a regional level but leaves decisions to the jurisdictions themselves
2213977 this bill lets the arb set targets for greenhouse gas emissions but all planning decisions will be left to the local governments
2213978 the arb is pursuing a wide range of ideas without a firm grasp of the economic costs
2213979 i dont know how we can honestly evaluate the strategies in the scoping plan without that analysis
2213980 my main criticism is that the plan was not nearly detailed enough the discussions that went on between arb staff and other stakeholders were on a much more detailed level than what was reflected in the plan
2213981 political chat room of the governors with lots of flash and dash
2213982 the electricity infrastructure was damaged in a number of places caused mainly by debris being blown onto the network which left many people without power
2213983 the main powerline which supplies the eden area was hit hard by the strong winds with major repairs necessary at millingandi where wires had been brought down by trees
2213984 now that the smoke is gone we just need to get rid of the mirrors and we might get a budget deal
2213985 no public employee or member of the public shall smoke any tobacco product inside a public building or in an outdoor area within 20 feet of a main exit entrance or operable window of a public building
2213986 i have told everybody that if they want to spend one weekend or the other in denver go right ahead but dont plan to be there for the democratic national convention i dont see this ending for quite some time
2213987 they republicans have a huge list of we dont like ems but they have not brought anything up they said they want a hard spending cap there is no proposal they say they want to borrow and they only come up with 3 or 4 billion to close an 8 billion gap so everything they want to do they have refused or failed to provide a proposal
2213988 as for our negotiations being at a loggerhead we have not had a big 4 in two weeks the majority party controls the agenda we are here ready to work anytime for as long as it takes
2213989 anybody who is laid off or terminated is eligible to file for unemployment benefits
2213990 created a mess thats going to ripple down to every part of the economy
2213991 did anyone consider the big picture effect this will have on california
2213992 if they think theyve got problems with mortgage foreclosures now they aint seen nothin yet
2213993 the state gets a bargain and a half from us and the permanent employees appreciate us because theres too much work for them they dont resent us they appreciate us
2213994 you dont often see the democratic party the republican party the california league of conservation voters and the chamber of commerce all in opposition
2213995 clearly many of the groups in opposition are groups with an indisputable record of support for renewable energy
2213996 im aware of no renewable energy company or environmental group with a record of involvement in renewable energy who has any support for this initiative
2213997 for reasons that i still dont understand and the campaign has never explained they changed the definition of eligible renewable resource under the california renewable energy mandate
2213998 they added the phrase solar and clean energy which is the initiative brand
2213999 we feel they are flat out lying about some of the provisions
2214000 we think we can plainly show through independent experts that its a lie
2214001 there is no basis for creating such a rigid policy for such a complicated matter
2214002 when the music is good youre moved to tears because everyone remembers a time when they were all alone and you felt you were the only gay person on the planet
2214003 we had already seen some of the very best that gala has to offer those large city choruses are big most with over 100 singers and we were only 21 but im happy to say we were the little chorus that could
2214004 it has impacts on this office in terms of salaries some of us might not get paid because of the budget it will affect people but in terms of what we do the budget source is there
2214005 once proposition 1b passed about two years ago part of those funds we managed were for port and maritime security which was about 100 million last year and might be this too
2214006 we used to get 100 000 in antiterrorism funding and thats our only source of non federal non bond money
2214007 nevertheless we still try to watch what we spend on leaves and overnight stays
2214008 all our money goes directly to supporting first responders to provide equipment or training exercise they need
2214009 i know the whole gym thing came up but we didnt use a single dollar of our funds for that
2214010 were working on one more build out of office space there will be 135 when we get final
2214011 we convened over a dozen hearings to talk about those issues on services and response and what was repeatedly said by first responder and professionals in disaster management was how helpful it would be if oes and ohs were merged into one
2214012 very important role in government and has gotten more important since 9 11 creation of the direction of oes and ohs on the governors cabinet would be important theyd still be autonomous roles but with direct access
2214013 they do a good job in coordinating getting resources out and distributing equipment
2214014 i dont think were spending too much to protect ourselves
2214015 robustness of our system requires robust plans to prevent deter and respond to any disaster
2214016 i was shocked and dismayed that something like that would have happened
2214017 at the very least you would think that california strategies would reveal their potential conflict of interests
2214018 i understand the confusion because the early media report mischaracterized the nature of these separate agreements
2214019 our advocates are lobbying on behalf of the city and the city only and we are proud to represent them through this fiscal crisis
2214020 separate and apart from that our consulting firm had an agreement to provide strategic consulting advice to the developer were talking about different clients different contracts no one at this firm has ever lobbied for mr keenan nor has mr keenan attending any lobbying meetings
2214021 its been clear that this isnt going to go through the senate without some changes
2214022 whose interests is areias representing there is a clear divergence there
2214023 in every field you can imagine there is always the general principle that you cannot serve two masters
2214024 if this conflict of interest was not a big issue then why not reveal it
2214025 to gain food to gain increased access to physical resources like nesting sites or space to avoid caring for unrelated offspring infanticide may also be due to aggression or to disturbances in the physical or social environment for example when female voles mink and other mammals are in a state of psychological stress they may eat their young
2214026 if there is money in a solution theres more money in prolonging the solution
2214027 lead the charge to kill this very real and very threatening proposal
2214028 i have just chosen to take the reins of my career
2214029 we have a different view and mind set im doing it and im handling it and very happy very happy with it
2214030 i dont know what the repercussions are in terms of 2014
2214031 we have to reconfigure and move forward how i dont know yet
2214032 our real focus is on whats in front of us this moment
2214033 were working on getting a formal development agreement and then using city resources to allow us to get an architect design team and construction manager on board
2214034 living with fire fire ecology and policy for the twenty first century
2214035 does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
2214036 there seems to be a little confusion on teh internets about what sweetcron actually is
2214037 all necessary action to clarify the incident and a further statement will follow after the second sample is analyzed
2214038 it gave no more details officials at the anti doping council were not available for comment
2214039 look where the stock market is headed if inspite of this the sponsor has agreed to come on board we should respect his decision
2214040 despite several attempts sanjay labroo chairman and managing director of asahi india glass ltd could not be reached for his comments like in its first year the delhi golf club was expected to host this but couldnt owing to a combination of factors
2214041 we gave the pgti a couple of dates but it did not suit them besides we had already committed to the ladies open the inaugural event of ladiess domestic tour from september 16 19 our elections are due after that
2214042 the dgc has shut down for re seeding of the winter grass
2214043 china has an ancient culture and this shows how the culture has developed
2214044 in alleyways near the ancient lama temple people watched televisions in hair salons and restaurants but outside the streets were mostly empty except for security volunteers
2214045 liu yidong 53 who works at a hotel said chinese are not as outgoing as westerners and did not need to celebrate outside
2214046 i dont have time to watch i have to make money
2214047 the beijing olympics is an opportunity not only for china but also for the whole world
2214048 the french support was of a political military diplomatic and logistic nature

2214050 we have all been preparing hard for this grand occasion
2214051 having four full practice sessions at the ditan university the boxers seemed well set for the saturday start the anxiety they had before stepping on the weighing machine had turned into ecstasy
2214052 although we were not too worried about the weights theres always that lurking fear
2214053 they have been practicing day in and day out and now with the draws out our initial anxiety has been overcome
2214054 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2214055 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2214056 and he exhorted the assembled athletes as role models for the worlds youth to
2214057 it ended sensationally when chinas first olympic superstar former triple gymnastics gold medalist li ning was hoisted by wires to the top of the stadium circled the circumference as though he were spacewalking and then touched the torch to a thin pipe setting off a spiral of flame to ignite the mammoth scroll shaped cauldron overlooking beijing
2214058 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2214059 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2214060 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2214061 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2214062 i want to reiterate on his behalf that the united states supports georgias territorial integrity we urge all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict

2214066 we want you to win as many golds as you possibly can go for it give it all you got
2214067 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2214068 weve had these back and forths with china for years
2214069 candor is most effective where nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
2214070 ive worked hard to build that respect and trust i appreciate the chinese leadership that have worked hard to build that respect and trust
2214071 it is a commitment to strengthen that foundation for years to come
2214072 the embassy ceremony took place with a heavy haze engulfing the chinese capital despite concerted government efforts to slash pollution before the games

2214086 in the womens event there are at least 20 shooters who have scores of perfect 400
2214087 so it all depends on how our shooters and the others shoot
2214088 we had done well at practice in hanover the shooters were training for 8 10 hours everyday their practice should bear fruit
2214089 i never thought i would be at the olympics but here i am and lets see what happens
2214090 i have been practising for 8 10 hours and am happy with my preparation
2214091 now i have to put behind my preparation and think about the competition
2214092 i have been here for the last 10 days and am comfortable with the hot and humid weather
2214093 i am not worried about the conditions though and you never know i might get my form back tomorrow
2214094 i think his form must have put some of the nations under pressure i knew there were quotas available but somehow i thought somebody was conspiring to keep him out

2214109 dont write short copy because everyone tells you its the only way to go instead try testing long copy vs short copy in a head to head test to find out what your audience responds to best
2214110 and be sure that the end of your message is as powerful as your lead in it turns out your best prospects are reading both
2214111 harris said that changes in its survey methodology could account for the dip but its overall finding was that growth in the percentage of adult internet users who looked for health information online had leveled off
2214112 respondents were largely credulous about the health information they found online 86 of online health searchers said the information they located on the internet was reliable

2214120 smoking marijuana is illegal and we dont promote things that are illegal on our television station
2214121 i dont know i watched it a few weeks ago and i dont remember anything specific
2214122 theres nothing in the show that advocates that anyone use marijuana
2214123 in fact there are specific statements addressing situations in which individuals shouldnt use marijuana and that young people should not use marijuana
2214124 everything in the program is about the impact that marijuana laws have on communities
2214125 tell us if you will have objections to the content before we incur the expense of filming the audience portion in their studio and we never heard and objection

2214130 were playing in the era of the next greatest player and winning a major in this era means a lot
2214131 the dominant player is pretty dominant to win a major now you make a huge step in your career a huge step its all about trying to pace yourself getting your game in shape for the big ones and then see if you can perform better under huge pressure
2214132 we played early yesterday and i almost wore out my 6 iron
2214133 you know it seemed like i was hitting 6 iron almost on every hole and thats not the way it was at the ryder cup obviously
2214134 obviously they made the holes tougher and now youre farther away from the green if you miss a fairway instead of hitting a 9 iron or 8 iron youre hitting a 6 iron and you know from this rough it becomes a lot tougher
2214135 this golf course is set up more like what a u s open was set up three or four years ago
2214136 missing the fairway by a couple of yards is the same as missing it by 10 there is no first cut second cut third cut its a more demanding punishing test

2214158 maybe im too much of an old school fan to appreciate this better nascar but i feel there has been a steady drop off of what made this sport great
2214159 drivers in their cars going 500 miles to prove who the better driver is what happened to that
2214160 we continue to build new inventory build new cars which are only better
2214161 and we do that throughout the season so i cant see any reason why next year would be a lot more money than it was this year to operate one of our cars
2214162 by demanding that so much be all alike nascar officials have diminished the quality of the racing
2214163 give all drivers the same range of equipment either make it affordable and available to all teams or restrict them from the big teams make it fair
2214164 this model focuses on the best possible outcomes for the community and has involved extensive consultation not just locally but also with governments at the state and federal level
2214165 pmta believes this is a local and current example of how the gap in infrastructure funding between the public and private education sectors has grown at considerable disadvantage to the public sector over recent years

2214202 does not strip workers of their right to choose a secret ballot election to decide whether to select or not to select a union representative
2214203 it is not until the union obtains signatures from 75 or more of the unit that the union has more than a 50 likelihood of winning the election
2214204 petitioning for a representation election requires a showing that 35 percent of the eligible employees have signed cards however the general policy of the airline division is to file for a representation election only after receiving a 65 percent card return from the eligible voters in a group
2214205 the signing of authorization cards is a very significant part of the campaign the cards confirm that a majority of the bargaining unit is committed to forming a union while not a hard and fast rule ideally we like to see between 70 and 80 percent of the crew sign see counter campaign while the employer will not see who signed the cards the employer will know how many cards were signed the more cards we have the stronger our messages
2214206 signed pledge cards typically are needed from at least 30 percent of the employees to trigger an nlrb sanctioned election maritas said the spfpas policy is to collect pledge cards from at least 70 percent of the workers before filing an election petition
2214207 have 70 75 percent of members sign cards if unable to reach this goal review plan
2214208 at the meeting the union organizers verbally indicated that they had withdrawn the petition because they had originally had the support of 70 of the staff but now felt that they did not represent a clear majority and would not feel comfortable with a union in the store which only represent ed slightly more than half of the workforce at the store
2214209 to obtain an election through the services of the nlrb at least 30 percent of the employees in the bargaining unit must sign authorization cards for a valid petition as a practical matter the gcc ibt prefers about 70 percent of the eligible voters to have signed cards
2214210 the rule of thumb in the seiu is that its unwise to file for an election when fewer than 70 percent of the workforce have signed interest cards
2214211 it is no surprise we win only 50 percent of nlrb elections even though we normally wait for card signatures from 70 percent of more of the work force before filing a petition
2214212 in modern practice union organizers usually collect card from 60 to 70 percent of the workers in the bargaining union before proceeding to the next step
2214213 if the union was able to establish workers support of the union by a showing of signed union authorization cards from at least 30 percent of workers it could petition the national labor relations board nlrb for an election however because employee support for unions typically wanes in the weeks leading up to an election unions generally sought to obtain 50 percent to 70 percent or more of the signed union authorization cards before seeking an election

2214216 politics has always evoked paranoia to create a sense of oneness among highly atomized individualistic societies current forms of political paranoia exemplify the stress ridden pathologies of the nation state a flimsy entity unable to bring a nation together without heightening the uses of paranoia yet those who are invested in this project are often paranoid themselves or simply mobilize paranoia instrumentally political actors who directly and deliberately mobilize paranoia demand particular vigilance with the loss of the place of sacredness in social life the search for transcendence reworks itself in a variety of projects including fundamentalism the quest for transcendence in the context of the presumed death of god now rests with the faithful when there was a true place for religion in social life religion protected the faithful now with the diminished place of religion the faithful protect religion in this climate we have become fanatically protective of religion this inversion partly explains why the need for paranoid structures has increased
2214217 the late henri tajfel of the university of bristol in england and john turner of the australian national university devised a theory to explain the psychology behind a range of prejudices and biases not just xenophobia their theory was based in part on the desire to think highly of oneself one way to lift your self esteem is to be part of a distinctive group like a winning team another is to play up the qualities of your own group and denigrate the attributes of others so that you feel your group is better
2214218 once the division is made the inferences and projections begin to occur for one we tend to think more highly of people in the in group than those in the out group a belief based only on group identity also a person tends to feel that others in the in group are similar to ones self in ways that although stereotypical may have little to do with the original criteria used to split the groups

2214224 i hadnt heard the boat had been sold and that news has really taken the sting out of me
2214225 using the boat is one of the tricks we have to prevent gatecrashers and it also helps minimise after parties

2214227 weve had a strong core group of directors for a while now its not as if im coming in cold

2214233 we think that is too long a period for the constituents of this electorate to be without representation in state parliament
2214234 its incumbent on mr iemma as premier to decide on a by election date as soon as possible

2214236 its a national party stronghold the last time we ran the seat i think the vote was 26 per cent
2214237 crude prices have fallen more than us25 per barrel in three weeks yet motorists on the north coast have seen practically no fall in local petrol prices
2214238 this is exactly why the petrol commissioner was appointed and families on the north coast are today looking to pat walker to pull the oil companies into line
2214239 if the petrol commissioner does not have the powers he needs to deliver fairer prices for north coast families and i suspect he does not then he should call the assistant treasurer today and demand stronger powers

2214249 the study shows how dopamine shapes the two main circuits of the brain that control how we choose to act and what happens in these disease states
2214250 dopamine released by drugs leads to abnormal strengthening of the cortical synapses driving the striatal go circuits while weakening synapses at opposing stop circuits as a result when events associated with drug taking where you took the drug what you were feeling occur there is an uncontrollable drive to go and seek drugs
2214251 all of our actions in a healthy brain are balanced by the urge to do something and the urge to stop
2214252 our work suggests that it is not just the strengthening of the brain circuits helping select actions that is critical to dopamines effects it is the weakening of the connections that enable us to stop as well
2214253 the study illuminates why parkinsons patients have trouble performing everyday tasks like reaching across a table to pick up a glass of water when they are thirsty
2214254 our study suggests that the inability to move in parkinsons disease is not a passive process like a car running out of gas
2214255 rather the car doesnt move because your foot is jammed down on the brake dopamine normally helps you adjust the pressure on the brake and gas pedals it helps you learn that when you see a red light at an intersection you brake and when the green light comes on you take your foot off the brake and depress the gas pedal to go parkinsons disease patients who have lost the neurons that release dopamine have their foot perpetually stuck on the brake

2214277 been good for me on a personal basis because strikers go on goals and if you have a good pre season you set yourself up for a good campaign
2214278 im a confidence player so scoring goals and especially against good sides like fenerbahce steaua bucharest and portsmouth is good for me
2214279 fenerbahce had roberto carlos playing at left back alex in central midfield and mateja kezman up front so its not as if it was their reserve side they had a strong side out and we did really well
2214280 im not one of those players who sits around and picks up a pay cheque every week
2214281 im not happy if i am not playing so i had to get out of reading to play football and further my own career
2214282 if i could have done it at reading i would have stayed but the chances were very limited so i had to leave and play regular first team football

2214302 weve always said that the olympics is one of the most powerful properties in all of television
2214303 while we are thrilled with this milestone we still expect to write more business as the games begin and great stories continue to evolve

2214310 as you know our wide receiver corps is down so josh morgan more than likely will be in there with arnaz battle
2214311 the thing thats nice is the quarterbacks go to him
2214312 that means they trust him to run the right route and catch the ball
2214313 i think i had to learn like 40 plays and go out there in two hours and run those plays that day
2214314 hes been able to pick up this offense which is impressive for a rookie
2214315 and he seems like he belongs you watch him in practice and hes not overwhelmed
2214316 ive got experience with both shaun and alex in game situations though we do not have that experience thus far with j t osullivan
2214317 but right now im pretty focused on going out there and playing well
2214318 i think the excitement and things like that would set in more if i stepped away and looked at it but right now in the midst of preparing to play well im going out there and thinking i have a job to do and im going to go out there and play as hard and as well as i can
2214319 the emotion that goes on its kind of like being in the press box as opposed to being on the field
2214320 you can feel and see the emotion that goes on in a game and you can see how guys respond to stressful situations you cant get that in the box and you dont get that on tv either
2214321 de duels tegen bate borisov zijn voorbij maar niet vergeten
2214322 het is niet door de supercup te winnen dat we die uitschakeling zullen uitwissen je kunt gewoon niet uitwissen wat onuitwisbaar is
2214323 hoelang deze uitschakeling in de hoofden van de spelers zal blijven hangen weet ik niet maar we voelen ons slecht we blijven achter met een gevoel dat we er veel te weinig hebben uitgehaald
2214324 er heerst ook een gevoel van schaamte met alle respect voor bate maar wij moeten ons tegen zo een ploeg altijd kwalificeren we hebben de uitschakeling alleen aan onszelf te wijten

2214373 its unfortunate that this happened but jason is resilient and hell receive the best treatment available
2214374 i was there along with coach cheeks and tony dileo when the injury occurred which was during a routine five on five drill at an nba approved camp held in las vegas there was no contact made with jason when he suffered the injury
2214375 at this point we will continue to explore all available options in order to add an additional big man to our roster
2214376 but hes a hard worker hes going to get this taken care of and be back to 100 percent
2214377 the fade route was one thing we ran quite a bit in new mexico and we had a good feel for it
2214378 donovan was working on all the routes not just the fade route he wanted us to get better its been proven in camp with guys making plays left and right
2214379 he does many things well and that fade route is one of them
2214380 he also does multiple other things for us that most fans dont see we have ample weapons to create mismatches hank does some things inside for us we have some matchup situations that we may very well be able to take advantage of
2214381 that has been one of my focuses in camp going up and attacking the ball the way i used to
2214382 i dont know why but i stopped attacking the ball
2214383 hanks one we do have its something we worked on during the off season together and also did it out here hes been very good with it its something we could have used last year but we didnt its not a staple in the west coast offense but its something you can add in
2214384 we always change if something is wrong were going to fix it
2214385 you can never spend enough time with your quarterback its not just going out there and throwing the ball up he has to get used to whether im a jumper or not a lot of guys are quick and run under it that takes time hes pulled me aside and weve worked on that
2214386 its like a golf shot its your approach shot you want to get it close to the hole do you need to get under it put a little draw on the ball put a little backup on it it depends on the defenders some will let you get on the outside some you can post up like basketball and keep behind you but the biggest thing is put it up and then it comes down to us his job is put it up there for us and let us go get it
2214387 i have a feeling when the time is right well throw it a couple times this year
2214388 i love you you love me were a happy family and a hug for you and a kiss from me to you wont you say you love me too
2214389 of course we didnt score and when you dont score youre not going to win
2214390 sure i want to play but im still a team player i want to go and win a super bowl thats a once in a lifetime opportunity im behind him and the team 100 percent
2214391 you kind of have that mentality of only watching but at the same time you have to be ready to play all the time
2214392 hopefully ill have a long career and plenty of opportunity to play im not real concerned with it right now i just try to stay focused on what my goals are and all my goals are still in view
2214393 the only worry for me is getting enough playing time to where you can transfer it over to the field
2214394 thats why the preseason is so important to me because thats my opportunity to get out there and play
2214395 i feel a lot better than at this time last season im very confident about tonight and the group im with looking to put some points on the board it was pretty rattling last year but at the same time once you get out there its just 22 guys playing football regardless of what the circumstances are i feel like i did pretty well but obviously i think i can do better things this year
2214396 thats what hes gonna do visit a doctor in arkansas yesterday again its a personal situation
2214397 i know shawn came out publicly and gave you guys a statement and thats what it is were working with him on it theres a personal side to things and youve got to take care of business and thats what hes doing right now its very important that he does that and gets that part of his life taken care of
2214398 hell be in there a little bit hell have an opportunity hell work in on certain plays with the ones theyre not plays that are designed for him but hell work in that group of players
2214399 right now im a defensive tackle ive got to go out there and ive got to play against the run and ive got to play against the pass and ive got to play special teams
2214400 thats what ive got to do every phase of the game thats what im ready to do i think everything needs work ive just got to go out there and do everything right now
2214401 jason was just going to the basket making a normal move and this was a freak thing
2214402 this is devastating for him because hes had such a great summer and his confidence has been sky high but hell come back
2214403 its unfortunate that this happened but jason is resilient and hell receive the best treatment available
2214404 at this point we will continue to explore all available options in order to add an additional big man to our roster
2214405 we are confident that we can ensure the safety of these games
2214406 through our strong intelligence agencies and close cooperation with foreign intelligence agencies we have already obtained information about some terrorist activities
2214407 what good are the olympics if they cannot be safe
2214408 every measure has been taken to stage safe and secure games
2214409 but the ioc is always insistent that the need to ensure security not hinder the festive spirit essential to the games success
2214410 but once you are here and see how beautiful everything is you are glad they are taking these measures it is an inconvenience yes but a necessary one
2214411 what i dont understand here why jr finds it necessary to interject herself into a by election which makes her political which implies that she is trying to hurt the liberals in this riding
2214412 well knb apparently there are real damages being done as is going around the blogosphere
2214413 there was no negotiation there was never any substantive talk of what they would take
2214414 all of that was speculation from the beginning i think it was clear it was a bad situation in green bay and they had to deal with it any way they could
2214415 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2214416 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2214417 im a little out of shape compared to the other guys
2214418 theres no ill feelings he has a positive reputation within this organization
2214419 the unflinching faith in lucky numbers can be found everywhere from gift money given on birthdays and red packets distributed every spring festival in sets of two for a stronger effect to the apartment floor and even street numbers where people live to the amount of thank you money paid by the groom to his fiancees bridesmaids on their wedding day
2214420 in modern days people more like eight because they want to get rich
2214421 we still think hes got enough bullets in that 36 year old arm to be able to help us
2214422 they have a good team and theyre in a pennant race it couldnt have turned out any better for me
2214423 we feel hes healthy this is a veteran guy hes had success in the playoffs hell rise to the challenge hes been through it having those kind of experienced guys is helpful
2214424 were still waiting on some diagnostics but were not optimistic were going to have him anytime soon
2214425 i think it would be kind of narcissistic if i displayed it in my house
2214426 its a huge relief for sure its nice to contribute i dont want to feel like dead weight on the team you know it gives you a little bit of self worth i guess
2214427 his knowledge of and experience with many of our young players will be invaluable
2214428 any time you lose a guy with that experience its hard to replace
2214429 but if it happens im extremely happy and excited for murray i think he deserves another chance to be a head coach in the nhl
2214430 a year ago going back down to the phantoms as head coach was a good opportunity for me to get experience and show i could be a head coach
2214431 now getting a chance to go back to the nhl especially with the flyers is a good opportunity for me too
2214432 it wasnt something that i was planning on when it happened this late in the summer when paul called it was an opportunity that presented itself that i couldnt let go by there are so many people in the organization that ive worked with coached and played with that there were too many signs pointing to it being a good thing
2214433 but hes a hard worker hes going to get this taken care of and be back to 100 percent
2214434 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
2214435 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
2214436 not only did we play the race card we dealt it from the bottom of the deck
2214437 dealing the race card from the bottom of the deck
2214438 i just couldnt stand being wholesome and plan and boring one second longer
2214439 i really want to play on the team but thinking about it would get in my way it almost would make me try too hard so i think if i just focus on what gets me to play well that will help me and if i do get on the team it will help me play well in the ryder cup
2214440 theres a lot of golf ahead of me im just excited to be playing well
2214441 ive been very inconsistent this year and i just decided to make a change
2214442 i got a little different information and i kind of worked on it and it just clicked
2214443 today i felt like i didnt hit the ball very good but i was able to get it around the golf course if that happened maybe a month ago i probably would have shot a few over par so im happy where my game is i think its only going to get better too
2214444 i think the tough thing is to basically know youre not able to play and youre watching guys youre competing with play every week and youre kind of throbbing at the mouth a little bit
2214445 i find it pretty easy to let this course intimidate you its one of those old school challenges that just kind of never lets up but its still golf if you hit it in the right spots you should be fine
2214446 wir k nnen zum mond fliegen aber keine vern nftige bierdose konstruieren
2214447 wenn man wirklich etwas neues auf den markt bringen will muss man die dose wiederverschlie bar machen
2214448 an 20000 bin ich nicht interessiert ich suche nach einem ernsthaften markt
2214449 aus konsumentenbefragungen wussten wir dass verschlie barkeit gew nscht wurde doch bei den anderen bis dahin angebotenen l sungen gab es meistens zwei unabh ngige verschluss systeme das erste musste der abf ller einsetzen und f r den wiederverschluss wurde dann eine andere technik benutzt
2214450 das ist eins der ersten beispiele wie nanotechnik ltere pr parate wieder aufleben lassen kann

2214452 die diagnoseverfahren werden immer besser aber danach k nnen wir den patienten nicht viel anbieten
2214453 a tax on the hiring of unskilled workers would discourage their employment offsetting some of the benefits they would get from the wage subsidy it would be better to finance the wage subsidy with a more general tax rather than with a tax targeted specifically on employers of unskilled workers
2214454 winning and losing always counts and one thing about me i never make excuses for losing but there will be a lot of bumps because there will be a lot of learning
2214455 the biggest challenge will be not letting the kids get down we wont talk about how we need to mesh quicker than most teams do because we wont talk or think about those things
2214456 well concentrate on how we have to get where we want to be and be in a position to be successful we wont talk about losing these kids know what well expect out of them
2214457 actually its an easy answer were starting something new here you come in after someone else youre cleaning up someone elses mess because the previous coach didnt do what he was supposed to do this is an ideal situation where there is no negative past our motto is no names no faces just focus on what were supposed to do if we focus on that well be ok
2214458 ive been wearing a brace getting a lot of physio therapy done and it gets better but you hit one of those shots out of the rough and its back to square one
2214459 you cant give it a hundred percent sometimes especially when it starts hurting and your focus goes on the pain instead of worrying about hey i need to make this putt maybe it helps that way ive been fortunate
2214460 he was supposed to win the gold because he had won the commonwealth games that year and the asian games
2214461 he thought he was going too fast i think it was a management error by him
2214462 im starting to feel very comfortable playing in the big events where before i had a bit of a problem
2214463 i tried too hard and sort of pushed it too much so i always made a lot of mistakes this year both the swing is better i definitely feel a lot calmer more and more sort of content with life in general i would say
2214464 the fairways are narrow and if you miss the fairways by a foot you are worse off than if you miss by 20 yards which you need to take different peoples opinions as to whether that is fair it is a difficult course anyway with the greens and the pin positions to protect it im not sure you need rough as long as it is and you certainly dont need to sweep it back toward the tee the night before the tournament i think the u s open at torrey pines was set up perfectly
2214465 i look forward to the opportunity to play in a game against somebody else here besides beating on ourselves
2214466 the steelers obviously are a good football team well coached with a lot of talent
2214467 it will be good to get in there and see what looks good and see what we need to continue to work on
2214468 i dont think youll see the best in either team from whats going to happen down the road
2214469 however there are a couple of things with this team that you get
2214470 thats not what our team does here so its a little bit twofold there
2214471 i mentioned yesterday that weve cut obviously the number of plays down from what we have installed in training camp here just so the guys can get out there and function in particular the young guys
2214472 they can get out there and function and theyre not worried about what the play is
2214473 i think hes done a good job with it but again well get to see him against different people here well see how he does
2214474 im going to have a lot of fun out there coming out and starting
2214475 im going to try and showcase my talent and let the coaches know im ready im going to show them what i got
2214476 i said this early in camp that there are going to be certain guys that make this football team because of special teams if everything is equal or close to and youre excelling on special teams then youre going to be the guy that makes this club
2214477 weve got to improve in that area from last year we think weve addressed it and now weve got to execute it
2214478 i normally dont get hit like that during the preseason till preseason games
2214479 it is what it is im not going to harp about it
2214480 smoggy as hell giving way to just plain smoggy and with luck there could be a shower heavy enough to scrub a few thousand tons of carbon based particulates from the air
2214481 it is great that ill get to share the dressing room with sachin tendulkar playing with him is a dream of every player i will try to learn from sachin
2214482 i will talk to players like sehwag who have played well against him
2214483 the under 19 world cup win gave me a lot of confidence after that i did not do well in the indian premier league for royal challengers but then i again came up with a good performance in the emerging players tournament in australia last month but frankly speaking i did not expect a call up so soon
2214484 give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free
2214485 ok all old white men with gray hair who havent yet taken buyouts please report to this side of the room
2214486 hes endured and hes still throwing the same stuff it shows that pitching isnt about throwing hard its about being smart
2214487 as far as i know im going to play in 2009
2214488 theres a lot of baseball left to be played this year and thats what i need to remain focused on i have to get through this year healthy but if i do that i have all intentions of playing next year
2214489 its usually one of the first things that goes through my mind
2214490 youre taking him away from the people who could help him thats not something were comfortable with right now
2214491 the team is doing great things i just want to stay out of the way believe it or not i can stay out of the way
2214492 i hope this is the last change well make for a long time
2214493 it wasnt that weird because id never done it before
2214494 hes like the pudgy guy who shows up at the company picnic everybody is laughing and then he walks away with all the trophies
2214495 its just real old and they havent kept it up ive heard stories about former mets manager art howe coming off a road trip and finding a rat a live rodent on his desk i remember us trying to catch a rat running around in the bullpen
2214496 this is a baseball game and these games are important because teams are trying to make the playoffs and everybody understands that
2214497 im very happy to get a chance to return to the nhl with the flyers
2214498 a year ago going back down to the phantoms to be head coach was a good opportunity for me to get experience and to show that i could be a head coach now getting a chance to go back to the nhl especially with the flyers is a good opportunity for me too
2214499 its great to get a goal not only personally but to get a win
2214500 now we have to go against holland then nigeria i couldnt be happier the guys couldnt be happier peter nowak the coach couldnt be happier
2214501 if somebody asked me a question i answered it but im focused on getting better im more worried about how im doing on the practice field than whats going on elsewhere
2214502 some people thought i shouldve been mad when they read that my coach was talking to green bay but i can only do what i can do thats all i try to worry about
2214503 he doesnt have any allusions about being the key to the vikings success this season
2214504 its all anybody talks about hes the weak link stuff like that you know that old dan reeves line never let em see you sweat thats what he does a great job of
2214505 it kind of gave me some perspective on tarvaris donovan was still a work in progress at that point as far as the throws he was making and wasnt making
2214506 playing quarterback is just an evolution name me somebody who was great right out of the gate dan marino went to the big game right away but peyton manning threw 28 interceptions his first year who was great in their second year not many
2214507 hes not a roller coaster rider he locked his jaw at the end of the season and said this is what i need to get better at and he set out to do that youre talking about a kid who was here in the beginning of march when he didnt have to be he came in on saturdays in the offseason to work with his position coach thats unheard of so he wants to be good thats half the battle
2214508 im able to go through my reads faster im able to recognize coverages faster and different matchups i just feel a lot better than i did last year
2214509 im still a young guy and im still going to make some young guy mistakes but i feel a lot more comfortable out there than i did a year ago last year i was just trying not to make mistakes this year im still trying to avoid mistakes but im also trying to make plays and be aggressive
2214510 weve got to be able to beat one on one coverage on the outside bernard berrian who was acquired in the offseason will help us with that sidney rice an 07 second rounder who caught 31 passes as a rookie will help us with that now that hes a year two guy i like what ive seen in camp from tight end visanthe shiancoe an 07 free agent signing last year he was somewhat lost system wise but i dont see the wheels grinding anymore so all of those things should help
2214511 the biggest difference i see in him is his confidence
2214512 hes much more comfortable at the position i saw it in the otas it just seemed like he knew where to go with the ball in the presnap as opposed to dropping back and kind of figuring it out then
2214513 how could a nation that gloried in his triumph treat him like a second class citizen
2214514 the question is as valid as the story is phony he did not throw his gold medal away but lost it and devised a powerful fable to cover his own carelessness
2214515 his rigid rules on amateurism were being ridiculed by journalists and tested by an increasing number of athletes who saw everyone making money from their efforts but themselves
2214516 it was razor blades to edit and i would write my own stuff to go along with it to get information on an athlete i would go to the encyclopedia britannica or that sort of thing
2214517 and this doesnt mean that you shouldnt have a saving account or a 401k or save for college
2214518 this is written to those who would heap up more than they need
2214519 this is written for those who would be miserly toward others
2214520 its beautiful beautiful im not talking about political things we are simply athletes
2214521 weve had a whole year to train well be up to the challenge
2214522 it turns both ways it can be an advantage but theres also more pressure your friends eyes are all on you you can feel it
2214523 it was a very difficult decision to leave my hometown but i felt like i was too young to stay in the gym and coach
2214524 i wanted to discover more outside of gymnastics the world was too big with too many opportunities

2214530 the first game in this kind of tournament is very tight and you have to compete
2214531 im very proud of them because the first game is never easy and you never know how it is going to be
2214532 i think thats the first goal i scored that hasnt hit the back of the net
2214533 it barely made it over the line but they all count the same
2214534 now we have to go against holland then nigeria i couldnt be happier the guys couldnt be happier peter nowak couldnt be happier
2214535 we created a lot of chances and we were dangerous in the final third

2214539 das ziel des systems ist es die fahrt in die innenstadt zu erleichtern und damit sogar zu beschleunigen doch aus den wirtschaftswissenschaften wissen wir dass die reduzierung des preises eines guts dazu f hrt dass es h ufiger nachgefragt wird
2214540 ich bin mir deshalb nicht sicher dass das system also zu weniger luftverschmutzung und weniger verkehr f hrt es k nnte auch das gegenteil bewirken

2214548 its better to be ahead than behind and looking up
2214549 we just have to have a better record than them after 162 games
2214550 it doesnt matter who youre playing if theyre in the way weve got to beat them if theyre not in the way weve got to beat the team thats in front of us and not worry about them the best record is going to get you to the playoffs regardless of who you beat
2214551 were really going to have to step it up a notch
2214552 they are in our division and because theyre the ones nipping at our heels as it goes on though we do play a lot of games against other teams and i think thats when weve really been able to go out there and win i think if you can get away with it its great
2214553 but when it really comes down to it in september were really going to have to win those games against the division rivals
2214554 its not like were not going up there and trying
2214555 its the end of my career and its not the way i planned it
2214556 itll be nice to have him here to console me maybe i can console him
2214557 you get to an age in your career where youre more likely to get hurt were not invincible
2214558 a girl is just under the limit now and 4 years later where is she
2214559 where would the sport be without nadia where would the sport be without olga
2214560 people are going to try and stop us any way they can
2214561 they have to play like that otherwise well kill them
2214562 elbows were raised i dont know if they were trying to make us injured for the olympic games
2214563 i dont know when australia and the u s have ever met and it has not been physical
2214564 i dont think we left the game feeling like it was any more physical than when we played russia or latvia
2214565 it got very physical but it certainly was not one sided
2214566 you want him to be 20 0 but theres nothing that we can do its definitely frustrating sometimes not being able to hit behind him but its part of the game its not like were going out there not trying to hit and not trying to score runs it just happens to be working out that way right now
2214567 going out there i think with whats occurred i tend to put a little more pressure on myself just knowing that every run i give up really does mean something
2214568 you just have to minimize the damage there have been times when i havent been able to and there have been times i have unfortunately i guess it hasnt showed much where it really counts in wins and losses
2214569 you just have to hit when it counts and thats when you have a runner on
2214570 thats where you have to improve dont get me wrong you have to hit to get on but you definitely have to be a much better hitter with runners on in order to be a good offensive team anaheim for example nobody is having career years but they get runners on and they just rake thats where they do their damage with runners on
2214571 were inconsistent but at the same time were still in first place
2214572 and to me were still two games ahead in the loss column and thats what counts what can we do about it we come out tomorrow and win tomorrows game
2214573 i show 2 much love for u to be a hater i am home everyday but im gettin my paper
2214574 there must be clearly a distinction between the fog and pollution
2214575 the fog you see is based on the basis of humidity and heat it does not mean this fog is the same as pollution there can be pollution but the fog is not necessarily pollution
2214576 they do not have the same confidence they once had can we return sport to its very essence to the fair play concept we must if we do not then part of the world as weve known it for all of our lives is going to leave us
2214577 the public will desert any sport in time if theyre not satisfied by its integrity
2214578 there is a level of sophistication and intelligence that is evolving all the time
2214579 i can see tally and shay zipping around in there getting whacked by tree branches and laughing it up
2214580 but were not optimistic that were going to have him any time soon
2214581 we feel he is healthy and liked the fact that he has experience and has had success in the past

2214593 on july 12 my niece and her mother were walking around the electronics store in lucky plaza to look for electronic gaming console
2214594 they chose a decent looking shop well furnished and displays of game consoles and games were neatly placed
2214595 the sales assistant had taken the psp away from the shop to a technician he claimed had downloaded software known to be able to download games and a psp version changer
2214596 he claimed that it is compulsory to install this license from sony and a software to play downloaded games
2214597 initially the total price was 3400 and they made a mistake writing 3550 on the gst 7 column which goes to show a very obvious mathematical error
2214598 after some negotiation the sales assistant gave a discount to 2600
2214599 my niece was very shocked at the price because she bought her playstation 3 at some 700 playstation 3 is a bigger console for use with the television
2214600 she wanted to cancel the order as she did not expect the price to be exorbitant but the sales assistant mentioned that once the software has been installed workman cost and product cost has been incurred and they will have to pay 2000 even if they do not want the console
2214601 given no choice she signed the credit card and paid 2600 in total

2214604 ugh that sux i understand the need for an entrance to the university but what about all of the numerous employers amp employees which made this section of the city as busy as it is today we all love simply turkey as it is one of the very few healthier options available for lunch around here for those of us who only get a half an hour for lunch i also heard that there may be a mcdonalds going in upstairs in strawberry square if that is the case that would be such a sellout by hdc i am not impressed
2214605 honestly i could never understand this sport ive been changing my moods about it from indifference to considering a snob game and now well now i dont consider it a sport at all
2214606 carmellas food was excellent and way more italian than the olive gardens i lived in italy i hope they keep the lasagna at least it is disheartening to see that an upscale restaurant with fresh ingredients and made to order entrees cannot succeed on second st guess well have to settle for cheese steaks and giant beer placards i wish a restaurant could succeed without using premade ingredients and without relying nearly entirely on alcohol sales
2214607 looks like it is going to be sam buccas pizza pub i dont get how this brings anything unique to the location other than not having to walk to palumbos or second st pizza after getting sloshed i agree with brian that second street could use a prime steak house on second st however if one is craving good steak bricco is the place to go to as they do get good dry aged cuts from olewines
2214608 just last year i was watching it on tv and thinking i wish i could be a part of that

2214613 ford indicated he would keep me thoroughly advised as to the activities of the commission
2214614 he stated this would have to be done on a confidential basis however he thought it should be done
2214615 i referred to this weeks issue of newsweek magazine which contains a rather clear analysis of the report
2214616 i told congressman ford that newsweek was owned by the washington post and that apparently some one was trying to curry favor i told him we of course did not get along very well with either the washington post or newsweek he said that he was in the same boat that he liked neither one of these publications

2214633 i was a little concerned when i was walking to the dugout to be honest with you i dont know how i got there
2214634 if they want to bring the charges lets go its the only way to get it resolved

2214637 theyve made a very strong circumstantial case an extremely strong circumstantial case
2214638 its such a key piece of their argument and its based on inference we dont know which other labs had the strains with the mutations
2214639 there is a classic defense mechanism to raise reasonable doubt by presenting the jury with viable options as to how the crime was perpetrated
2214640 this case would have been a very very difficult case to prove
2214641 thousands of prosecutors in thousands of courthouses across this country every day prove cases beyond a reasonable doubt using circumstantial evidence
2214642 eliminated every possibility until they were left with one which is a tedious but very thorough way to do an investigation
2214643 if those questions are not resolved there will always be a residue of doubt that the perpetrator will still be at large and that an innocent man may have been accused
2214644 its very important to tie up these lingering loose ends and address the gaps
2214645 im waiting for it to be shown that the quantity and the quality of the powders in the anthrax letters could have been produced in those suites
2214646 he wanted to live in the big country and maybe get famous now that i see all this hes really famous
2214647 there is a pending investigation to determine who this guy is
2214648 i recall him thinking hes better than the rest of us
2214649 i recall him telling stories about having servants growing up and like that
2214650 he just thought he was better than anybody else and he could do anything and there was no way to stop him
2214651 i saw crushing wounds but there were very few walking wounded
2214652 i feel so sorry because shes dead she was just a very good person
2214653 the church is like one big family here were very close we stick together
2214654 he can do it all from that position whether its running catching the football or blocking he is a true professional and leader on and off the field and its a great deal for both brian and the eagles organization id like to give credit to eagles president joe banner agent todd france and brian for working so diligently in getting this deal done we look forward to brian having a great 2008 season and beyond

2214664 the damage that size does to performance is the dirty little secret of the fund management business
2214665 true safety lies in a research driven search for opportunities
2214666 dont really enjoy the challenge of searching here and there far and wide for the values that have escaped the crowd

2214687 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
2214688 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact
2214689 rampant habitat loss exacerbated by hunting for food and to supply the wildlife trade in traditional chinese medicine and pets
2214690 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
2214691 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change

2214714 summer camp is a time for fun but the health safety and well being of our children is our priority
2214715 it is most important that all of us camp medical and non medical staff parents and the community be diligent in taking the necessary steps to prevent the introduction and spread of this viral infection
2214716 todays settlement sends a resounding message to the entire auction rate securities industry this type of deceptive behavior will not be tolerated and we will actively seek justice on behalf of investors in auction rate securities
2214717 our goal is simple to get investors back their money and thats exactly what this deal does
2214718 equity partners are securitized by first mortgages on the property paid interest at above market rates and receive their full equity loan in a balloon payment together with an agreed upon bonus at the sale of the renovated property
2214719 the indictment alleges a sophisticated scheme to defraud important taxpayer financed healthcare programs a scheme that ranged from street level operatives to the chief executive of a hospital
2214720 there is too much money being stripped from public healthcare programs and the potential impact to those with legitimate needs is too great to let those orchestrating such frauds escape prosecution
2214721 pay for patient schemes involve many players recruiters doctors ambulance and transport companies nursing facilities and hospitals
2214722 irs criminal investigation provides the financial expertise in following the money and exposing those individuals at every level who financially benefit from this type of fraud
2214723 im a sports fan i would not say im a terribly big baseball fan he said and he watched jamie moyer pitch to jorge cantu with the bases loaded
2214724 very few in my life under 10 more silence a painful whacking
2214725 i dont he replies before i can finish the question cantu lines out to shortstop jimmy rollins to end the inning the crowd goes wild paulie doesnt react we make about 5 1 2 seconds of small talk about his upcoming film greetings from the shore which is why he was at the ballpark to promote it finally i work up the nerve to ask one final question for a little levity i imagine a witty answer from sorvino prompting me to reciprocate with loud laughter which prompts paulie to give me a dead stare and reply youre amused im here to amuse you
2214726 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2214727 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2214728 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2214729 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2214730 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2214731 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2214732 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2214733 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal
2214734 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against martin luther king with the 50 states
2214735 see richard doesnt really mean what he says its popular for him to say it thats the way he makes a living
2214736 same as jesse jackson some more of our black revolutionaries who make a living off of keeping things emotional
2214737 i dont think the majority of white people are thinking that way anymore
2214738 im concerned that once he gets in office that he wont be recognized as an american president
2214739 how will you stand out in the crowd and get the scoop no one else can
2214740 i get a 50 50 chance to see the next president since im covering the republican convention ill get to see president bush and i get a real chance to start my career
2214741 seeing the work ethic that goes on behind this job
2214742 i think we get to sit in the nbc box so seeing all those people there ill be learning from the best
2214743 one of the great things about being in a democracy is you cant have too many perspectives
2214744 citizen journalists can bring the psychology of the individual voters mind set into their reports not just the collective opinions of groups
2214745 yeah ill have the full package including the full clean up of the inside plus id like to lower my wheels if you know what i mean
2214746 sure full package cleanup of inside and lowering basically everything we may offer
2214747 yeah im trying to sell it for a pretty nice price so it must look flawed no problem
2214748 i think there is a world market for maybe five computers
2214749 i have traveled the length and breadth of this country and talked with the best people and i can assure you that data processing is a fad that wont last out the year
2214750 so we went to atari and said hey weve got this amazing thing even built with some of your parts and what do you think about funding us or we ll give it to you we just want to do it pay our salary well come work for you and they said no so then we went to hewlett packard and they said hey we dont need you you havent got through college yet
2214751 the driver is a patient of ours and is unwell he was parking
2214752 i think he was coming in he was running into a disabled space and has gone forward over the pavement
2214753 those who were working the building heard the bang the doctor working in the room next door felt the bang
2214754 obviously the driver was very shaken he is okay the car was not that badly damaged either
2214755 its every practice managers nightmare from the clinical governance point of view its very worrying
2214756 they the gps dont have any past medical histories to refer to
2214757 some doctors will know the patients well enough anyway the patients do go to see the same doctor
2214758 antiguans and barbudans are a caring and loving people and together we can and will stop the violence
2214759 we note that the macbook has had the same design since its launch over two years ago and the macbook pro has had essentially the same design since its launch over 2 5 years ago which was very similar in design to the powerbook g4 released over 5 5 years ago
2214760 to compare the long running imac g5 design lasted three years
2214761 i hope this will put the public eye and public pressure back on the case for a public inquiry
2214762 i think watching the performance anyone who left and didnt believe we should have a public inquiry would have been very few and far between
2214763 i think the play was portrayed so well that it really got us angry again it really gave me the wind under my wings to get going again because as was also portrayed in the play you do get tired you do think where else have we got to turn
2214764 i think its not over until its over and its not over yet
2214765 its something we need as it brings it back to the forefront again that the families are still here that they are still trying to fight for justice
2214766 if the show only moves us a millimetre towards a public inquiry then it is a success there isnt any other goal
2214767 it is like the condensation of 13 years of your life revealed to you in one and a half hours and even though you know the story its the intensity of that you even then start thinking this is bad and then you remember its about you its weird
2214768 this was a truly tragic case where two young animals suffered immensely for a long period of time yet the suffering was entirely preventable
2214769 i would urge anyone in a similar situation struggling to cope with an animal to seek help before things get completely out of hand as they did in this case
2214770 no one should ever be embarrassed about asking for help it is the right thing to do
2214771 there are numerous animal welfare charities that are on hand to give advice and support sitting back and allowing animals to suffer is simply not an option
2214772 similarly i would urge anyone who has suspicions of animals suffering silently in their area to please contact the rspca

2214777 in kaum einem bundesland bietet das wahlsystem dem b rger so viele m glichkeiten

2214782 it is important staff are happy with their workplace and an upgrade of facilities can have a positive impact on the overall functioning of the school
2214783 the new administration block will be much bigger and will provide staff with the facilities they need to continue their smooth and efficient running of the school
2214784 when we were married we made a commitment for life these days it is too easy to get out
2214785 because we dont have much family here they have become family
2214786 according to court records rep russell pearce strangled his wife
2214787 russell pearce is possessed of a violent temper and has from time to time hit and shoved the wife the last time being on february 3rd when he grabbed the wife by the throat and threw her down
2214788 to repeal the law which prevents them from hiring individuals who are in this country illegally
2214789 the republican party in this state has to decide if we want to be the republican party of john mccain and jon kyl or if we want to be the republican party of russell pearce
2214790 and the difference is that the russell pearce republican party is at its core xenophobic racist and exclusionary it is the john birch wing of the republican party i dont think that is the way for the republican party to remain in the majority in this state
2214791 unfortunately there is not a pleasant way to tell the voters who russell pearce really is
2214792 i dont think its productive it certainly has a negative effect on the voters
2214793 russell pearce is a dangerous harmful spokesman for the republican party
2214794 i think he and his ilk are directly responsible for the deteriorating image of the party and i think they are largely responsible for why we are losing statewide elections and why we used to have six congressman and now have four i think it all lands on their shoulders
2214795 i think nathan went over the edge with this latest attack you dont stoop to their level to try to defeat them
2214796 he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2214797 if he wanted to kill senator obama he simply would shoot him with a sniper rifle but then he claimed that he was just joking
2214798 all you have to do is blog about the contest with the proper links subscribe to email feeds and comment about your entry post on the official contest page note a trackback is considered a comment
2214799 hopefully london will hold the promise of a return to the true olympic spirit
2214800 there was a rumour flying around this afternoon wednesday 6 august on a local radio station and ongoing claiming that two men were arrested today for the double murder of the mullanys after their girlfriends turned them in
2214801 for the record this is absolutely false no one is arrested or in custody for these murders or any other murder
2214802 somali young people face particular problems in terms of their education and a lack of parental understanding to support their childrens education
2214803 somalis are acutely aware of the problems they face and feel strongly that more needs to be done to develop young somali people into adulthood
2214804 cwvys is delighted to work in partnership with sis to enable the views of somali young people to be heard to support their aspirations being realised and their positive contribution to the future of wales
2214805 i have reached the exceptional conclusion that immediate custody in your case is not the answer either from the publics point of view or the victims familys point of view or for any other purpose
2214806 it is clear that you were in the extremely bad company of fitzgerald and it would appear you were in the wrong place at the wrong time and it has to be said with the wrong person in the form of fitzgerald
2214807 i think it would not be right to impose a custodial sentence in this case and i fully realise this is an exceptional course to take
2214808 you was the one who killed him you can take all the blame for it or the same will happen to you and your mother when i get out
2214809 the court would urge you to take full advantage of this opportunity
2214810 even though a sense of adventure is a part of growing up parents should stress to their children that jumping on moving vehicles is unacceptable dangerous and potentially fatal
2214811 otherwise i would have had to go over the new bridge
2214812 jordan was a victim of that cocktail found in many of his age a thirst for adventure coupled with a complete lack of appreciation for danger and no thought of the risks or potential consequences of his escapade
2214813 we have heard of similar incidents to this case be it children car surfing train surfing bus surfing i have also heard of a case where children tied a skateboard to the back of a car its not a craze but we do hear of it happening from time to time
2214814 we want children to enjoy the summer holidays and in some respects it is good for them to have the occasional scrape
2214815 i was taking the staff out for a treat there were seven of us we went for a meal and couple of drinks
2214816 we went to oceana and i have worked there myself six years ago as a doorman when it was ritzy
2214817 they just said we were not allowed in with visible tattoos we just went somewhere else i know not to kick up a fuss
2214818 there were ladies with us as well we didnt look like troublemakers
2214819 i kind of felt degraded i had my armani suit on and it was a hot night so i took my jacket off and a short sleeve shirt
2214820 i have got a full sleeve and there is nothing offensive on it its tasteful
2214821 for someone to turn around and say im not good enough its discriminatory are they going to turn someone away for being fat or having religious clothing
2214822 its unbelievable i have been in many times and my tattoos have been visible i have eaten there in the day its just not consistent
2214823 i think about 60 of the premier league players have half or full sleeves tattoos would they turn away david beckham or angelina jolie
2214824 within seven days the facebook page had got 2 500 members
2214825 we do not operate a specific rigid policy concerning customers with tattoos or any form of body art
2214826 any decision to refuse entry to a customer is reached on an individual basis and considers a variety of factors such as age sobriety and appearance
2214827 r1os derrota a vilas y ahora qui n es el mejor de latinoam rica
2214828 there is virtually no part of the prosecution case that has been left undamaged and there is compelling evidence to show that the appellant played no part in the robbery
2214829 only witness to the robbery who was able to give any description of any of the men
2214830 we do so recognising the tenacity with which this appellant has fought to overturn this conviction
2214831 it may be suggested in some way that this itself should cause us to doubt the safety of the conviction
2214832 our job is to train and advise the afghan national army in all aspects of fob building
2214833 our job is to train the leaders and ncos so that they understand how to build and defend forward operating bases themselves
2214834 the etts were the only u s presence on our makeshift compound
2214835 generally classes in the morning are taught by the ett and classes in the afternoon are taught by the ana
2214836 we typically meet with the kandak commander after formation to discuss any issues or problems throughout the day the trainers are meeting and working with their companies
2214837 this fob will help bring stability to the entire region weve merely shown them the way they are the ones doing the work
2214838 every mission that we go on is augmented by the ana
2214839 this allows the citizens of afghanistan to see members of their army working professionally with coalition forces it contributes to a sense of overwhelming pride in their government and they see their army progressing and succeeding in stamping out the taliban
2214840 many of the soldiers in 4th kandak learn combat skills fast
2214841 training them and letting them handle explosives and teaching them to respect it will help strengthen their ability and national perception
2214842 we are getting the ana to a point where they can be self sufficient
2214843 we pass all our experience and knowledge on to them they do for themselves and it is working
2214844 it left us with financial problems and we had to let all our staff go except us and one other
2214845 we took out a huge loan and now just have the building i just feel so sad about it
2214846 sadly the chain has been broken now for the cherry tree there are only nine left and im devastated
2214847 it all seems so silly you see signs all over the place twinning towns with obscure places but you cant have a sign saying theres a nice pub down the lane
2214848 its more than just a pub its quite unique it was a post office and you could buy your groceries there it was very special to a lot of people
2214849 mr and mrs pocock chose to ignore our advice and consequently planning consent was refused
2214850 they were asked to remove their sign which again they refused to do
2214851 we had no choice but to take them to court to get our planning regulations enforced the court found in our favour which is proof that we acted correctly
2214852 alleine durch die spritkosten haben wir gut ein drittel an mehrkosten

2214855 but everyone loves asian chicks wearing a bikini and a cowboy hat carrying a sword and slicing up zombies
2214856 but everyone loves asian chicks wearing a bikini and a cowb
2214857 but everyone loves asian chicks wearing a bikini and a cowb
2214858 but everyone loves asian chicks wearing a bikini and a cowb
2214859 it is truly unfortunate that the csiro and the bureau of meteorology did not undertake a prior evaluation of the models used in the first study of its kind in australia in order to ensure that those models were able to reproduce the past situations that were relevant to the study
2214860 the reports findings were accepted without question by the government and by most commentators
2214861 however dr david stockwell author of niche modeling and host of the niche modeling website
2214862 for one reason and one reason only it told them exactly what they wanted to hear
2214863 a major concern however was the refusal of that organisation to publish the backup data
2214864 maybe there is a case for the psychologists to become involved
2214865 this change wont impact the game were really pleased with the look and feel that brian helped create for diablo iii and the new person we bring on board will work with the other artists on the team to maintain the art style moving forward
2214866 tries to come to terms with a humane solution to a political problem or a political solution to a human problem
2214867 the scheme outlined by the minister is far from perfect
2214868 the national assembly for wales has at its core a commitment to transparent and accessible democracy
2214869 i am proud to chair a panel that will report to the assembly commission on the best way of providing support to assembly members that is appropriate for wales and that will help underpin future good governance and effective public service in wales
2214870 from our point of view taxpayers are under a lot of pressure at the moment given the record tax take and the current economic conditions
2214871 people are very concerned that our elected representatives are in some cases squandering our money and at the very worse helping themselves to money theyre not entitled to
2214872 the best way to restore the publics faith and dispel those concerns is to make the system 100 transparent by publishing all expenses claims and receipts for everyone to see
2214873 the independent review panel has therefore been tasked to produce a set of evidence based recommendations containing principles that will deliver a fair equitable and transparent process for the financial support of assembly members in order to improve public knowledge and perception of these issues

2214900 we have entered a phase where the progress in security is building upon itself and is allowing for iraqi government institutions economic development and civil society to mature at a quicker pace
2214901 operating side by side and coordinating intelligence iraqi and coalition forces are increasingly denying terrorists the ability to operate or hide in iraq
2214902 our partnership is strong and we remain committed to helping iraqis rebuild their nation
2214903 while the security situation is steadily improving we continue to pursue those who oppose a united and flourishing iraq so we can continue to build on our gains and not surrender them
2214904 unclean water and dysentery are the biggest issues in zabul
2214905 this project will help children under 5 years old who suffer from malnutrition and diarrhea
2214906 this process will destroy the germs in the water making it safe to drink so your children wont get sick
2214907 i ask you respectfully as the leaders and educated men of this district to encourage your families and others to continue to use purified water if you do this you wont get sick from the water but more importantly the children will not get diarrhea and will get the nutrition they need to grow big and strong
2214908 this treatment the doctor has given to you is important
2214909 our children get infected from drinking water and eating foods i hope you use this gift from the prt the right way
2214910 no ive just never come across anyone whos taken that sort of initiative before
2214911 the overall objective is to develop an iraqi led enduring quality health care system within wasit province
2214912 with improved training facilities medical equipment and supplies iraqi health professionals will be able to take the lead in caring for the iraqi people
2214913 this will allow coalition forces medical assets to take advisory and support roles
2214914 its a good experience for young medics and doctors to get out and see the people of iraq and work with them to help rebuild the country
2214915 we never got a rest or lunch break and didnt even notice we did a lot but there are so many more things we wish we could have done but couldnt
2214916 the afghan army now interacts with the taliban and other enemies of afghanistan and theyre doing extremely well against them
2214917 were seeing and experiencing more situations whereby the afghans have taken the lead
2214918 theyre not completely independent but were getting closer every day
2214919 we went over to them and asked them about what was going on
2214920 we all know ncos are the backbone of any army
2214921 as we increase their capabilities you have to have the right noncommissioned officers leading those squads and platoons
2214922 weve worked very hard in our mission to bring up the capacity and the capability of the afghan army and the police
2214923 and weve done it with a lot of american blood
2214924 its absolutely absolutely a difficult fight theres no doubt about it
2214925 nothing that we do over here is easy but we do have momentum and i feel very optimistic about things in the future
2214926 the equipment will give the ana another significant improvement in their tactical capability and their ability to take the fight to the insurgency
2214927 through the efforts of very many brave men and women tough men and women soldiers sailors airmen and marines were completing the mission
2214928 and were setting the stages for the future operations and for the future of the afghan army and the police in bringing stability to this country

2214934 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2214935 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2214936 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2214937 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2214938 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2214939 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2214940 i especially got into their promotion of teaching women about safe sex and about not being afraid to carry condoms
2214941 one of the things i tell them is most men are just going to be really happy to be there in the first place so dont be afraid to insist on safe sex every time
2214942 i had such a good time and the directors made me feel so comfortable
2214943 it was nerve racking but i did it and i want to do more acting i do want to be taken seriously as an actress
2214944 celebrity endorsements of politicians really dont mean much having campaigned for al gore and for john kerry i think that the only job that an entertainer may have is to attract media or attract people to a speaking engagement for said politician
2214945 i dont think celebrities impact people and nor should they
2214946 i have my political views but i dont think its important to share
2214947 there can be no patriotism without permanent opposition and criticism
2214948 i never think in my career wow i cant wait until this game is over
2214949 then i couldnt wait until that series was over i thought about it that weekend it was pretty awful

2214965 the current wholesale price is 141 cents a litre which is flowing in and has been passed on to consumers
2214966 the other good news is diesel has also dropped 20 cents a litre wholesale price
2214967 in ballarat when it is discounted is it discounted quite well
2214968 there is a possibility it could fluctuate but it looks like things are a bit stable this week
2214969 the prices are still very expensive but it provides people with a bit of relief
2214970 they made stuff up about the tribes and the ad by the way i think is racist
2214971 i think this whole thing is racist and im totally offended by it
2214972 she gave the tribes a windfall of about 140 million and they gave her 250 thousand not a bad return for the money huh
2214973 there is an acute shortage of accommodation across victoria and ballarat is no exception for people with disabilities
2214974 our main priority of strategic plan is to target development of alternative accommodation options
2214975 weve talked about it weve planned it and just to see something happening on the ground is very encouraging
2214976 were hoping for funding in the next state budget for the second half of the building which would be 2 5 to 3 million for the technology wing
2214977 that will finish it and we would finish up with an oval shaped building with student activity centres in the middle
2214978 there is a lot of juggling because every few months we have to change the way students can travel around the buildings and redo the out of bounds areas redo the pathways
2214979 weve got classes working in the rec centre and weve got classes working in the hall so there is a lot of additional stress and strain on people
2214980 but now that weve got this part of the building open and everyone can see how the whole thing will work they are feeling really positive
2214981 but the school has done well to work around it and the new building is looking fantastic
2214982 and they are getting the work done pretty quickly which is pretty good
2214983 after advocating for this to happen its really good to see it now
2214984 they are exploring what their policy is going to be in the near future
2214985 all unions and the labour council in ballarat are still committed to the state government conducting a plebiscite to ascertain the wishes of the community
2214986 the issue of price increases puts growers under extra financial pressure
2214987 i cant see mccain rushing to pay extra money to cover the cost of water
2214988 were only talking to customers about the possibility of it
2214989 most of the community across northern victoria has been saying very strongly we need to assess better water usage efficiently to get the best value
2214990 in some of these systems theyre paying 6 ml that is a very low cost of megalitres and we need to bear that in mind

2214994 president kennedy said we would put a man on the moon in 10 years and through american ingenuity and hard work we accomplished that goal
2214995 we need to lay down a similar gauntlet now and commit to a 10 year action plan to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and develop renewable energy sources
2214996 we need solution now a 10 year national program energy of independence with the same moral imperative and commitment we gave jfks moonshot program harrision said
2214997 i will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase i will not do it
2214998 whoever wins will face a big wake up call as soon as the election is over
2214999 there is no question that the proposals of either candidate would dramatically worsen the fiscal situation
2215000 the democrats have had a super majority on every local government body for the last 40 years
2215001 he nader polled very well here i believe around four percent
2215002 the idea that having more people involved destroys the system ruins for voters and who they want
2215003 not surprisingly there is fear on the part of the maine democratic party that any progressive candidate will take away votes from allen
2215004 the maine green independent party calls on the maine democratic party to cease their attacks on the ballot access of third party and independent candidates such attacks clearly show the extent to which this party is threatened by these candidates
2215005 were trying to create room for more voices to be heard that arent underneath two separate blankets
2215006 the spoiler thing is a backlash from parties who somehow think theyre entitled to the ballot box
2215007 greens are not necessarily democratic voters who have lost their way
2215008 we think this will help end the myth about maine being the highest taxed state in the country we didnt think it was true
2215009 the enemy recognizes that the ied is a strategic weapon
2215010 will come to the homeland and i dont want them in the homeland
2215011 pedimos a rusia que cese los ataques a reos y con misiles contra georgia respete la integridad territorial de georgia y retire sus fuerzas de combate terrestres del territorio georgiano
2215012 well why dont we do a hybrid of both candidates ideas
2215013 that was my bedroom window now that is all that is left everything is gone
2215014 we were in the flat when we heard a fire alarm but we didnt take much notice at first
2215015 it was the middle of winter and freezing and i didnt even have a coat
2215016 i had everything inside and i started to panic my clothes were replaceable but not my pictures
2215017 i was running round screaming my house my house but there was nothing i could do
2215018 all i had left was the skirt and shirt i was wearing i just felt numb
2215019 in sderot you live in constant fear of losing everything if a bomb falls on your house then you go away from that and you come here and then this happens its ironic
2215020 youre in a state of shock you dont know how youre going to get things then people around you start to give on the night it happened someone i didnt know a japanese guy gave me his coat
2215021 later people i didnt know offered me clothes make up places to stay and even money i got a lot of anonymous donations
2215022 i cant get over losing my pictures especially those of my father they were like my foundations

2215032 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
2215033 i dont go looking for them they come to me i will consider the fact that god has asked me to do it and i will just marry them
2215034 to my understanding the koran does not place a limit and it is up to what your own power your own endowment and ability allows
2215035 god did not say what the punishment should be for a man who has more than four wives but he was specific about the punishment for fornication and adultery
2215036 as soon as i met him the headache was gone
2215037 god told me it was time to be his wife praise be to god i am his wife now
2215038 i said i couldnt marry an older man but he said it was directly an order from god
2215039 i am now the happiest woman on earth when you marry a man with 86 wives you know he knows how to look after them
2215040 as you sit here if you have any illness i can see it and just remove it
2215041 they were sick and we told god and god said their time has come
2215042 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing
2215043 tonight that dream comes true may these olympic games bring you joy hope and pride
2215044 we cannot march as it goes on until very late
2215045 it would be like going out for a big night out two days before racing
2215046 i am very excited i think the opening ceremony will be fantastic because the chinese government really cares about it
2215047 i cant find the way in but im very happy
2215048 i said to him you albanians want to join the eu and from what i know the english and the americans respect private property very much i dont want yours i just want my own back and nobody can deny me that
2215049 i have never lived in a village i know nothing about agriculture i am ill
2215050 if we agreed to be relocated to a village enclave somewhere we know that we like the other idps internally displaced persons would never get our home back
2215051 we know that we are like a thorn in the side for the greek camp because as long as we are here we are a problem they have to resolve

2215059 this is an enormous waste of law enforcement resources that should be focused on violent and serious crime
2215060 with alcohol we acknowledge the distinction between use and abuse and we focus our law enforcement on efforts to stop irresponsible use we do not arrest or jail responsible drinkers that should be our policy for marijuana as well
2215061 an addictive drug which induces in its users insanity criminality and death
2215062 the perception that marijuana is about fun and freedom it isnt its about dependency disease and dysfunction
2215063 not soon but eventually youll see the development of a marijuana futures market
2215064 before the decade is out to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth
2215065 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2215066 it would be impossible to solely credit the surge for the turn around
2215067 but if we had a comprehensive energy plan to move us to the next generation and it included some drilling i could go along with that but dont confuse it drilling is not a solution
2215068 she doesnt want to do it because she doesnt want those conservative democrats to vote with us and say yeah we have to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
2215069 one immediate solution is to make oil companies use the permits they already have
2215070 four years ago john kerry lost duval county by a wide margin as did al gore before him
2215071 i think it says a lot about his support here and obamas chances of winning not only northeast florida but the whole sunshine state
2215072 im going to do this job more effeciently than its been done
2215073 and im going to be the same tough fearless prosecutor ive always been
2215074 forget the political rhetoric and the stuff the media likes to cover
2215075 i want to talk about one of my young lawyers and a young police officer working together on an investigation working on getting search warrants and getting ready for a trial
2215076 its going to be hard fought and mccain has got such a natural appeal i think to some constituencies veterans which are a big portion of the population here some of the retired people
2215077 there are a lot of republicans in new mexico who are not as excited about their senate candidate as the democrats are about theirs which is true of national polls in the presidential race in which obama supporters are a lot more fired up than mccain supporters are
2215078 in every life there is one particular event that is decisive for the entire person for his fate his convictions his passions
2215079 where had all that russian generosity gone it had been replaced by political consciousness
2215080 for not having seen it all nor remembered it all for not having divined all of it
2215081 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2215082 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country

2215084 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2215085 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2215086 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2215087 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2215088 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2215089 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2215090 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2215091 just so you all know we did set a record
2215092 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2215093 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2215094 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2215095 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2215096 many of those offshore leases are deepwater potentially lucrative but expensive the shallower the lease the less costly the exploration there is another factor at work as well part of an oil companys worth is the reserves of oil it owns or leases so amassing lots of leases boosts its stock value it is always good to lease more
2215097 we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2215098 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030 leasing would begin no sooner than 2012 and production would not be expected to start before 2017
2215099 because oil prices are determined on the international market however any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant
2215100 we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2215101 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030 leasing would begin no sooner than 2012 and production would not be expected to start before 2017
2215102 because oil prices are determined on the international market however any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant
2215103 remember that natural gas pipeline the oil companies magically never seem to build to the north slope
2215104 and production would not be expected to start before 2017
2215105 saying that production wouldnt begin for 10 years democrats oppose offshore drilling just like they did 10 years ago
2215106 why the democrats cant make the oil companies the bad guys on this issue is beyond me
2215107 its a delicate balance and that balance is being skewed by the 24 7 world of internet and cable news faster faster is the mantra but we need to try our damndest to fact check on demand
2215108 for climate changes he glosses over that this local planetary system is in constant change and we cant accurately measure the recent relatively small changes and anthropogenic contributions are an open question

2215110 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
2215111 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary

2215113 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
2215114 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
2215115 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
2215116 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
2215117 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
2215118 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
2215119 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
2215120 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
2215121 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism

2215126 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2215127 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2215128 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2215129 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2215130 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2215131 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2215132 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2215133 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2215134 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2215135 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone

2215137 breaking our oil addiction will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
2215138 we can see shuttered factories open their doors to manufacturers that sell wind turbines and solar panels that will power our homes and our businesses
2215139 we can watch as millions of new jobs with good pay and good benefits are created

2215156 hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2215157 he always wanted to be a police officer to help people he wanted to help people who were victims of abuse

2215161 im not surprised at the figures ive lost a lot of good friends through drugs
2215162 it was a complete waste it was a way of life when i was growing up all my peers were taking drugs and if it hadnt been for the foundation i would be dead
2215163 from an enforcement point of view police do a very good job of locking up individuals but there is such a widespread market the gap is quickly filled again due to the demand and availability of drugs on the streets which we are trying to reduce
2215164 drugs are more available now and they are cheaper than they used to be
2215165 theyre also a lot stronger theres not so many people cutting it and diluting the drugs theres a lot of strong stuff out there

2215182 social networks really dont care if you get pawned or not
2215183 people know if they go on a computer and download a program they could get a virus they dont have the same view of how dangerous that can be on a social networking site
2215184 once the content is moved from their site they have no control over that
2215185 we also handle sdi digital signals coming from the mnet studios these need to be compressed all the digital signals are multiplexed before being sent via fibre links to the uplink facility where they are up converted to ku band amplified and uplinked
2215186 we can counter rain fade up to a point by increasing the uplink power an automatic control system monitors the signals at the satellite receive point and during periods of heavy rain will automatically increase the uplink power up to a point if the rain density increases during a storm signal fading may be beyond the automatic gain control threshold and signals will break up
2215187 customers often dont understand why when the sun shines in cape town they experience rain fade it is most likely due to heavy rain at the uplink site in johannesburg sometimes i wish we could control the physics of radio propagation ku band is a practical choice of frequency because of the convenient size of the dishes while we use a 9 m dish to uplink to the satellite customers only require a 60 90 cm dish to receive signals
2215188 mobile tv is another technology that we are engaged in it is a form of digital terrestrial television using uhf frequencies m net has a mobile tv trial licence the trial runs in the johannesburg pretoria and cape town areas from some 14 transmitters we use the dbv h standard that is designated for handheld applications

2215190 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
2215191 an appearance at the convention by edwards would only highlight the unresolved story
2215192 national enquirer scoop or not there appears to be way too much smoke here for the major mainstream media to continue ignoring the story about the out of wedlock child that john edwards may have fathered
2215193 but the story resurfaced in late july after the enquirer staked out a beverly hills hotel and reported edwards had met with his alleged mistress
2215194 for the most part mainstream media outlets have not pursued the matter in part because edwards no longer is a presidential candidate nor does he hold a public office
2215195 but the story resurfaced in late july after the enquirer staked out a beverly hills hotel and reported edwards had met with his alleged mistress
2215196 mr edwards is it true you were at the beverly hilton visting rielle hunter and your child on the night of july
2215197 would do everything in his power to make sure john edwards did not endorse hillary clinton
2215198 in an interview for broadcast tonight on nightline edwards told abc news correspondent bob woodruff he did have an affair with 44 year old rielle hunter but said that he did not love her
2215199 oh my god the pristine la times has sullied its hallowed self with mention of gasp the possible pause look over each shoulder affair of the now private citizen never mind he could have been vp or atty genl john r edwards quick quick my smelling salts

2215205 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both

2215211 deep sea temperatures warmed about 1 300 years before the tropical surface ocean and well before the rise in atmospheric co2
2215212 suggests the rise in greenhouse gas was likely a result of warming

2215224 in the midst of a global change that can modify temperatures by as much as 10 degrees fahrenheit
2215225 global warming has finally been explained the earth is getting hotter because the sun is burning more brightly than at any time during the past 1 000 years according to new research
2215226 suggests that increasing radiation from the sun is responsible for recent global climate changes
2215227 is brighter than it was a few hundred years ago and this brightening started relatively recently in the last 100 to 150 years
2215228 simultaneous warming on earth and mars suggests that our planets recent climate changes have a natural and not a human induced cause
2215229 habibullo abdussamatov head of space research at st petersburgs pulkovo astronomical observatory in russia says the mars data is evidence that the current global warming on earth is being caused by changes in the sun
2215230 changes in the suns heat output can account for almost all the climate changes we see on both planets
2215231 similar to the warming experienced on earth over approximately the same period
2215232 suggests rapid changes in planetary climates could be natural phenomena
2215233 some planetary climate changes may be due to variations in the solar system environment
2215234 a study of sea temperature changes predicts a lull as traditional climate cycles cancel out the heating effect of greenhouse gases from pollution
2215235 global warming will be put on hold over the next decade because of natural climate variations

2215239 the oceans are what really matter when it comes to global warming
2215240 global warming and other environmental insults were threatening the planet with catastrophe
2215241 the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming follows from the burning of fossil fuels and requires immediate action
2215242 1 500 clergy theologians religious leaders scientists academics and policy experts concerned about the harm that
2215243 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate moreover there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the earth
2215244 when politicians and journalists declare that the science of global warming is settled they show a regrettable ignorance about how science works
2215245 climate research became politicized in favour of one particular hypothesis
2215246 often imagine that anyone who doubts the hypothesis of man made global warming must be in the pay of the oil companies as a result some key discoveries in climate research go almost unreported

2215260 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates

2215272 being a famous designer is like being a famous electrician
2215273 if youre at an electricians conference everybody knows you and as soon as you step out of there nobody has the slightest idea who you are

2215280 theoretically its always possible for someone to get one vote that could make a difference
2215281 it could go down a little or it could go up a little

2215409 as we made our way back to our cars he opened the boot and said theres my rope thats what im going to kill myself with
2215410 i told him to grow up and give me the rope but he just laughed
2215411 he would say suicidal thoughts but i never actually believed that he would do anything it was always a cry for help with gerald thats why i find it hard to believe this time around
2215412 gerald created the debt because he always said if i left him he would leave me with nothing
2215413 its a sort of mixed bag of nerves and excitement really
2215414 i was brought up as an eisteddfodwr and the robes are so unique it has a big effect on you as a child
2215415 its fantastic to come home to cardiff to the home town where the eisteddfod is and to be accepted into the gorsedd its a great honour
2215416 the honour is double or 10 times more when you hear the names of those who have gone before you and the things they have achieved its humbling to be in their number
2215417 we are both extremely proud of the honour the eisteddfod has given matthew words cannot really describe how we both feel today
2215418 we were impressed by the way that poundbury integrates into the landscape and by the way it is easily accessible
2215419 we want to show how a new build can blend into the local environment and create a real sense of community and local identity
2215420 prince charless original concept was laughed at at first but has proved very popular most importantly with the people who live there
2215421 you took advantage of her she was vulnerable and you were in a position of trust as a taxi driver
2215422 in the short term the closure should be deferred because penrhiwllan post office currently doesnt have a postmaster
2215423 by going on this march i am hoping to raise island wide support for the campaign to keep our post offices open
2215424 in many of the communities that i will be visiting the post office is also part of the only village shop
2215425 if the post office closes then the shop will inevitably follow and the heart of the community will disappear
2215426 we want to see post offices thrive so that they can continue to provide an essential service in the communities they serve
2215427 to help achieve this we need to help individual sub postmasters and sub postmistresses have sustainable and viable businesses in the future
2215428 unless something happens to people relevant to you you dont think about it it was quite an eye opener
2215429 three or four of them have already signed up but im going to get all the forms and try to get as many of them signed up as possible
2215430 the whole thing was a real tragedy i knew ben and played with him when he was at the club
2215431 depicting me as a manipulative liar they said i was the same as those who say 9 11 was an inside job
2215432 we defended against the al dura lie now its time to go on the offensive and get the french media to pay the price for supporting an anti semitic lie

2215447 when you realize that there are 32 million children in america who are between ages 5 12 its staggering to think about 1 in 16 children in that age group was enrolled in a lifeway vbs in a southern baptist church

2215531 divinity shapes our ends rough hue them as we may
2215532 further feedback is that there may have been issues with the continuation of ferry services to the island which may impact on property values
2215533 due to the category and current uncertainty of the impact on tourism we would not be able to place any reliance on rental income from the asset if that was the intention
2215534 my first concern is that this bank feels that the cancelling of ki ferries may impact on property values which is totally untrue
2215535 there needs to be some damage control by authorities to correct this misconception
2215536 we were first cab off the rank with the wa buyers so most of our transactions were settled before ki ferries closed
2215537 most areas received close to normal rainfall for july and that pattern looks like continuing into august
2215538 the pattern is favouring fairly regular fronts with no prolonged dry spells forecast la nina has finished which tends to suggest there will be near normal rainfall continuing into spring
2215539 he is considering the options that are available he will respond to the governments allegations and defend himself
2215540 we will prepare a case the president should be there in parliament and defend himself and at least say i am not a crook
2215541 you have a situation where you have one part of the government objecting to the policy of another one its ridiculous
2215542 unless there are major improvements to the roads where the construction traffic would have to travel then we would have no choice but to recommend refusal of these developments
2215543 intervene and to discuss with them how we can overcome this as soon as possible
2215544 it takes into account local factors which have a direct bearing on major projects such as those proposed or likely to be put forward in future labour has demonstrated a blinkered approach to renewable energy for far too long
2215545 the assembly government is currently in discussion with powys county council and other local authorities across wales
2215546 the assembly government and powys council are aware of the transport issues concerned and have commissioned consultants to look into the matter
2215547 this will be used to inform decision making by the relevant determining authority
2215548 if we werent doing patrols it wouldnt be as calm as it is
2215549 in the end we are making a difference because were establishing control
2215550 it pretty much shows us the other side of the war as far as us helping iraqis
2215551 most of the time the people like us being there they like the security
2215552 i feel as an infantryman we can do just about anything
2215553 for me my personal benefit is i get to interact with the people
2215554 the history of human rights in china has always been two steps forward one step back
2215555 the chinese government and people have seriously implemented the solemn commitments made to the international society since beijing won the olympic bid in 2001
2215556 we have spared no effort in terms of security in terms of making a safe games
2215557 nevertheless we want to make the games pleasant and relaxed because it is a festival for people to come over to the games we have to strike a balance
2215558 it is too bad we couldnt go on the square
2215559 we wanted to take pictures at tiananmen gate but this is not surprising china is like this
2215560 this is my sons first time to come to tiananmen square
2215561 it is not easy for china to hold the olympic games so we thought that we should not miss this chance to bring him here
2215562 the continuity that comes with the retention of the nco corps is important in the development of a stronger afghan army
2215563 this will definitely make a difference in the long run
2215564 the regulation was written from an american perspective and had things in it that didnt apply to the afghan army
2215565 once we got the answers from colonel amin we repopulated the regulation with afghan ideas
2215566 it helped not only to give them the best product suited to their army but to give them ownership in the process and the resulting regulation
2215567 these men are professionals their confidence showed they were properly prepared and had rehearsed
2215568 confidence comes from knowing the material they know this material
2215569 our ncos should show and prove that they have the ability to manage and train their soldiers and the officers should support them
2215570 this shows that these ncos know what they are supposed to do
2215571 the 13 year old just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time
2215572 was it really that bad i had to dump him
2215573 was offered a vigorous defense by his counsel in which the prosecutor was able to make his case
2215574 clearly trying to work to reduce the detainee population in guantanamo
2215575 at the same time provide a system that protects the american people from some very very dangerous characters out there
2215576 no other regions in the country have recruited nearly that amount during a training cycle
2215577 today i was told by an afghan general that if kandahar becomes secure all of afghanistan will become secure
2215578 what were doing here in the provinces of kandahar and zabul helmand and oruzgan is designed to create a strong professional afghan national police force an impact here in regard to the security of afghanistan as well as the international community
2215579 were in the most volatile region in the country but were also producing the most trained afghan police than any other region
2215580 for example our efforts to train the afghan national police at the regional training center here in kandahar is limited to only 350 training seats a cycle
2215581 in order to train more than the 350 allowed this cycle we coordinated to send police to attend training at other afghan regional training centers
2215582 adding an additional 150 focused district development trained afghan national police to the community is well worth the extra effort
2215583 as the focused district development program is aging were creating a better training program with each iteration with police officers that graduate
2215584 were honing their skills and their understanding of what it means to be a police officer in this fight
2215585 some of the marksmanship practices of the past were point and shoot usually spray and pray kind of stuff
2215586 so were trying to teach them that controlled marksmanship here at the focused district development cycle training
2215587 theres people looking to stand up for their country to contribute to the security of their country and to do better for themselves and their lives
2215588 on the subject of the vision category community engagement councilmember marcuccio observed that many people still do not have access to electronic media and depend on rockville reports for news about the city she said that citizen engagement with the city is lacking for those not connected with the city electronically councilmember robbins stated that she witnessed significant community engagement in the town square mayor hoffmann suggested that environment could provide an opportunity to promote engagement
2215589 there is a huge difference from how it was before
2215590 its still not perfect but it is an improvement for the students
2215591 once this qadasiya school is finished we will be able to cut classes down by half the amount of students and provide better education for the children
2215592 it prevents ignorance which i believe is what we are fighting against these children need to learn languages history and math so that in the future they can provide a positive impact for this country
2215593 near 40 percent of men who could improve on expressing affection verbally to their children with 20 19 percent of fathers having never said the words i love you to them and 18 75 percent unable to remember the last occasion they did
2215594 under a law introduced in 2002 men and women can both apply for a two year leave to take care of their children but government statistics show that only four percent of those using that law are men fan said from 2002 until now a total of 23 823 people applied for the leave but only 996 of those were men she said
2215595 when fuel gets more expensive wont voters object just as strenuously as they would have if a carbon tax had been imposed in the first place
2215596 you dont have to win over everybody to gain from a campaign stop
2215597 the military is not monolithic it leans republican but it doesnt mean there arent people in the military and military spouses who might be persuaded to support obama
2215598 this taps into a side of the military that takes a beating when it comes to deployments but doesnt get a lot of media attention theres a good bit of frustration in that segment of the military and it might be possible to persuade them to support barack obama
2215599 will his policies keep my family safer healthier and more prosperous
2215600 liberals mock americans who love their country calling them cowboys warmongers religious zealots and jingoists liberals relentlessly oppose the military the pledge of allegiance the flag and national defense liberals malign the flag ban the pledge and hold cocktail parties for americas enemies
2215601 anti flag anti family criminal rights welfare traitors endanger bizarre radical sick corrupt
2215602 were doing all these message events why dont we try a messenger event why dont we find the kind of venue topic setting format atmosphere that highlights gore at his best and most likable people dont vote for issues they vote for a candidate lets show them the candidate
2215603 did you see gore hes totally different he should run for president
2215604 gore is not different gore is immutable that was a messenger event
2215605 gloried in cultural warfare dividing the nation geographically generationally racially religiously he believed that was what all politicians did
2215606 i apologize for it i did not know about these remarks but i take responsibility for them i repudiate them i will certainly make sure that nothing like that happens again
2215607 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
2215608 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
2215609 this iraqi forces surge explains how we can continue to see very low levels of violence even though coalition forces have taken away a lot of combat power based
2215610 the operations in basra really instituted the rule of law there
2215611 the people there are able to live freely again without intimidation and extortion by militias
2215612 what you saw and what youre seeing now in mosul and diyala is a more determined enemy in terms of holding ground
2215613 al qaida is still a viable threat and its not so much theyve given up
2215614 the coalition iraqi security forces and political process have made it much harder to for al qaida to operate in iraq
2215615 the iraqis are really developing and have come a long way
2215616 it takes a while to develop the kind of leadership theyve shown were focusing on that key leadership and bolstering them so we have a vibrant and successful counterinsurgency force
2215617 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2215618 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2215619 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
2215620 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
2215621 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
2215622 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
2215623 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2215624 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2215625 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2215626 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2215627 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2215628 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
2215629 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2215630 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2215631 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2215632 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2215633 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2215634 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2215635 we talk about senator clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well in a role that is in many ways more powerful than the president
2215636 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2215637 there is significant support among top mccain advisers that he make a transformative pick who would change the republican party someone who would appeal to moderate republicans and democrats this pick would be someone who like mccain has taken the unpopular stands made the hard calls and stood firm on principle a person who fills that bill these advisers say is joe lieberman
2215638 you know something the republicans dont want to win this election they dont mccain may want to win but these people around him that are giving him this advice they must not want to win this election
2215639 there is a reason the american people the past 100 years elevated only two sitting senators into the white house jfk and warren harding its because they believe most senators adept at compulsive compromise have no political compass and will sell them out
2215640 were mad as hell and were not going to take it anymore
2215641 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
2215642 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
2215643 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
2215644 i wasnt born in wales and i come from an irish family so right from the beginning i kind of felt like i wasnt really truly welsh
2215645 i didnt really feel a part of it so i think thats part of natural human psychology perhaps to go the other way and reject something you dont feel a part of and thats kind of what happened
2215646 there are things that are hard about it the welsh language there are days when i feel when its difficult
2215647 but generally the improvement i have seen in the time that i have learned has just been amazing and its just been so much fun
2215648 i have just had so so much fun i met amazing people and its been the best thing i have ever done in my life
2215649 im going to be carrying on with it and then i would like to start on spanish and head over to patagonia and work in the welsh language schools and i would like to help other people
2215650 it is so completely possible to learn another language if you can learn as much as i have in 10 months
2215651 was a man on two missions to instil an appreciation of world music on a superficial public and to inspire a sense of true political values to a population which prefers to vote for style not content
2215652 he was also a unique combination of impressive intellectual and bar room buddy
2215653 if you were down hed point out that suffering is inevitable but misery is a choice
2215654 and hed do it with a gentleness of spirit which belied his heart his warmth there wasnt a bitter bone in his body
2215655 this summer do something teens rallied to bring tens of thousands of dollars worth of office supplies to staples store collection points
2215656 todays event is a reminder that the weeks leading up to back to school is a great time to join do something 101 and help supply students in need
2215657 the teens who assembled 5 000 kits today for los angeles students are role models for their peers and exemplify what it means to give back to their communities
2215658 we hope teens will continue to donate throughout the month as we know having the right supplies makes for a successful school year
2215659 enacting a property tax cap is a good starting point but it is only one piece of the puzzle
2215660 we are also going to act on measures to provide help for school districts who are dealing with rising costs that force property taxes to increase including rising pension and energy costs new yorkers are facing challenging economic times the measures we will take up in our special session will provide much needed relief to taxpayers and is the beginning of the process of reducing property taxes and at the same time reconfirms the senates commitment to ensuring our students and schools have the resources they need
2215661 there can be no assurance that impairment charges will not be required in the future and any such amounts may be material
2215662 although we were not able to test these payloads in space nasa achieved success in these two low cost missions by rapidly pulling together expertise
2215663 i have a really old hand me down computer that has hardly worked for the past two years it has a lot of problems and i am excited to get a new computer for school
2215664 i decided it would be nice to switch to a mac because they are low maintenance and it comes with a lot of the software ill need so no extra downloading and configuring my school is only 20 minutes away from home but i dont think ill get to visit that much so the built in chat camera will be nice too
2215665 i didnt bring it into the courts mr gore brought it into the courts
2215666 richard nixon when he lost to john f kennedy thought that the election had been stolen in chicago which was very likely true with the system at the time
2215667 but he did not even think about bringing a court challenge that was his prerogative so if you dont like the courts getting involved talk to mr gore
2215668 bear in mind that the issue wasnt whether or not the election was going to be decided by a court or not it was whether it was going to be decided by the florida court or by the united states supreme court for a federal election
2215669 i mean one side or the other was going to feel that was a politicized decision but that goes with the territory
2215670 i dont think our legal system should be that complex i think that any system that requires that many of the countrys best minds and they are the best minds is too complex
2215671 if you look at the figures where does the top of the class in college go to it goes into law they dont go into teaching now i love the law there is nothing i would rather do but it doesnt produce anything
2215672 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2215673 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2215674 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2215675 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2215676 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2215677 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2215678 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2215679 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2215680 a blogologist who is constantly raising the bar for interest and variety
2215681 a day without walking the berkshires is no day at all
2215682 a veritable cabinet of curiosities the last couple of weeks just keeping scrolling
2215683 only tim at walking the berkshires can follow up a post about one of the worst atrocities in history with a picture of a half naked mermaid you never know what he will have on his mind but it is always interesting
2215684 walking the berkshires a must read for me every day
2215685 walking the berkshires has a great green man featured with the profile and prepares readers for exactly what they get interesting alternative thought and observations
2215686 walking the berkshires a traditional weblog if there is such a thing
2215687 writes candidly in a brilliantly obfuscated and multidimensional way informative and hilarious
2215688 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
2215689 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
2215690 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
2215691 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
2215692 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
2215693 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
2215694 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
2215695 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
2215696 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
2215697 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
2215698 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
2215699 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2215700 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2215701 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2215702 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2215703 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2215704 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2215705 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2215706 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2215707 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2215708 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2215709 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2215710 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2215711 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2215712 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
2215713 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
2215714 hot and cold when it came to afghanistan and chasing al qaeda
2215715 whoa do we want to send more americans to fight and die there
2215716 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2215717 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2215718 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2215719 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2215720 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2215721 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2215722 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2215723 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2215724 for years i kept bright in my mind like scenes from a film what they would have been without that war
2215725 if everyone convicted of a felony or misdemeanor were required to submit a dna sample upon conviction the probability of the defendant having been caught sooner is very high
2215726 the cost of omitting many crimes from the dna databank as is the case under existing law is that those who commit brutal acts of violence may escape identification and remain free to leave more victims in their wake
2215727 this case underscores yet again the crucial importance of dna evidence which is irrefutable proof of guilt or innocence
2215728 after nearly 10 years of avoiding arrest in the two cases the defendant ultimately was done in by his own genes
2215729 he wanted to live in the big country and maybe get famous now that i see all this hes really famous
2215730 i recall him thinking hes better than the rest of us
2215731 i recall him telling stories about having servants growing up and like that
2215732 arizona courts have clearly ruled that prison officials cannot stand in the way of the medical needs of women prisoners
2215733 its regrettable that we need to take extra steps to ensure that sheriff arpaio follows the law
2215734 the courts have already confirmed our position that arizona prison officials cannot ignore the medical needs of prisoners simply because they do not agree with the decision to end a pregnancy
2215735 now given the disregard of the court ruling by sheriff arpaio and his staff it appears that we need to spell out the law more clearly to protect future women detainees
2215736 i hoped that the measures could have more effect than they had in the last week
2215737 all that soil out there are plants that grew 6 000 years ago and didnt decompose completely
2215738 thats what peat is so were just making the same thing happen that happened here for millennia
2215739 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2215740 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2215741 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2215742 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2215743 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2215744 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2215745 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2215746 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2215747 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2215748 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2215749 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2215750 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2215751 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2215752 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2215753 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2215754 who knows the brutal assailant of his own 6 year old daughter
2215755 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2215756 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2215757 the application really does nothing its about teaching you in theory how to become rich through a mantra of some sort it really was a functionless useless application that served no one other than the developer unsuspecting people bought it for 1 000 maybe hoping to get something in return
2215758 apple has said from day one that it was going to in some sense police the app store in terms of questionable content that might be violating other peoples content and trademarks and services
2215759 in this case this was an application that was designed to make the application developer rich
2215760 its apples store like any merchant they have the right to decide what products they are going to put on their shelves particularly products that may be harmful or offensive to customers or that may be violating piracy or trademark laws
2215761 it may appear to some readers that i gave ample and perhaps na ve credence to the prisoners points of view
2215762 something as simple as a couch dumped in a roadside ditch can send minor shudders of curiosity through the traffic flow
2215763 it is not just that american households have more cars
2215764 it is that they are finding new places to take them
2215765 the agony of having to make a left turn during rush hour

2215771 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
2215772 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2215773 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2215774 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2215775 people living in regional areas of western australia can be confident that this government acknowledges and values the role of the rfds as critical and integral to the health and wellbeing of rural patients especially those needing emergency treatment
2215776 we have worked with the rfds and together are confident that this additional funding will mean the rfds will be able to meet response times to required safety standards
2215777 can you imagine perth residents putting up with getting half of the new fiona stanley hospital
2215778 this penny pinching attitude to the regional community and our needs is difficult to comprehend especially given that perths fiona stanley hospital has blown out from 1 1 billion to 1 8 billion a 700 million blowout
2215779 the labor party can find 700 million extra for perth but refuses to give proper support to south west services
2215780 rfds chief executive tim shackleton has welcomed this package and so do i
2215781 mr shackleton has said that the state funding will allow them to expand services which is excellent news for the rfds
2215782 we all know the rfds supplies a vital service to regional areas and has a strong team of financial supporters in the commonwealth government corporate and community donors and the state government
2215783 there is nothing to preclude consideration being given to a further increase in funding in the future if the need can be demonstrated
2215784 this funding will enable us to add more capacity where it is needed
2215785 we are seeking pay parity between paramedics and registered nurses so while we do want a 15 percent pay rise over three years we also want a tiered career structure for our paramedics to reflect their skills and years of training
2215786 this will mean that a paramedic who has worked for 10 years will be on a higher tier and subsequently earn more than a new graduate
2215787 they deserve a career structure similar to what their health colleagues such as registered nurses have
2215788 by not establishing a career structure st john ambulance is not recognising the skills and years of training that their paramedics put into their careers
2215789 also there is a push from paramedics around australia for recognition of tertiary qualifications ie a similar pay scale that we are looking for so even though we are among the best paid all paramedics around australia are underpaid
2215790 st johns has no solution to ramping and encourages hospital attendance due to their fee for service mentality
2215791 when responding to a life threatening emergency st johns now takes nearly twice as long to arrive when compared to 1986
2215792 in 22 years the priority one response time has blown out from 8 3 minutes to over 15 minutes
2215793 better pre hospital care can make the difference when it really counts
2215794 bringing the service under government control will contain costs to the current level alleviate ramping and develop a service ready to meet the expanding growth and subsequent demand in western australia
2215795 the health minister jim mcginty has indicated he would support an inquiry looking at taking ambulance services back in house
2215796 the likelihood of it happening is unknown until such an inquiry has taken place however mr mcgintys support for the inquiry is a positive first step in the right direction we do want the state government to take ambulance services in house however this is not part of this dispute
2215797 we expect redesigned macbooks and macbook pros and a new ipod touch
2215798 piper jaffray believes apple will increase the capacity of the ipod shuffles as well as the ipod nanos but maintain current price points redesigned form factors for the shuffles and nanos are unlikely
2215799 while there has been some speculation that apple will introduce a portable mac based on the multitouch technology in the iphone and ipod touch we do not believe apple will release such a device in september
2215800 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
2215801 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
2215802 apple derives great strategic benefits from keeping tight wraps on products until they are ready to go out the door and the company profits from being able to massage that gee whiz factor rather than going through long beta testing like most vendors do
2215803 a competing vertically integrated model in which a single firm controls both the software and hardware elements of a product has been successful with certain consumer products such as personal computers mobile phones and digital music players
2215804 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off
2215805 at the moment no apps have been blacklisted but by all appearances this had been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for if apple so chooses to shut them down
2215806 every wanna be watergate journalist in the northern hemisphere e mails me with conspiracy theories
2215807 you think im an arrogant expletive who thinks hes above the law and i think youre a slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong
2215808 they were so excited theyre rvers so they can go anywhere on the road find a computer go into the download a book and play it while they drive down the highway
2215809 we also know we are touching only a small percentage of each librarys patrons
2215810 its a like this nice secret that we of course dont want to be kept secret
2215811 material that doesnt take up shelf space and is available 24 7 thats really attractive for libraries
2215812 rather than launch mobileme as a monolithic service we could have launched over the air syncing with iphone to begin with followed by the web applications one by one mail first followed 30 days later if things went well with mail by calendar then 30 days later by contacts
2215813 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
2215814 more to learn about internet services and learn we will the vision of mobileme is both exciting and ambitious and we will press on to make it a service we are all proud of by the end of this year
2215815 it was a miscalculation without exception technology companies have botched launches
2215816 why were they able to get itunes right but not this were they just stretched too thin
2215817 maybe they were a little bit too cocky about this it made logical sense to launch mobileme at the same time as the iphone

2215836 its great to hear the feedback from the participants saying what a friendly town cobar is and offering one of the best venues in the state to hold such a large event
2215837 this has become the modus operandi of the state government
2215838 i have grave concerns about the restructure its another example of the government dumbing down communities and centralising services
2215839 it means were going to have less staff to do the work of more than one board

2215845 the nomination process is one of the most important phases of the electoral cycle
2215846 this is when the community learns exactly who will stand to represent them on their local council
2215847 in the afternoon of wednesday august 13 each of the 90 returning officers across the state will conduct the all important draw to determine the order in which candidates names appear on the ballot paper
2215848 all candidates must ensure that their nominators are enrolled for the council area in which they are standing and nominators should check their own enrolment status
2215849 we suggest that candidates are proposed by more than two nominators in case some nominators are not correctly enrolled
2215850 in conjunction with the completion of the 90m capital works program in 2008 09 a major operational restructure was undertaken at endeavor to deliver improved performance and reduce the cost structure
2215851 in light of current metal prices and to ensure endeavor is well positioned on the cost curve the company is currently reviewing mining out of grades with the objective of minimising the amount of lower grade material extracted this review is expected to be completed by mid august
2215852 it is anticipated these changes will significantly change the current mine plan and mining reserve at endeavor by delivering increased metal grades at a significantly lower tonnage throughput further cost reductions will be implemented to reflect the lower mine throughput
2215853 this higher grade mining operation will also result in improved stope wall stability a reduction of external dilution a decrease in future backfilling requirements better control of mining grades and higher mill recoveries
2215854 as and when zinc and lead prices improve the option to ramp up production to utilise recently installed milling capacity remains available
2215855 an open cut is also at an advanced stage of evaluation that is designed to deliver high margin tonnages to the endeavor operation
2215856 the plan is for an open cut to a depth of 150 metres to extract an initial ore reserve of 560 000 tonnes at 6

2216093 it seemed to sum up what everyone struggling to come back after katrina was feeling i really wanted to bring the city together with that thought
2216094 folk tradition of adapting and transforming songs to serve as anthems to galvanize people in a cause
2216095 everything has changed since katrina even our neighborhoods arent familiar anymore
2216096 youre talking about kids who lost everything their homes their schools and friends
2216097 for some of these kids this music is all they really feel they have and they are very excited about this project
2216098 this stuff just takes a knife to a large part of the security mesh microsoft built into vista said dai zovi to searchsecurity
2216099 the charges against the mayor are very serious and the state of affairs is clearly hurting the business of our community
2216100 i sincerely hope that the mayors legal issues are dealt with quickly so these ongoing sagas no longer interfere with the important work before the leaders in detroit wayne county and the state
2216101 lets take it step by step i want my day in court
2216102 i do not think the answer should be a complete and total remand
2216103 im sure that the mayors family is going to be very happy to have him back home
2216104 in my almost 20 years first as a prosecutor and now as an attorney general i cannot recall ever seeing let alone hearing of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted
2216105 ever since the end of last summer we have seen blow away numbers on the job creation side so does two months make a trend
2216106 keep in mind that when economies slow down a little bit a lot of people actually enroll in universities and do self enriching things so that theyre better prepared to compete in a job market
2216107 the only significant job gains were in accommodation and food services where 22 000 people were hired across the country
2216108 the job losses happened in quebec ontario saskatchewan and prince edward island quebec lost 30 000 jobs and the provincial jobless rate rose to 7 4 per cent ontario lost 19 000 jobs although its unemployment rate actually dropped to 6 4 per cent from 6 7 per cent when about 42 000 people left the job market
2216109 thats because many people especially younger part time workers left the workforce

2216114 demonstrate an apparent acceptance by the legislature that home schooling is taking place in california with home schools allowed as private schools
2216115 todays court ruling held that 1 california statutes permit home schooling as a species of private school education and 2 the statutory permission to home school may constitutionally be overridden in order to protect the safety of a child who has been declared a dependent homeschooling therefore remains a legal educational option in california

2216126 we dont know if the low price is a sign of weakness or generosity

2216130 i was told that the letter was given to him by mr bainimarama before the government team left for china for the olympic games and the letter states that he has until august 22 to clear himself from public office and that will be in the next two weeks
2216131 this means he wont attend the next cabinet meeting on august 22 and i challenge mahen to tell the people that his job is on the line
2216132 and i am prepared to take mahen head on in any battle or whatever battle he may want to take out with me
2216133 this was also confirmed to me and my friends this evening yesterday from a senior government official who is also out of the country saying that mahen is going out of the regime
2216134 this should have been done long time ago because he has only brought problems to the countrys economy
2216135 i dont know if it would have killed me because it was just the drywall and everything

2216139 not only do they need to be efficient with what theyre doing but also anticipate we could have more students riding the bus this fall than we have in the past as it crunches on family budgets as well as the state budget
2216140 were looking at an increase of anywhere from 500 000 to 700 000 over the course of the year because of the gas prices so we have to be efficient and use the resources wisely
2216141 and the other thing the staff is doing is theyre getting ahead of the curve you cant respond the day of
2216142 are a chance for the rest of the world to discover what china really is
2216143 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2216144 i think there are solutions that involve the creation of new energy products new energy platforms for the world
2216145 we have to do what we need to do to conserve and to go greener
2216146 if theres a way to do it with efficient and cost effective procedures we ought to do it in north carolina because agricultures been the bedrock of this state
2216147 both today and in the next ten years it will have a tremendous benefit impact on the economy and the price of gas and natural gas for not just this generation but for future generations
2216148 i can easily spin that in a month move or no move
2216149 newly trained police forces entered the town of afgoye on their way to the capital they came under fire from forces loyal to dismissed police officers from the region and responded
2216150 several people died in the clashes but the situation is now calm the police forces are in complete control of the town
2216151 i saw two dead policemen being taken by colleagues near the districts police headquarters three civilians including a woman were also killed
2216152 some people ask how i can be doing sport when so many people are being killed or dying from famine and drought but being in the olympics is doing something for my country because everyone will support me regardless of their tribal affiliation
2216153 i eat what i can get hold of you cant pick or choose
2216154 you cant complain or blame anyone else for our problems but its different to being in a stable country sometimes i would like to be somewhere else so i could have proper training

2216173 the only key to a lasting peace in somalia is through reconciliation and the reconciliation efforts are progressing well
2216174 i received a telephone call last night thursday telling me i was the next to die
2216175 we will not give up we will not let the insecurity prevent us from helping somali people who are in urgent need of aid
2216176 it seems there is an anti aid worker campaign going on in the afgoye area it looks like the attackers want the aid workers expelled from the region for insecurity to reign
2216177 kariye was one of those who organised the protests over the increase in attacks on aid workers he may have become a target as a result
2216178 all parties to this conflict have an obligation under international law to protect civilians and to refrain from indiscriminate attacks
2216179 yet it seems at every turn the death toll of ordinary somalis is growing far too many of them are women children or aid workers who have no part in this conflict
2216180 the death of tens of civilians in bomb and mortar attacks in mogadishu in the past week the current massive displacement of civilians due to fighting in beletweyne and the latest killing of an aid worker underline the toll conflict is taking on civilian populations and the relief operation
2216181 all this is occurring in the context of a severely deteriorating humanitarian situation in which aid workers themselves subject to attacks in increasing numbers are more and more challenged to reach people with the assistance they require
2216182 the humanitarian situation has deteriorated steadily in the 18 months that i have been emergency relief coordinator
2216183 and has now reached unprecedented desperate levels even in the context of somalia over the last 18 years
2216184 all parties to this conflict have an obligation under international law to protect civilians and to refrain from indiscriminate attacks
2216185 yet it seems at every turn the death toll of ordinary somalis is growing far too many of them are women children or aid workers who have no part in this conflict
2216186 the humanitarian situation has deteriorated steadily in the 18months that i have been emergency relief coordinator
2216187 and has now reached unprecedented desperate levels even in the context of somalia over the last 18 years
2216188 who was the pig that did this to you i want to know
2216189 good morning your daughter has informed me of the problem i cant marry her because of my personal family situation but ill take charge i will pay all costs and provide for your daughter for the rest of her life additionally if a girl is born i will bequeath her 2 retail stores a townhouse a beachfront villa and a 2million bank account if a boy is born my legacy will be a couple of factories and a 4 000 000 bank account if twins they will receive a factory and 2 000 000 each however if there is a miscarriage what do you suggest i do
2216190 do you think you should have taken so many naps
2216191 you are a union that is proud of achieving a muslim holiday and prayer room
2216192 a union in the u s a a country based on christianity you call yourselves americans have you forgotten 9 11
2216193 you had no right to drop labor day muslim employees must integrate labor day into their lives if they are going to live in america
2216194 we in the labor movement have always understood that unions are only strong when we work to protect the dignity of all faiths and that includes muslims
2216195 we had worked 23 labor days in a row it wasnt like it was a day to spend with our family
2216196 contrary to recent reports labor day is still a holiday at tyson foods the issue concerns only the plant at shelbyville
2216197 i remember it being like 40 below or something crazy like that
2216198 but winter is really a breeze when you think about those less fortunate than yourself
2216199 we somalians compare winter to other scenarios we could be stuck in
2216200 if i rhymed about home and got descriptive id make 50 cent look like limp bizkit
2216201 america has places like new orleans with real struggles and i respect those struggles
2216202 that song is me talking to rappers who glorify their hood like its the end of the world somalians are happy if we even get to live in their hood their hood is our salvation
2216203 even though i didnt understand the language just the fact that i was listening to foreign music gave me a place to dream
2216204 the rare rapper who doesnt exploit or more accurately glorify his difficult past his music and words mean a lot to me as an african because it has truth and dignity and its extremely funky
2216205 i used the b 3 hammond organ that bob marley actually used on exodus
2216206 id say i sketched out my first ideas of what i wanted to do musically when i lived there
2216207 i was in the scenario that most somalian people are living in there which is just kind of struggling it out
2216208 in minneapolis when you see the somalian community its clear the lack of representation in the media that was the thing i most thought about when i was there i saw something was missing so id come home and write which started me down this path
2216209 i couldve just been the good entertainer and everybody would have been happy but i had to say something how many kids who came from where i did the streets of mogadishu would ever get that kind of chance
2216210 i could say nothing about the somalian experience and still live pretty well make my money
2216211 but i have a true passion for my country and my people and for justice thats what keeps me from being quiet
2216212 as an artist who wants to speak for all the people its hard to say anything or to take a side even my mother would like for me to not talk about it
2216213 it was not an easy decision to leave all that and return to a totally destroyed country wrecked by civil war
2216214 we dont have leaders in our country but we have managers our aim is to produce visionary leaders in future who can bring back hope and amalgamate our people there is a huge appetite for such leadership and we hope to be the source
2216215 we now waive tax on factory parts and other goods to encourage more diaspora investment the economy is built on them they are our lifeline
2216216 heres somebody who stopped to do the right thing and it led to this cascading series of bad events
2216217 i was hoping that my reaching out that if other people did this that this family would feel this was the right place to come to the right place to live and that it would be a welcoming place for the family
2216218 i was having a nice life i was going to make 4 000 a month
2216219 the money is nothing i can work for it now
2216220 i want at least somebody to tell me what you did was right what we did was wrong
2216221 we have enormous sympathy for his situation and it is very regrettable
2216222 by the same token the decisions that were made were appropriate based on the information that the police had at the time and the information that we had at the time ultimately the system did work
2216223 i guess i was outraged that somebody is trying to help someone and they end up losing their car they end up being the victim
2216224 although they are supposed to adhere to all the obligations that they take on financially here theres not a lot that anyone can do if they pick up and leave
2216225 you have to go through hell to get anything back and our government doesnt really do much of anything about it
2216226 the so called government of somalia has a lot of problems political problems as well as financial problems in the united states
2216227 even though we dont recognize their government we have urged them to deal with their properties sell them if they cant afford them or in some cases fix them up
2216228 there must be someone in the somali government saying dont sell these properties yet because we are trying to get ourselves back together as a government and when we do we will need these properties
2216229 lauren is right on the button with team usas uniform
2216230 with that usa team patch on your chest with those white rings underneath its a pretty powerful symbol
2216231 as i come before you with an optimistic vision of what we can be with an understanding of the challenges that we face at every level but hopeful optimistic willing to do the hard work to get things down running against someone who is angry and negative
2216232 it would be good to have someone in the u s senate with some seniority
2216233 those behind the killing of innocent women cleaning a street lacked any sense of morality
2216234 i guess she watches us everyday she wants to be a part of it
2216235 most parents would say i cant believe your kid wants to be a tattoo artist
2216236 he wanted an anchor so she drew him an anchor
2216237 ive had a bitch of a freaking day and want to go home
2216238 we have gone through many internal difficulties in the past 18 years
2216239 i hope sports can be used as a tool to bring peace to our country and all the country can unite as a whole to support our two athletes
2216240 two unidentified men armed with handguns shot him three times in the head as he was entering his home he is dead now
2216241 he leaves behind about 200 orphans in the centre he had been running for 18 years
2216242 many orphans and displaced families will miss him theres no doubt nobody knows why anyone would target a man like him who looks after the needy
2216243 i saw the attackers running away after they shot him he died on the spot right in front of his house
2216244 we bought it from kenya after normal supplies dwindled due to delays we saw an opportunity and took it
2216245 we work in three groups one group is at sea now looking for ships to hijack the other two including mine are next in line we all share the ransom money
2216246 they have gained experience and hijack big ships that fetch them good money
2216247 we dont fear the government girls here are not afraid of us they love us because we have lots of money so they really want to marry us
2216248 if i marry a man who doesnt have enough money he cannot organise such a big wedding
2216249 that is why girls here prefer to be married to pirates
2216250 we need to build a new strategic engagement with popular voices in somalia
2216251 we have terrorists in our midst still planning awful deeds
2216252 i truly believe that the fact that kenya and the united states have both moved ahead to strengthen their democracies and to expand well being for their people is probably the best honour we could possibly pay to those victims
2216253 therefore decree no opm 266 07 08 issued from the office of the prime minister on july 29 2008 and signed by the prime minister has no force of law and is null and void
2216254 securing sea routes such as those off the horn of africa
2216255 there i was disputing a space in the line with poor people who had little or no education
2216256 i want to prove myself lets be honest im not coming off the greatest year in my career so this is a great opportunity for me
2216257 being captain its my obligation to get this team to the playoffs i plan on making this team a contender every single year and i think we are putting the right guys together to do that
2216258 with livecommunity six groups has solved the problem of producer consumer interaction
2216259 next08 ha just saw me on a huge monitor twittering along way cool they are showing the next08 hashtag hope it will be on all rooms
2216260 a well used tool by webmasters looking to increase the interactive features of their site and get to know their visitors better
2216261 should have but didnt intervene to save us so therefore either there is no god or god is evil or at best irrelevant to us
2216262 there is no god all there is is power and we have to wield it just as brutally as those who once oppressed us because global ethical standards of human rights and respect for the other are all an unrealistic fantasy the world is governed by the powerful thats what is thats what always will be thats the reality of the world that we cannot be expected to change so get off our backs with all that ethical crap and be realistic which is to say lets us dominate as much as we want for as long as we can
2216263 were just being realistic this is how the world is and you either end up winning or losing so were going to be winner in it
2216264 they are not about the real world of capital they are for our private lives
2216265 is precies hetzelfde als die in andere brandstofcellen vrijwel alles in onze brandstofcel bestaat uit bestaande technologie het verschil zit in de katalysators die suematsu ontwikkelde
2216266 we probeerden het in zuid korea te laten maken maar daar was onvoldoende technologie en deskundigheid beschikbaar
2216267 dat is een generator die voor veel doeleinden gebruikt kan worden
2216268 in de kerk was enige opwinding ontstaan of zon herdenkingsdag wel nodig is
2216269 volgens sommige mensen is de kerkelijke kalender al overvoerd met speciale dagen bovendien is het een paar dagen later hervormingsdag
2216270 en in alle eerlijkheid het plan was bedacht maar nog niet uitgewerkt
2216271 deze crisis zal nog erger worden en langer duren en dieper gaan dan zij oorspronkelijk hadden gedacht
2216272 in het klassieke huwelijksformulier wordt gezegd dat ouders hun kinderen moeten opvoeden in de waarachtige kennis en vreze gods tot hun zaligheid
2216273 ik denk van wel zelf hecht ik er sterk aan om het catechetisch onderwijs rondom de catechismus vorm te geven het vragenboekje van hellenbroek wil ik niet afvallen maar dat zet toch heel anders in je ziet een verschuiving van het persoonlijke naar een meer afstandelijk onderwijs in de waarheid ik vind dat een verschraling
2216274 al wat u ontbreekt schenk ik zo gij t smeekt mild en overvloedig
2216275 wij gebruiken daarvoor onder andere de boekjes uit de serie
2216276 dit is misschien wel n van de meest geliefde uitdrukkingen in evangelische kringen
2216277 ik was wel christelijk opgevoed maar had nog geen persoonlijke relatie met god
2216278 ik weet eigenlijk niet wat dat betekent een persoonlijke relatie met god hebben
2216279 x is our cleanup guy as well as jhonny has done in xs absence
2216280 hitting cleanup was a great learning experience for jhonny and now hes just got to make the mental adjustment to being back in the 5th 6th spot in the lineup
2216281 the idp population is mixed with some households previously displaced from mogadishu the capital and then there are those recently displaced out of beletweyne town by fighting
2216282 they have nothing to eat and fighting continues in parts of the region
2216283 children especially are facing malnutrition diarrhoea malaria whenever someone approaches the idp camps the children quickly gather around you thinking you might have some food for them
2216284 they have not eaten in days i dont know what to do we need food urgently
2216285 food supplies are urgently needed in somalia but deteriorating security has made delivery difficult by land and sea
2216286 canada is stepping up to the plate by tasking ville de qu bec with the role of escorting world food programme ships to ensure their safe arrival at designated ports
2216287 there is no question that august 8 2008 is a special day
2216288 in many traditions the number eight symbolizes a new beginning and the promise of eternal love the pattern 8 is infinite forever there is no greater symbol of the lifelong promise of marriage and the romantic appeal of love that never ends
2216289 were teachers who drink their 8 for our classes start at 8 and we cant be l8 for our students are so gr8 thats why 8 8 08 is the perfect d8 for teachers to cut a wedding c8ke during summer br8k
2216290 in fact according to chinese culture the more eights a couple has in their lives the more luck they will receive so its no surprise that couples across the country have been hurrying to book 08 08 08 as their special day in traveling to celebrate a marriage renewal alisa bowman who turns 38 today and her husband leave today 08 08 08 to wed tried to have two second honeymoons before becoming parents
2216291 our marriage tanked during that time weve spent a lot of effort working out our differences
2216292 this year on my birthday were finally leaving for our second honeymoon
2216293 i specifically did not want to fly on the 8th because i just felt like there was too much going on in the world with the olympics just beginning i also wanted to be with my family at home to watch the opening ceremonies
2216294 it is a big birthday for me so we are celebrating it away and leaving on this date which is supposed to bring good fortune
2216295 now after two kids and too many years we are going to go back but this time to visit paris and to take in a cirque du soliel show
2216296 we appreciate the epa taking a careful approach to the waiver request and agree with their determination that it should be denied
2216297 beyond the environmental and energy security benefits provided by biofuels the opportunity for green jobs and the continued economic development of biodiesel refineries in texas were obviously important considerations for the epa now the states goal of bringing biofuels jobs and energy independence to texas and the nation can continue on a path to success
2216298 it is the legal right of the ruling coalition to bring an impeachment motion but it will not be successful
2216299 the president will face the impeachment move my party and other opposition forces will defend the president in this bid and when the motion would be tabled in the joint session of parliament the numbers game will come to the fore and the nation will know the reality behind the claims made by the government
2216300 however no curfew relaxation was given in rajouri and jourian area in akhnoor
2216301 mirwaiz umar farooq syed ali shah geelani and shabir shah were scheduled to lead demonstrations after friday prayers they were placed under house arrest to defuse the situation
2216302 we wanted to have a mechanism where a common person can get a sim card without any hassles and other security concerns are also met
2216303 so institutionally there will be an in built mechanism for consultations with the state through the representation of the state through these chief secretaries and the dgps
2216304 we did have a discussion on federal agency there are two things federal crime and federal agency there is no relevance of federal crime in india this is a concept in the us where every state has its own definition of every crime in india every penal law is a federal law so there is no question of federal crime
2216305 investigation of any terrorism case is not possible though a single agency so what we are really looking at is the cases where there are inter state and international linkages arms and drugs smuggling it is difficult for any state agency to get to the bottom of the case
2216306 we are very confident of a clear win on numbers game
2216307 the maoists should create an atmosphere of confidence by returning the property they seized in the past and halting the acts of terror intimidation extortion and abduction being carried out by the maoist affiliated young communist league

2216312 of course by the way are you the owner of a russian team it can be arranged for 40 million per year
2216313 it makes it a lot harder to hit fairways when the wind is blowing like this youve got to hit it right down the middle and you cant really attack these greens from the rough
2216314 the conditions were much tougher than i expected this morning so i was happy that i was still able to go out and put together a decent score
2216315 the putter was the key to the round i putted pretty well yesterday but the greens were spiked up so i was excited about what i would be able to do in fresher conditions today
2216316 you never know you might shoot an 8 over and it comes down to sunday and you can still have a chance to win
2216317 the course is playing a lot harder today than yesterday
2216318 the winds a lot harder i know the guys playing in the afternoon its going to be very challenging for them

2216323 god he is following us you see him right now
2216324 yes and today he is being silly he makes me laugh
2216325 yes every night i see him almost and the angels they come to me in my dreams and sometimes in the house or outside
2216326 they always tell me that they love me that i need to be strong and be a good sister they sing to me and sometimes they play with my hair to help me fall asleep

2216329 which you need to take different peoples opinions as to whether that is fair
2216330 the roughs are raked every day so that they are more uniform and the grass stands up
2216331 it was not done any differently last night wednesday than it was any other night this week
2216332 it will be tough for the remainder of the week i cant see it getting any easier
2216333 i sound as if i am moaning which i am but it is a great shame as it is a fantastic golf course
2216334 they are great greens and they are playable but there is no need to play it as it is
2216335 thats the sort of thing you are battling against out there
2216336 i thought it would be a little firmer a little faster but it got a lot firmer and a lot faster
2216337 you have to reward the accurate players like they did at the u s open
2216338 i think the u s open was set up perfectly it rewards accuracy and penalizes you if you are off line i didnt see that today
2216339 they said no if you are slightly off line you are crucified
2216340 in my opinion it is too thick around the greens as well it takes the skill away from chipping you dont need it the course is 7 500 yards long the greens are firm and the pins are tucked away
2216341 they are sucking the fun out of the major championships when you set it up like that
2216342 the bunkers are completely flooded we cleared the water away from some greens and some are perfect with thunder storms expected in the afternoon it would be unfair to commence the second round

2216351 in a changing marketplace emphasizing fuel economy technology cadillac is proud to be the only luxury brand offering a hybrid in this segment
2216352 i really want to play on the team but thinking about it would get in my way it almost would make me try too hard to get on the team so if i just focus on what gets me to play well it will me get on the team and if i do get on the team it will help me play well in the ryder cup
2216353 it was a big gallery for a thursday tee time
2216354 and now i have 10 days to prove im innocent
2216355 if you had rees jones redo scrabble hed leave out the vowels
2216356 try to remember that i actually can play golf even though it didnt look like that on the first hole
2216357 my caddie said remember we played with tiger in the u s open and i think he took 6 down the first hole pretty much every day so you can shoot a good round from here as well
2216358 ive been on that ryder cup bubble and she thought the last thing we needed was for her to come here on the bag and be a story and take away from all that she did it she said this was not a good time for it
2216359 then i saw a half dozen cars just like it
2216360 but the others they took the center console out of every car i dont know why they didnt take mine maybe i had it on the wrong channel
2216361 can you tell me about your shot on 18 and what you did there on your approach shot what happened did you miss it left or right please
2216362 you tell me how you won the masters and ill answer the question
2216363 i have had lasik surgery and have been wearing lasik lenses which have a hard center and flatten out at the end
2216364 i had got some infection in there and my doctor said that i needed to let my eyes rest by keeping the contacts out
2216365 he gave me cortisone and steroids which were very painful and it was annoying and difficult to be to trying to fight a tough golf course and have my eye aggravating me at the same time
2216366 i love the pga championship and i hate to not be continuing but i have got to get ready for the ryder cup
2216367 im really jet lagged from it because ive been on the road so much
2216368 we had to mime at certain points because it got too complicated with the one word dialogue
2216369 its amazing that a european has not won in such a long time
2216370 when you consider the strength of european golf especially over the last few years the likes of nick faldo and seve and woosie and bernhard and sam and people like that monty had a good chance at a couple and its amazing that none of us would win
2216371 ask faldo when he came out at 18 19 years old he was a proper golfer but in everybodys eyes hes underachieved until this point
2216372 with padraig winning a couple when he does it it helps other players as well to see that its possible
2216373 they are all friends and they edge each other on
2216374 when one of them wins it opens a lot of doors in their heads
2216375 my match with karen that was a grind but it was a great learning experience
2216376 i forced the issue in my match with karen and i learned that i have to stay patient
2216377 im pretty pumped up right now whatever i have i have to work with it
2216378 i didnt take it so bad losing the first hole
2216379 theres lots of holes left and im really enjoying the course so i was sure that birdie opportunities would come
2216380 i was expecting someone like alexis thompson to be in the quarters
2216381 the fact that im the youngest left is nerve wracking but really cool
2216382 she had a strategy for match play and when i was out there i didnt on par 5s shed lay up to 100 yards and stick it
2216383 the fact that i had a really big lead and falling back down i was really upset so i tried to stay cool
2216384 i look at my opponents stroke play and match play scorecards
2216385 right before i played cindy lacrosse in the round of 32 i found out she won 9 and 7 and i was like oh my god
2216386 ive been hitting the ball great for the past three years
2216387 really my putting has been the thing whether i go low or not
2216388 i was hitting the ball well but i feel like im putting better now
2216389 im very happy for them were like a team together
2216390 im very happy with myself that i could come back in the end
2216391 some may call you elitist over privileged preening with a snotty sense of entitlement i call you my hero

2216404 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
2216405 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
2216406 this is a rampant problem across the whole retail industry
2216407 i would say half the retail networks today are extremely vulnerable from a wireless perspective
2216408 a lot of stores just set wi fi up and forgot about it
2216409 but thats not how security has evolved hacking has evolved where fences are not high enough upgrading wireless technology in a large retail establishment with 3 000 stores could be a costly effort but has to be done

2216414 i was surprised at the transition how different the course was from yesterday to today overnight
2216415 i thought it would be a little firmer a little faster but it got a lot firmer and a lot faster
2216416 i think anybody who or most of the guys i think played a couple practice rounds monday and tuesday and it changed very quickly
2216417 thats going to make it play pretty difficult on the weekend unless we get some rain
2216418 anything around par is a good score given that i started with a few bogeys im really pleased with the way i came back and finished the round
2216419 but there are some low scores out there because there are some pins that are low that you can get to
2216420 i made some good birdie putts out there i also made some good par putts to keep the round going but i also let a few get away and im going to try to work on that tonight
2216421 as good as he scrambles its a perfect course for him because his length is going to be an advantage and then his short game is so darn good
2216422 anytime you bring in the green aspect of the tournament youve got to give it to a guy that has the ability that he does to make pars and birdies from dead kinda like that tw guy
2216423 maybe it helps that way focuses on the pain more than oh i need to hole this putt and i dont want to make a double or make a bogey
2216424 you just follow the process and routine and you make the putt for par or birdie
2216425 i got an mri done three weeks ago the doctor said i need four weeks off
2216426 he was short on about six putts under 8 feet
2216427 nu al betaalt iedereen zon 4000 euro per jaar aan premie
2216428 mensen blijven daartoe bereid mits dat geld goed wordt besteed dus wel voor de bouw van eenpersoonskamers in tehuizen niet voor bureautjes die je tegen vergoeding vertellen hoe je je eigen oma mee kunt nemen naar de film voor 45 euro per uur
2216429 voor afwijkend gedrag moet weer ruimte komen vroeger kregen mensen die niet goed meekonden een baantje op de postkamer nu komt iemand op de wachtlijst voor een sociale werkplaats ook van kinderen met gedragsproblemen wordt verwacht dat ze presteren veel eerder dan vroeger wordt ergens een medisch label aan gehangen
2216430 de vraag naar hulp blijft groeien vooral onder jongeren het is beangstigend dat zoveel kinderen al in een behandeltraject zitten
2216431 de begeleiding wordt niet voor iedereen geschrapt voor zware gevallen blijft er altijd hulp maar waarom moet iemand die slecht ter been is een dure boodschappenservice krijgen supermarkten bezorgen ook aan huis we moeten scherpere grenzen trekken wat kunnen mensen zelf regelen en wat is de verantwoordelijkheid van gemeenten ik wil de problemen niet bij anderen over de muur gooien maar soms moet je als overheid durven zeggen dit doen we niet
2216432 niet iedereen kan 24 uur per dag priv zorg krijgen dan zou de awbz vijf keer zo duur worden soms helpt een verpleeghuis tegen vereenzaming
2216433 destijds is besloten om een onafhankelijke instelling te laten bepalen welke hulp iemand nodig had zo werd voorkomen dat organisaties onnodig dure hulp declareerden maar het wantrouwen is doorgeslagen

2216437 nicole started flirting with will like crazy and he was loving it
2216438 they were all over each other on the dance floor even kissing i dont think they noticed anyone else in the club they ordered bottles of mo t amp chandon all night like they were bottles of water
2216439 little roller up along first behind the bag it gets through buckner here comes knight and the mets win it
2216440 my fellow beasts you know who your next target should be
2216441 but i think its a program going in the right direction so its going to be fun as well there are some very good boosters there and i think we can get the program going
2216442 as an assistant ive been blessed to work with two golf coaches association of america hall of fame coaches those two probably have forgotten more about college golf than ill ever know
2216443 now i have the opportunity to use what i learned from those guys and put it into my own program
2216444 its a smaller school about 28 000 students but it has a lot of potential
2216445 theyre really starting to build their athletic programs theyre going to start football and have gotten a booster club going which is already raising funds i really like the direction they are taking
2216446 well only have one senior so its a pretty young team
2216447 my first task is to get in there and let them know this is a team and were all in it together
2216448 i want us to play against the best competition we can
2216449 thats what we did at arizona and thats what i want to do here i know its going to take a little time but i think the utsa golf program can become one of the top programs in the country
2216450 for the first seven months of this year revenues topped nt 78
2216451 50 years of the final four behind the lens of rich clarkson
2216452 impressive i would not have watched golf in this kind of weather
2216453 it was fun to see so many people out there today and that so many of them stayed on the course after all it took us five hours to complete the round
2216454 ive had more bogeys than birdies in the last two and half months so this was really nice you have to be patient in this kind of weather its difficult to keep the grips dry but the greens were superb and i putted extremely well
2216455 i am grateful for the opportunity to become the next head coach at utsa
2216456 its been a goal of mine to be one in charge of a program
2216457 the red icon on your iphone or ipod touch always reminds you and others when you show it to them that you were rich enough to afford this its a work of art with no hidden function at all
2216458 theres only one guy whos going to like this place by the end of the week
2216459 the course is 7 500 yards long the greens are firm and the pins are tucked away
2216460 they are sucking the fun out of the major championships when you set it up like that
2216461 i sound as if im moaning which i am but its a great shame
2216462 its a fantastic golf course they are great greens and they are playable but there is no need to play it as it is
2216463 try to remember that i actually can play golf even though it didnt look like that on the first hole
2216464 my caddie said remember we played with tiger in the u s open and i think he took 6 down the first hole pretty much every day so you can shoot a good round from here as well
2216465 this is one of the clubs that prides itself on how hard it is i dont think anyone expected it to be easy it wouldnt be a monster if it was
2216466 if you had rees jones redo scrabble hed leave out the vowels
2216467 to stop the ball on that green when theres a lot of breeze from behind that was good
2216468 and you do need to hit a lot of drivers on this golf course
2216469 his work ethic and his high golf iq are going to help him build a national contender
2216470 you dont always know what to expect from freshmen but these guys henley and english stepped right in and got the job done
2216471 we were disappointed the way we finished at nationals but in looking back overall we had a very good year
2216472 we really felt we had a team capable of winning it all ncaa but it just wasnt our week
2216473 and today i knew there were some people helping along the way
2216474 i had a pretty good streak going then had a couple of tough spots but overall im very pleased with the season
2216475 it was a fun year and with the players we have coming in im really looking forward to next season
2216476 if anybody needs proof that the changes that have been made in collegiate golf over the last year are good
2216477 i thought theres no way you dont just wake up and shoot 5 under after shooting 14 and 15 over
2216478 last night we had a pretty good heart to heart and they responded
2216479 there were funnel cloud sightings around franklin county and treetops were blown off
2216480 he said to me im one of the poor rockefellers
2216481 clark was not what you would call smooth i think he said he was a writer but i dont ever recall him working
2216482 my daughter knew him through the church he showed inappropriate interest in younger girls my daughter was 17 and he was about 24 at the time i just cut him off from my daughter i didnt like him
2216483 he brought her flowers and wanted to talk to her every sunday he would hang around outside our home and she would have to sneak out of the house to avoid him she would tell me that creepy guy was hanging around after her
2216484 he was very amiable and well dressed he came here for two or three years i thought he was a hanger on but he got friendly with all the wealthy ladies
2216485 he certainly didnt have any money we didnt know how he lived he told so many stories that turned out to be lies i didnt believe anything he had to say
2216486 he would come into our office in south pasadena two or three times a month to do his show he was a really nice guy very friendly
2216487 i know he was big on classical music i remember he used to drive down the road blasting classical music from his car which was a convertible and he would conduct the music with his hands as he was driving
2216488 he went to my friend and asked for the chainsaw my friend told me all about it i think the police knew all of that because my friend told me he went to the police this was after the disappearance
2216489 he was younger than most of the members and brought a youthful presence with him that i remember that british accent we just loved it
2216490 we thought he was the heir to some fortune he came across as a fairly well off guy wandering around looking for something to do as many heirs to fortunes do
2216491 he was really ingratiating himself to members of the club
2216492 he had this british accent and seemed friendly he had a nice personality
2216493 he wanted to be as involved as he could with the club then he literally just vanished i dont remember there being any suspicion that he was involved in the missing people at the time
2216494 christopher chichester was the only name we knew him by and we had no reason to think he was called anything else
2216495 he looked familiar when i first saw him but i couldnt say his face just clicked into place for me
2216496 the two words that come to mind are brazen and sad
2216497 all radio stations are equally vested in the integrity of the ratings data
2216498 the residents with their zest for life and the typical charm make this place so amiable
2216499 he said he was from bavaria we were a modest middle class family and he would say things like i would never live like this he knew where the line was and he flirted with it
2216500 we did not really end up on a happy note
2216501 it turned out he was from a poor working class background
2216502 for a while after he moved out my mother was getting calls from him
2216503 she said how are you going to vote if youre not a citizen
2216504 this now gives us complete control of 15 17 19 and 21 hendry st

2216509 right now hes just a person of interest were not pursuing him as a murder suspect
2216510 we have knowledge of this case by u s authorities and we are checking possible connections to germany
2216511 you never allow your client innocent or guilty to talk to police except under exceptional circumstances
2216512 hes a loving father thats all i see in him everything else is just speculation
2216513 obviously he was reported missing from the address where the bones were found but the reality is we dont know
2216514 and they were going to be gone for a week or two
2216515 whoever the challenger is thats fine weve got a strong record already and im just getting started
2216516 he tells me hes not going to do it if im here and im planning to be here so i assume im not going to have to deal with him
2216517 we want to be focused on long term solutions that may not have a short term political benefit but will make a difference in quality of life if that invites a challenger thats fine
2216518 im committed to staying right here i like this job and if the people will have me ill be here for a second term
2216519 my predecessors have done the job and gotten the heck out of here as fast as they could so i think people are wary about another governor who chooses to do that
2216520 the speculation and early organizing is a function of obamas lead in the national polls
2216521 in a sense its a vote of no confidence in the political prowess of tim murray
2216522 ive seen his demeanor go from charming to acidic if he didnt get what he wanted
2216523 the mental image of clark rockefeller or whoever he is sitting in a jail would be poetic justice
2216524 certainly clark is in my prayers it seems hell need them
2216525 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2216526 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2216527 i dont think too many people question that i think a lot of people question what happened this offseason
2216528 you see teams go out in free agency and spend on a lot of guys and everyone says oh theyre going to be great and go to the
2216529 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2216530 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2216531 you win the super bowl and i promise you will get a key
2216532 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2216533 he still has the utmost amount of respect from the guys in this locker room here and we wish him well wish him a good season and hope to see him in tampa
2216534 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2216535 it is good to have him here when you play with a legend you cant help but feed off of it i think hell fit right in with both the team and the city
2216536 what he didnt say was tell us who was responsible for giving you money to give to me and well urge the authorities to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law
2216537 the letter raises the question is the mccain campaign covering for his bundlers
2216538 an executive from a company that has a billion dollar contract to deliver oil to u s bases in iraq possibly violated election law to funnel contributions to mccain we think that warrants an investigation
2216539 we really are set to have a second century of leading the country in producing energy
2216540 thats going to continue to be a very important part of our economy
2216541 but even with our rich natural resources most of our citizens are still feeling the pinch of the high cost of gas but with innovators in our state on the job working to create new ways to help oklahomans get the most out of a gallon of gas and developing alternatives our state is on the right track to help our nation reduce its reliance on foreign oil from overseas dictators
2216542 in washington its about winners and losers and good or bad its not about what works
2216543 in the end americans are interested in what works what will give us the most abundant supply
2216544 the fact that the american people are telling us to put all the options on the table and come up with the right mix i think thats enormous in a lot of areas were not that far away from solutions

2216580 weve had a number of victims approach us and advise us that they were assaulted beaten with weapons tortured because of money the owed
2216581 we have a number of forcible confinement charges awaiting approval and this incident was being added to those charges
2216582 they are connected through the organized crime drug trade and we could be dealing with some of the same players in some of the charges that are pending and they are all connected to the independent soldiers
2216583 when you are shackled in the basement of a building you could imagine the fear of not knowing when the torture will end the psychological fear is something that is used on the victim
2216584 the rcmp felt they certainly had success with their focus on crack shacks
2216585 but again it causes some other things to happen such as trafficking in parking lots they move to cellular phones and trafficking in parking lots
2216586 this is fuckin ridiculous that i should have to wait this long
2216587 well what the fuck do i have to do to get back there this ankle that im standing and walking on hurts like a motherfucker
2216588 i hope all you people dont die waiting for a room
2216589 this is ridiculous im fucking going to county lets all get out of here
2216590 there is legislation that mandates that boaters have certain equipment on board to navigate in the dark that will have to be looked into to determine if there was any fault
2216591 there were flames coming from all parts of the house it was deemed at that time that it was unsafe to go inside so we fought it from the outside
2216592 there were two people here when we arrived a father and son the father suffered some minor burns i think they were trying to find their pets but we understand that all three dogs got out of the house
2216593 we did receive one unconfirmed report that they saw flames on the back porch so that might suggest that maybe a barbecue
2216594 we did find something in the garage and the rcmp are looking after that
2216595 the problem we ran into was jurisdiction including questions about crown land navigable waters etc we have all that sorted out
2216596 some of them have been freeloading for a very long time some of them have had a pretty good thing going by not having to pay moorage fees weve delivered the notices so the owners cant say they didnt know in the next few weeks well be removing the vessels out of our water lot
2216597 staff have tried to find some commercial space where the boats can be impounded but real estate is pretty expensive in kelowna so we may have to move them to one of our facilities including the landfill because we have space there
2216598 its been alleged that the accused fraudulently placed advertisements on line selling vintage vehicles on ebay
2216599 the victims responded to these adds and paid tens of thousands of dollars in an attempt to purchase these vehicles that money appears to have gone into banks in the calgary area the money was obtained by the accused and the victims never received their vehicles even after several years of trying
2216600 were investigating every angle to determine the involvement of other individuals

2216606 i just found out that i am pregnant with my third baby in three years
2216607 and i dread the way my friends my family and even the people at my parish will respond
2216608 i want this baby but i am not sure i want to tell people because it seems like so many people even faithful catholics just dont get why you would be excited to have your fourth baby in five years
2216609 soon after i announced that we were unexpectedly pregnant with our eighth child
2216610 i came out of mass one day and found an nfp flyer tucked under the windshield wiper of my van i even wondered if it was our pastor who put it there
2216611 ele tentou me amarrar estava armado medo a gente tem achei que ia morrer mas na hora a gente n o pensa pensei na rea o esperei a oportunidade ele me deu uma chance eu aproveitei ele chegou a disparar um tiro que pegou na parede mas podia ser pior porque tinha uma funcion ria minha perto
2216612 the healthier system would allow more flows through the darling and into nsw there is water available in the darling basin and its for sale
2216613 buying these properties would be a win win win for the environment for the communities in the basin and for willing sellers
2216614 the government has known about the problem since the 1980s
2216615 the river is a mess it is a national disgrace they blame global warming and everything else but they do nothing
2216616 we havent had floods since the 1970s not a decent one i am angry about this river and what has happened to it it was a beautiful river and now it is a hazard
2216617 they would swing ropes into the river go canoeing fishing catch yabbies
2216618 this was a magic place now theres nothing when the kids come back with their kids they dont catch anything
2216619 this is quite a natural stoppage this is one of the events where there is a lack of rain
2216620 but with the advent of irrigation on this river we are amplifying the drought these are the worst conditions i have ever seen
2216621 ecologically it is doing a lot of damage within the flood plains billabongs creeks and flood runs
2216622 they allocated more water than it is possible to take out of the system
2216623 we have 15 000 hectares of irrigated wheat in that looks absolutely magnificent we often get tagged as just being a cotton operation well we are not
2216624 this year we have grown sorghum sunflowers wheat we will be growing some cotton at the end of the year and it is highly likely we will grow some soybeans during summer
2216625 the demand for food is driving prices up so it makes these other crops look quite attractive
2216626 its not vital but you might as well get it right
2216627 because what we did was take a great game gears of war 1 for xbox 360 made it run at higher resolutions and added three new hours of really good gameplay and it got lower reviews i think thats bullshit and i dont understand it i cant figure out what it is
2216628 like its an old game well yeah but its new on that platform so i was really surprised to see lower reviews for what i think a much better game it had new multiplayer modes new levels three hours of gameplay you never saw on 360 that the 360 guys are still upset we havent given them right so to get lower reviews for more game thats good it just doesnt make any sense
2216629 his mr hains discussion of the welsh language situation is disappointing and unhelpful
2216630 the essay is pretty dismal if not complacent in its approach to the disproportionate movements of english speaking immigrants inward overwhelmingly from england and young welsh speakers outward which are eroding the foundations of the ever dwindling communities which have been welsh speaking for centuries

2216640 the objectives have always been to make sure that the individuals relying on municipal obligations insured by aca are protected and that the restructuring is resolved in a manner satisfactory to the counterparties with structured finance exposure this deal accomplishes these objectives a great deal of effort and due diligence went into this arrangement on all parts and i am satisfied that the outcome was worth it
2216641 assuming the consummation of a final agreement i would anticipate that the 50 50 sharing arrangement may result in annual revenue between 100 million and 150 million for all asia once the system is rolled out across china
2216642 our results from the first half of 2008 demonstrate our ability to produce revenue growth and increased sales bookings while managing such operational challenges as the qcpr acquisition integration and our divestiture of the australia based lab and radiology assets the qcpr acquisition especially in terms of sales bookings is meeting my expectations and the cumulative total contract value of our signed qcpr contracts now exceeds the 33 million we paid for that business just 10 months ago the recently announced sang and daughters of charity contracts are the largest non government contracts quadramed has signed since i became ceo in late 2005 i believe this recent sales success is market validation of our strategy and the qcpr acquisition decision and further that qcpr is viewed as a competitive clinical information system for the hospital market

2216671 we are pleased with these second quarter financial results especially considering the difficult cost and economic environment while commodity costs continue to be extremely challenging we have been able to offset some of these increased costs with a combination of operating expense reductions and price increases we are intensely focused on maintaining gross margin and streamlining operations in order to improve our operating results i commend our employees for their steadfast commitment during these tough economic times
2216672 we have implemented a plan of continuous improvement and are challenging our entire organization and leaders to find new and better ways to execute our business plan in the face of continued extraordinary raw material cost increases we are working diligently to redesign our brand package channel pricing architecture as this is the key driver of both revenue and gross margin the second half of 2008 will continue to be a very challenging operating environment with the sluggish economy and increased commodity costs although we do expect substantial savings from our recently announced restructuring plan as we enter the second half of 2008
2216673 we continue to be faithful to the mission and values of our company which have provided a strong foundation for many years difficult times such as the current operating environment make us work smarter and more efficiently and i believe we continue to position ourselves for long term success

2216675 unfortunately bloggers dont have the same kind of deep pockets that other media outlets do
2216676 most of them will spend at least a thousand dollars on flights hotels and meals and perhaps rental cars when they see an 850 price tag for dedicated hard line access its possible that many or most of them will simply skip the event
2216677 we need to bring these types of discussion to the political tables as to how we can use the internet for encouraging democratic process
2216678 as we ponder how to support journalism in the new distributed age this seems like a no brainer give us free access to the internet at events and on the street in minneapolis usi wireless could have a system of granting press passes to the public wi fi system for events or even around city hall
2216679 our initial thoughts were to create a wireless mesh network at the
2216680 we had hoped to get funding and have time to do this but we were not able
2216681 providing internet access for citizen journalists would be a good reason for a community wireless mesh network during the rnc
2216682 maybe qwest could be convinced to offer small bloggers and nonprofits a massively discounted rate to encourage the community to talk about the convention process itself

2216808 to bring consumers and real estate professionals together on the web to participate in an ongoing conversation with real estate at its center

2216836 well why dont we do a hybrid of both candidates ideas
2216837 we can do limited off shore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars

2216882 he perdido la capacidad de hacerlo admit a friedman incluso una entrada en el blog de m s de tres o cuatro p rrafos es demasiado para asimilarlo
2216883 descubrieron que las personas que utilizan las webs revelan una forma de actividad superficial saltan de una fuente a otra y rara vez regresan a una fuente ya visitada

2216922 there is no doubt he will fight back but given the odds against him and the unity shown by his political opponents inside and outside parliament he would be well advised to decide to bow out gracefully
2216923 if the president does not get the vote of confidence then immediately with it impeachment proceedings will start
2216924 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful

2216953 this was just the beginning of the discount store like korvettes or two guys
2216954 they survived the caldors and bradlees and ames they just couldnt keep it going
2216955 frankly most peoples attitudes about department stores are a big yawn
2216956 there is a homogeneity to these stores they carry the same stuff i think thats what boscovs found themselves in
2216957 you might find this a little polyannaish but boskovs had some personality
2216958 retailing is recreation it has nothing to do with need we dont need a goddamned thing we buy things because it makes us feel good luckily our economy can afford it
2216959 we tried action against the infiltrators and fired at them that was misconstrued as fire by opposite side on to them
2216960 it is not violation from pak side perhaps misperceptions on either side

2216962 it is surprising that over 45 columns have been deployed in such a small area where the army already has a lot of other commitments riot control is different but the army is also being asked to impose curfew this is a job of the police
2216963 this nation is surviving only due to the army whenever there is a crisis be it floods cyclone riots or any other calamity the army is immediately called in however when it comes to paying us well the same ias and ips officers who mishandled the situation earlier are doled out better deals this is an ungrateful nation and the army needs to say no to doing this time and again then only will these bureaucrats and politicians understand and pay us better
2216964 swim caps were mostly latex and uncomfortable or ill fitting but this is one product category that has seen definite improvement over the years with the newer silicone caps like our best seller at firststreet the fit can be close to perfect silicone stretches to about twice its size and yet it gives a tight fit for nearly all head sizes
2216965 not only do they keep the water out of your ears and relieve pressure on your ears they prevent the cap from slipping off
2216966 youll be swimming along nicely and all of sudden the cap will slip right off then you have to hunt around for it and with wet hair i gather that its practically impossible to get one back on your head
2216967 our swim cap is anatomically designed to evenly grip your head and when youre ready for it to come off the same rear pull tab that helps you get it on so easily also helps you take it off without snagging your hair
2216968 unlike the hard to fit caps that leave hair sticking out top and bottom
2216969 and for those allergic to latex silicone is definitely a blessing
2216970 ive had my expensive hair color turn green in chlorinated water in summers past

2217512 right now is seven nationwide races but theres still the chance for me to do other stuff in other series as well
2217513 whether its cup whether its sports cars ive got the option to do that
2217514 but right now the core of that is probably going to be seven races in nationwide
2217515 i think right now none of the cars on the cup side are running well even since the 40 car closed down the results havent improved but i know for a fact that weve been working really hard back in concord to improve things
2217516 i want to stay in cup but right now ive got to see what my options are you know look at all different things
2217517 i really enjoyed my time in sportscars last year in the alms had a really good time doing that so thats another option for sure

2217530 come november well take a good look at it and well see how things are going
2217531 at the moment i think its important that he just gets a chance to concentrate on his own game because hes been shouldering things for the last five years
2217532 it wouldnt be usual anyway to name a captain at the start of a coaching set up well just see how things go and give him a chance to enjoy his own rugby

2217546 was inspired by toni morrisons novel the bluest eye and shares the themes of african american identity and the insidious effects of racism on the self images of black americans
2217547 over the last 15 months weve traveled to every corner of the united states ive now been in 57 states i think one left to go
2217548 thank you sioux city i said it wrong ive been in iowa for too long im sorry
2217549 sen clinton i think is much better known coming from a nearby state of arkansas so its not surprising that she would have an advantage in some of those states in the middle
2217550 there was something stirring across the country because of what happened in selma ala because some folks are willing to march across a bridge so they got together and barack obama jr was born
2217551 speaking metaphorically about the civil rights movement as a whole
2217552 we only have a certain number of them and if they are all in iraq then its harder for us to use them in afghanistan
2217553 heres something that you will rarely hear from a politician and that is that im not familiar with the hanford uuuuhh site so i dont know exactly whats going on there applause now having said that i promise you ill learn about it by the time i leave here on the ride back to the airport
2217554 then theres the copy of life magazine that obama presents as his racial awakening at age 9 in it he wrote was an article and two accompanying photographs of an african american man physically and mentally scarred by his efforts to lighten his skin in fact the life article and the photographs dont exist say the magazines own historians
2217555 ive made it clear for years that the threat from iran is grave
2217556 yet despite his obvious general intelligence and uplifting and motivational eloquence sen obama reveals this startling economic illiteracy in his policy proposals and economic pronouncements
2217557 protect the dying guild media and our ever diminishing credibility and tenuous job security
2217558 what the fuck exactly is going on here why is this story being blacked out by so called news services which exist supposedly to provide me with information
2217559 enroll their children in a public full time day school or a legally qualified private full time day school
2217560 obama made exactly one point with which it was possible to disagree in the best paragraph of the speech obama called on germans to send more troops to afghanistan
2217561 reject the cold war mind set of the past and resolve to work with russia
2217562 act with the same seriousness of purpose as has germany and reduce the carbon we send into our atmosphere
2217563 welcome immigrants from different lands and shun discrimination against those who dont look like us or worship like we do
2217564 obama speeches almost always have the same narrative arc some problem threatens the odds are against the forces of righteousness but then people of good faith unite and walls come tumbling down
2217565 do you think up all these ideas yourself do they just sort of come to you
2217566 aliens abduct me every night and inject plot ideas into my brain with a story ray
2217567 of course he thinks it all up thats what they do
2217568 they cheat by borrowing from real life if i need to have an apartment in a story i think back to one where i spent a lot of time i know where the living room couch is or where the bedrooms and kitchen are that way i can use reality to save time that i can then use to put into plot dialogue or characterizations
2217569 so you draw from real life you use real things in the stories to make them more believable you could for example write a story about six people around a dinner table using us as characters
2217570 now since i write fantasy the odds are thered be some kind of fantastic element in the story but thats always easy to add later any story with a demon an angel or a vampire in it will sell like hotcakes even now im looking around our dining room and there are stories everywhere
2217571 you see the couple at the table behind my wife
2217572 the classically beautiful woman in green there has decided to marry someone else but she accepted this cruise with the man shes with to give him one more chance to win her heart
2217573 hell no i just made it up but you see you believed for a moment that it might be true thats what writers do they take the mundane world and add enough of the interesting to make people want to spend their money and time on the story
2217574 sssh lets not make a spectacle of ourselves we need to be all look at once
2217575 not just a princess a vampire princess shes definitely one of those
2217576 im going to take a walk around the meet you in the topside bar in a little while
2217577 i can hear whispers across a room youre right you know
2217578 my father was a count and my mother a queen
2217579 i cant have people guessing though its hard enough maintaining an identity in this world of photo ids and computer records
2217580 so youre a real vampire princess and youre going to bite me youre going to drink my blood
2217581 a black corvette convertible with top closed plows into the guy the guy is sort of splayed into the windshield
2217582 this car is speeding away whats going through my mind is you just cant hit a pedestrian and drive away
2217583 we wont be restocking on it anymore or we dont know when the restock will come
2217584 the office of professional responsibility has thoroughly investigated these claims and it is gratifying to see that administrators teachers coaches and student athletes respected the rules
2217585 the vp thing was kinda smart kinda sad in a way its like a fat girl wearing a miniskirt in a last desperate act because its the only thing left that gets a look her way
2217586 mr obama also is scheduled to visit the southern israeli town of s security is every day at risk and threatened she added senator obama will have the opportunity to see that first hand and get a very personal feel for the everyday challenges
2217587 this baby is probably going to annoy me its whole life this is your child yours and gods you will have to care for it
2217588 sorry to put you in a tailspin it cant be harder for you than it is for me
2217589 why does this child look like he has ds too
2217590 according to a report issued by researchers at the university of pennsylvania in 2001 as many as 300 000 children in the united states are at risk for commercial sexual exploitation including trafficking at any given time
2217591 no were not talking about the timetable proposed by barack obama in which troops will be gone in 2010 instead were talking about a timetable proposed by we the iraqi government that says troops will be gone in 2010
2217592 12 months ago we had an iraqi government that was teetering and reeling from internal struggles we had a government that was barely coherent we had a people that wanted to take a stand for a peaceful coexistence with their neighbors but lacked the resources to do so
2217593 12 months ago barack obama was prepared to throw in the towel to give up on the process ignoring the lessons of history and our responsibility
2217594 now senator obama will claim that this request by the people of iraq will substantiate his early position of troop withdrawl
2217595 meanwhile i chose the harder road a course that i felt was the right thing to do for america and for the iraqi people
2217596 obama would have left iraq in turmoil wracked with war and would have allowed it to fester so that in 10 years or 20 another conflict would arise in the region and we would once again have to return
2217597 it would leave a limited number of troops in place to conduct counterterrorism activities and train iraqi forces and the withdrawal could be temporarily suspended if the iraqi government meets a series of benchmarks laid out by the bush administration that list includes a reduction in sectarian violence the equitable distribution of oil revenue government reforms and democratic iraqi driven reconstruction and economic development efforts obamas proposal also would reverse bushs troop increase plan
2217598 mccain will do his best to make it look like the natural result of the surges victory but it wont matter because the salience of the issue will be completely eliminated
2217599 if they want us there they have to show us our troops arent dying in vain and that there is some prospect of success
2217600 shoot they are good to go so now we are too
2217601 we never should have been there in the first place
2217602 a war like no other how the athenians and spartans fought the peloponnesian war

2217604 were still working out the mechanics of the four days and our staffs are in communication with sen hillary clintons staffs but i dont anticipate any problems
2217605 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected
2217606 i know from just what im hearing theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama
2217607 there hasnt been controversy other than what you guys are projecting right now
2217608 you could argue that no one is ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year and hes smart as a whip so theres nothing he cant learn
2217609 hes been very supportive i thought he showed extraordinary restraint in a fairly provocative interview while he was on his trip i couldnt ask for him to be any more gracious than hes been and supportive since the campaign ended

2217612 the charges against the mayor are very serious and the state of affairs is clearly hurting the business of our community
2217613 i sincerely hope that the mayors legal issues are dealt with quickly so these ongoing sagas no longer interfere with the important work before the leaders in detroit wayne county and the state
2217614 lets take it step by step i want my day in court
2217615 i do not think the answer should be a complete and total remand
2217616 im sure that the mayors family is going to be very happy to have him back home

2217648 desperate to avoid the merits of clemenss claims mcnamee moves to dismiss on insubstantial and frivolous grounds that are contrary to controlling authority which requires mcnamee to answer to a texas court and jury for his intentional conduct that injured a texas resident in texas
2217649 because most of the key witnesses in this case are in the southern district of texas the cost of attendance in new york city for willing witnesses is substantially higher than it would be in houston and the courts in the southern district of texas are less congested
2217650 whether mcnamee falsely charged clemens with using steroids in new york texas or on the moon is of little consequence it simply does not change that mcnamees conduct was calculated to and did harm clemens where he lived and worked
2217651 hes kind of brought a new life to our team
2217652 everybody on the bench is looser and having more fun
2217653 i was here for fernando valenzuela mania manny could be something special here hes got a dynamic personality and says things that have appeal he can be energizing the fans here love him

2217656 you lose your no 1 and you lose another guy thats been throwing the ball well for you in chamberlain its things you have to deal with
2217657 youve got to move on thats the only thing you can do in this game
2217658 you cant sit here and hang your head about it
2217659 i dont know i just kept going with what i had
2217660 one of my goals every time out is to give the team a quality outing ive been able to accomplish that this season
2217661 i felt great from the time i warmed up tonight i can only control so much i try to give the club innings and keep us in the game and let our offense work thats why they call it baseball
2217662 he allowed us to get untracked offensively he kept them at bay the way hes pitched this year you have that human emotion and everyone felt that way in our dugout we really wanted to get him a win with the offday today and the fact we wanted jonathan paplebon to pitch an inning i felt it was a good time to take him out
2217663 when wake goes out there we believe we can win
2217664 i dont know if it was a release of emotion or it just was everybodys chance to get some free shots in on me
2217665 i think guys were taking advantage of giving me some rib shots and some jabs im always celebrating everybodys elses at home plate and to get to be the one that jumps into the pile is pretty fun
2217666 and if it doesnt but we win the game what can you do its not like hes scuffling for a job or something
2217667 im a little quicker than sean casey so it was probably the best thing to keep me in the game
2217668 the good news is that theres no break by the time i got out there it was already turning black i think the trainers think theres a decent chance hell play tomorrow so thats good news it sounds like its a matter of a day or two as opposed to something that looked like it had a chance to be bad
2217669 it hurts like heck still its swelling like heck and its bruised up
2217670 its just throbbing swollen and throbbing a little bit little movements here and there hurt but thats whats going to happen when you get hit all the blood and everything is shooting to that trying to protect it but usually when i wake up from stuff like this the next day i feel a lot better
2217671 but then youve got left left left in drew ellsbury and david ortiz that is awfully inviting im open ill actually go change it if you can come up with a better way we spent a lot of time today and were a little confused because pedroia just hits there all the time this way with cora hitting ninth if they do want to bring in the lefty pedroias sitting over there
2217672 i hate that term but ill tell you what hes swung the bat good
2217673 im sure he feels better about himself the approach is there hes getting to some pitches swinging at strikes yeah i think certainly that better days are ahead for him
2217674 be early to the ball and get a pitch i can drive sounds pretty simple
2217675 theres nothing wrong with my swing my swing is fine just a matter of being on time being ready to hit
2217676 the key the key the key of this is pitching
2217677 thats why we had that lead last year the offense was great then you start putting those starts like seven innings seven innings seven innings everything starts falling where it should be
2217678 its a big big outfield 410 to center just running in i wasnt sure if i could get to it and i saw lowrie coming pretty hard and dove for the ball i kind of tucked up thinking we might collide luckily we didnt
2217679 but we gotta win the majority of them to keep ourselves in it
2217680 its huge because of where we are in the standings and having to catch people
2217681 its hard to swallow to lose a 3 0 game with our offense
2217682 but its one of those games where youve got to tip your cap to the pitcher he pitched a heck of a game
2217683 thats something that we definitely think about it and envision
2217684 we actually see it in reality at the same time its very important for us that we also put it in perspective we know its great were enjoying it but lets not get ahead of ourselves we never lose focus in the fact hey lets play the game today its most important for us
2217685 probably the most exciting win ive been involved with here
2217686 he hasnt pitched in a while its going to take some time to build his arm strength back up to build his delivery and his conditioning
2217687 youre talking david pauley charlie zink and devern hansack who have put themselves in that position i think michael bowden is a touch behind that right now but those three guys have really asserted themselves and pitched very consistently
2217688 he doesnt get upset out there i come out and talk to him and hes calm and collected he understands what damage control is
2217689 if youre in last place in august its not a big deal you can withstand one call up going away
2217690 if youre like us and the rays and the yanks and the twins the white sox its different every game matters it could come down to one game if youre playing a doubleheader or you have to make a spot start for whatever reason thats important
2217691 its important to people throughout korea to make a strong showing and to represent the kind of baseball they can play
2217692 i think hes got a really good understanding of trying to be himself not be somebody else
2217693 i told him i was going to give you the prerequisite speech
2217694 its a long season and you go out and play baseball because thats what you do
2217695 when its been that way for the last few years and through no fault of trying it just didnt work out all that well it does make it a little longer than normal but thats part of baseball not everyone can be a part of this atmosphere all the time
2217696 you never know what bay can be on a stage like this
2217697 it rejuvenates you youre in pittsburgh in may youre out of it playing for your stats youre not playing to win playing to finish off the year ive been there its a nightmare i know for him when i got traded from pittsburgh to detroit every game mattered august and september it brings you to another level
2217698 i had a feeling they had a good team their defense got better they knew that the second baseman alexei ramirez he was a special kid and their pitching was all right and they added a few arms in the bullpen it seems like they went back to what they did a few years ago with pitching and defense
2217699 obviously its not the junior of seattle but hes still a dangerous hitter putting him in a situation like the one theyre in you never know they know what theyre doing over there mixing and matching giving everybody a shot to produce
2217700 after the first few swings today it looked like his normal swing and he was driving the ball out of the ballpark
2217701 i dont know if hell be able to play right away he might have to pinch hit for a few games
2217702 i just want to get to the ballpark prepare to play play the game win and go back to the hotel or go home
2217703 im so not concerned with personal things like that my mother actually called me to tell me i was on some kind of streak or something and i just said great ma i guess people think its a big deal and important and i guess it sounds good but really not even close to something i think about
2217704 i think terry francona picked a good time to rest me
2217705 with tomorrow being a day off i think this will do my body some good ive been going pretty hard and this allows me to rest up a little bit i love playing so this feels a little different to get here so early go through my regular routine and then not suit up for the game but i think i actually need it
2217706 im here to play and win i do whatever i can to put myself in that position when im on the road theres one purpose baseball i dont care about doing anything else when the game is over ill think about getting a bite to eat or something but this is my job youre not a baseball player for very long in life so im going to make sure that im doing everything i can i have a routine i stick with it for me getting to the ballpark early gets me acclimated to the stadium im going to play in that night or that series and gets me prepared to go out and face the pitcher if i didnt do it this way i just wouldnt feel as if i was ready to play
2217707 mentally you have to try to find a way to overcome that there have been times this year when ive been banged up and gone out and played thats just a part of our job a lot of people dont know when youre not feeling well and you dont want them to know either
2217708 i dont even know what im hitting on the road but i dont know whether anyone tries to do what i do i just know what i do works for me i have to be as prepared as possible to feel comfortable going into the game thats just me
2217709 i hope i can get in there at some point and help us win a game
2217710 so youre uh a male or a female youre a female correct
2217711 oh my god youve lost a lot of weight havent you
2217712 this is one of the most extreme examples of this ive ever seen
2217713 i was pitching well in triple a and i felt like i wasnt going to go anywhere
2217714 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2217715 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2217716 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2217717 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2217718 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2217719 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2217720 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2217721 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2217722 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2217723 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2217724 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2217725 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2217726 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2217727 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2217728 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2217729 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2217730 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2217731 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2217732 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2217733 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2217734 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2217735 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2217736 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2217737 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2217738 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2217739 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2217740 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2217741 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2217742 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2217743 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2217744 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2217745 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2217746 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2217747 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2217748 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2217749 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2217750 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2217751 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2217752 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2217753 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2217754 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2217755 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2217756 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2217757 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2217758 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2217759 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2217760 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2217761 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2217762 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2217763 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2217764 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2217765 who are open to doing something on the production side
2217766 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2217767 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2217768 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2217769 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2217770 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2217771 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2217772 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2217773 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2217774 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2217775 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2217776 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2217777 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2217778 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2217779 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2217780 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2217781 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2217782 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2217783 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2217784 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2217785 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2217786 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2217787 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2217788 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2217789 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2217790 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2217791 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2217792 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2217793 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2217794 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2217795 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2217796 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

2217840 we had put this much time into getting this house that we decided we could wait longer

2217850 scotlands fishing industry is to be congratulated on its success in achieving msc certification for scottish north sea herring and its work to harvest fish in a sustainable and responsible manner
2217851 scottish seafood is amongst the best in the world and contributes more than 400m to our economy
2217852 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it this threat is real and we cannot shrink from our responsibility to combat it if we could create nato to face down the soviet union we can join in a new and global partnership to dismantle the networks that have struck in madrid and amman in london and bali in washington and new york
2217853 america cannot do this alone the afghan people need our troops and your troops our support and your support to defeat the taliban and al qaida

2217858 you cant tackle the impending obesity pandemic simply by classifying a third of the child population as patients

2217860 i regret that this happened and apologise it was foolish and inappropriate
2217861 it took place over two and a half years ago long before i became a councillor
2217862 i accept the actions of the party and will wish to take part in the formal hearing on my return to scotland
2217863 councillor hanif is currently in pakistan and has not had the opportunity to put his side of the story
2217864 on the face of it he has not broken the law and there is no suggestion of any involvement in anything untoward nevertheless this was very foolish and inappropriate conduct
2217865 he is well aware of the snps strong views against firearms particularly involving children
2217866 the scottish government is determined to help the fishing industry adapt to high fuel costs and although we cant control the price of fuel we will do what we can to help in other ways
2217867 the fishing industry has been particularly hard hit with the crippling increase in fuel prices fuel costs count for as much as half the earnings of boats and cannot be passed on
2217868 in the short term these figures may continue to rise partly because of the cumulative effects of abuse on older drug users but that doesnt mean we should sit back and accept it

2217875 this is an interesting job in an interesting place for a period of time that works for me and aberdeen city council
2217876 we are pleased that mr coomber has decided work with us in a dual role of interim chief executive and external finance adviser
2217877 we are satisfied that he is the right person for the job during this significant time for aberdeen city council
2217878 the facilities were inadequate in terms of hand washing facilities single room accommodation with sufficient toilets appropriate spacing between beds clinical and storage space to facilitate effective infection control practices
2217879 there was no active monitoring of the implementation of antibiotic policies or feedback on usage to clinical staff
2217880 the governance of infection control the development of clinical leadership to board level improvements to patient communication maintenance of a safe environment and death certification practices
2217881 the picture painted by the independent report of the facilities and procedures at the vale of leven is appalling and unacceptable and there should be no doubt nhs ggc owe the patients and the families concerned an unconditional apology
2217882 i would like to thank all the families involved for their open and constructive contribution to the work of the review team
2217883 their messages stand out clearly and i can assure them we are listening and acting
2217884 we have maintained from the start that the report should have been independent of government and nhs scotland
2217885 this was in the main a case of the nhs investigating the nhs
2217886 we also believe that the remit did not fully cover the relationships and contact between health protection scotland nhs scotland the scottish government and the health minister
2217887 lets not forget that 55 people were infected and 18 people died of c diff
2217888 that is probably the worst mortality rate of c diff reported in the united kingdom and most certainly in scotland
2217889 if it had not been for the persistence of the families we are clear that the matter would have been covered up and swept under the carpet
2217890 there has been a massive systems failure and we need an open transparent and independent public inquiry to get answers
2217891 there are clearly lessons that have been learned and a clear need for me now on behalf of nhs greater glasgow and clyde to apologise to the families affected

2217914 how do i put this they were the strange people
2217915 heard a message that id never heard before in my life and ive never left
2217916 id say im a lutheran and when i moved to a new town id only look at lutheran churches now we look for churches the other way around is it a good church what does it do what does it believe in what denomination it belongs to is a secondary issue
2217917 we can take advantage of programs being offered by both denominations
2217918 we started as a baptist church but then we realized that the evangelical free church has a lot of great programs that the baptists dont have and the other way around
2217919 its we join you as opposed to you run us
2217920 we were two small congregations about a block apart that both were in danger of closing
2217921 so we did it out of necessity but weve come to realize that its been very fortunate for us because its consistent with this congregation we want to open our doors to a wider spectrum of folks and having our feet in both denominations helps us cast a wider net in terms of a welcome
2217922 there were a couple of bumps in the road but in the long run its been great
2217923 in the old days you identified yourself by what you werent
2217924 there was fear of other denominations but theres a new paradigm in which we define ourselves by the values we hold in common and that has taken the fear out of it the outsiders have become the insiders
2217925 i think were going to see much more of this in the future
2217926 once the innovators do it others are less fearful of it and denominations are starting to see this as a strength theyre not threatened by it
2217927 it also makes it easier for churches to find ministers maybe they cant find one who comes from their exact religion but they can find one who came out of the same seminary were seeing more of that of presbyterian churches hiring ucc ministers for instance and theyre comfortable with it

2217939 there is also a culture in some parts of victoria police of mistrust and antipathy towards ethical standards and the opi an element of that will always be inevitable but we think theres too much of it within victoria police at the moment
2217940 unfortunately we find that those negative attitudes are being inculcated in far too many constables and senior constables and its very destructive and unhealthy and its something that we are very keen to address
2217941 there was a high level of public interest in the issues raised in each of those inquiries and appropriately so but i have a real concern that the level of publicity was such that it may have demoralised honest hardworking victoria police and that is certainly not my intention
2217942 i dont back down from the need to conduct those public hearings i think the public interest in conducting those inquiries outweighed the consequence that it had but i am very keen to get the balance right between our investigative work and our preventative work
2217943 there are certain hairlines i dont need to know about thank you very much
2217944 i would love to say to all of the fans that i love them and thank you guys for all of the support always go for your dreams and never let anyone tell you that youre not good enough or you cant make it the sky is the limit

2217976 the positive outcomes in this trial pave the way for randomised multi centre clinical trials using mesoblasts allogeneic or unrelated donor cells
2217977 good results are likely to be seen with allogeneic cells as there should be reproducibility of outcomes and enhanced dosage predictability using a batched product deri ved from a young healthy donor
2217978 these results clearly show that our proprietary stem cell technology is safe and effective for speeding up bone fracture repair there is a clear need for a minimally invasive highly effective therapy to accelerate fracture repair and treat or prevent non union and we believe that mesoblasts technology is ideally suited to deliver such a product

2218001 the study is the first description of a genetic factor influencing responsiveness to subcutaneously applied protein based drugs the authors hypothesize that the relationship they have discovered may reflect different levels or structures of subcutaneous collagen type i which in turn affect the bioavailability of the injected hormone if they are correct which must await further studies their findings may extend to a large variety of injected hormones or peptides which may be similarly affected by the skin collagen levels or structure
2218002 one very interesting aspect is that the relationship of the colia1 polymorphism to effect of subcutaneously administered gh might not be restricted only to gh but may also be relevant for other drugs injected subcutaneously
2218003 the main weakness of the study is its small size n 122 pharmacogenetics studies typically require much larger patient cohorts confirmatory studies would be needed before conclusions and clinical applications can be considered
2218004 mps1 is a rational target because of its critical role in preventing aneuploidy
2218005 the russian peacekeeping forces told us several hours ago that they have totally lost control over the separatist forces we are in permanent contact with the russian foreign ministry but it fails to convince the separatist s to cease fire

2218010 as the rates of diabetes in the u s have risen we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of cases of chronic kidney disease
2218011 this trend is alarming since patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease are much more likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke than patients with diabetes alone increasing the urgency to treat the studys findings support existing guidelines that recommend aggressively lowering ldl cholesterol using statin therapy such as lipitor 80 mg to reduce the likelihood of a heart attack or stroke in these high risk patients
2218012 we are pleased that the nih has again recognized the potential of our revolutionary nanoscale single molecule imaging and analysis technology by awarding us this new grant which is explicitly intended to support the development of a platform to produce consistent linearization and imaging of individual dna molecules allowing for high resolution mapping of labeled genomic sites
2218013 this added support will help us accelerate the development of the platform which we believe could add significantly to the understanding of genetic diseases by increasing access to whole genome analysis and by allowing researchers to view and analyze the critical haplotype information that is currently difficult to obtain
2218014 what are the 7 favourite things you enjoyed doing as a child
2218015 forget the techno cures of super expensive big breakthrough vaccine or blockbuster drugs
2218016 rural and remote health services have been under funded and under resourced for long time and have not gotten the same attention that occurs in urban areas
2218017 in times of extreme weather conditions an important rural service like the australian royal flying doctors service may find it hard to reach people
2218018 even though it may not be a substitute for the flying doctors service what telemedicine can do is bring some health services such as doctor consultations to isolated homes via satellite transmission
2218019 look into history for what really advanced humanitys healthy society being able to pump in clean water and drain out and treat wastes from living areas
2218020 could see remote and rural areas being able to reliably and sustainably generate energy for powering hospitals and medical clinics
2218021 i couldnt fit anywhere near all of the stuff i wanted to carry with me
2218022 the whole idea is to give you a one stop shop
2218023 as a consumer you shouldnt have to go anywhere else
2218024 these arent the foolproof gifts that you think because so many people dont redeem them
2218025 if youre afraid of giving an actual gift were telling people to write a check
2218026 people might not be making 100 a year from this
2218027 but its definitely better than having dead plastic sitting in your wallet

2218031 gsk took the responsibility to examine the existing body of clinical data available to us as soon as we learned the results of the d a d cohort
2218032 the d a d findings were certainly unexpected and are inconsistent with what we have seen with our own data gsk believes at this time that the d a d data are inconclusive
2218033 current policies to tackle hiv aids in africa emphasise individual behaviour such as the abc approach to prevention abstain be faithful condomise however these measures require that people have hope for the future and goals to aim for and if wider economic and social circumstances are so poor that people lack hope for the future then these current policies will have limited success
2218034 hope is quite straightforward to measure via questionnaires and surveys can help to identify high risk environments
2218035 although there is not a great deal of experience in developing programmes to increase hope policies such as cash support for children microfinance for small businesses womens education reduced discriminations against sexual minorities and health system reform will improve the wider environment and with more to live for interventions to encourage individuals to change their behaviour are more likely to succeed
2218036 we are pleased with the results from the phase 2a trial as they showed that ormd 0801 was effective and there were no safety issues

2218038 bist du bescheuert die kannst du doch nicht wegschmeissen da ist pfand drauf
2218039 we have found a dictionary of genes critical to a viral infection using these techniques this can be done with any virus
2218040 we are disappointed at nices view that although these drugs are clinically effective their high price means that they are not considered to be value for money for the nhs
2218041 this decision once again raises questions about whether nices system of appraisal is appropriate for all types of drugs it is often difficult to get unequivocal research data in rarer cancers such as metastatic kidney cancer which have a small patient population although we understand that nice often has to make difficult decisions in this case there is a clear separation between what nice finds to be valuable treatment and clinical and patient opinion action is needed to bring these two positions closer together
2218042 possible solutions include looking at the way that pharmaceutical companies are charging the nhs for drugs and whether appropriate allowances are being made by nice to compensate for the lack of large scale trials in these areas we also need to ensure that further results are sought and that larger trials in addition to the nine studies supported by cancer research uk are carried out
2218043 this is a distinct kind of physical connection between two compartments in a cell the cytoplasm and the nucleus
2218044 it really opens up the possibility that there is a basic process going on that affects gene expression in ways that we had not understood before
2218045 the proteins act like players in a game of tug of war
2218046 they will move side to side in an ordered line remaining standing as long as the teams are of similar strengths however once one team pulls with a force that cannot be countered by the second team both teams fall to the ground in a jumble
2218047 this communication is physical and it shows us how chromatin can support a cytoplasmic function while on the other hand microtubules have the ability to affect nuclear functions
2218048 consumers should immediately stop taking rize 2 the occasion rose 4 her and viapro and seek medical advice from their doctor if they are taking other medicines or if they have felt unwell when taking any of these products
2218049 the thing id most like is that my dad would sit in the chair and i would push him once

2218051 whatever the proper resolution of the extraordinarily important questions presented the public interest clearly favors further consideration of issues before defendants are required to take actions that may forever alter the constitutional balance of separation of powers
2218052 the bush cheney administration continues to defy our validly issued congressional subpoenas for information relevant to the politicization of the department of justice by this white house
2218053 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice
2218054 true religion will not let us fall asleep in the comfort of our freedom love thy neighbor is not a piece of advice its a command god my friends is with the poor and god is with us if we are with them this is not a burden this is an adventure

2218062 but sometimes it isnt and sometimes we need something else
2218063 theres a lot of interest out there so we can be really picky
2218064 theyve said most new theaters are maxing out at 14 screens
2218065 they feel that thats the saturation point unless they put out a new batman movie every weekend
2218066 i just think of the rosemont area as being on an island
2218067 some people are scaling back on spending so why would people travel to this muvico theater as much as i love the concept i will not use it on a regular basis
2218068 this is a very low cost way for a homeowner to solve water problems and at the same time do some enhanced landscaping
2218069 finding contractors can even be difficult since the project is on such a small scale
2218070 no we didnt have a van thats why we laughed the next day when we found out that they were saying it was a van

2218075 if youre going to drill drill where you have the ability to drill instead of looking for it
2218076 it is not that they are not needed in elgin
2218077 it is just that in this case they are needed in chicago
2218078 if there are other cities experiencing problems that need help i think that is a good use of resources
2218079 i realized it like a month ago so ive been excited about it since then
2218080 has been talking about her golden birthday since she could read a calendar
2218081 that we realized that this would be a pretty special day
2218082 the purpose of this event is to bring people out so they can bond with each other have fun and play games
2218083 its an opportunity for the community to come and observe the sikh community while having fun participating in the traditional games of the punjab region of india
2218084 its interesting for the little kids to see how hard it is to go out and play it
2218085 whatever time we can give kids its really worth it
2218086 we all try to bring our culture into our kids so that it stays preserved but on the other hand they also have a choice of american culture so hopefully they pick the best of both cultures
2218087 in order to survive you want your heritage to continue but you live in the western world so you want to know what goes on here too
2218088 it would be really good for american people to come out there and just learn about a different culture

2218114 many people have come to make offerings to pachamama for evo
2218115 there is not currently much danger of a counter coup that is largely because mauritanians are used to military coups but also there is no figurehead from which the opposition can really rally around and that is the reason why the military have still kept president abdallahi in custody and why the prime minister is still in custody as well to neutralize the effect of a possible counter coup
2218116 i think that the international community at the time of the elections were very much encouraging of the transition even with the european union calling it a model transition
2218117 mauritania was re engaging with international donors it was also welcome back into the african union fold of course it is difficult for the country to have all the institutions in place to ensure that the transition was going to last but the rapidity with which things have deteriorated in the country cannot be overstated
2218118 this resolution expands the range of restrictive measures adopted by the u n security council
2218119 show restraint when granting new public loans for trade with iran and to also be vigilant on activities taken by financial institutions with banks based in iran
2218120 well in that case i will also not appear on dancing with the stars
2218121 wait does she know that you get paid for being on that show
2218122 a heart is not judged by how much you love but by how much you are loved by others
2218123 parents should be reassured that death after febrile seizures is very rare even in high risk children
2218124 the new study suggests that there is a subset of children with febrile seizures notably those with complex features and underlying neurological abnormalities that may warrant closer attention and followup
2218125 the number of our troops in afghanistan is only going up and so we want to make sure that as were growing that we have the most efficient and effective command structure in place
2218126 more afghan forces are needed to defeat the terrorists and to protect the afghan people and to help the government expand its reach in the country
2218127 last year it became evident when we looked at the figures that the increase was not normal it started by the end of summer 2007 and when we looked at the figures we see that it was increasing mostly on the hudson coast
2218128 at the top of the curve we had i think close to 30 cases in one month this winter
2218129 its just worrisome that we saw an infection that looked like it was receding suddenly remerging
2218130 and thats not just in our jurisdiction i know that thats happening in the n w t its happening in a lot of jurisdictions
2218131 the outcome that i want is what i will get
2218132 wow this universe is a random ass pile of cruel fate and chance i must be free from consciously choosing my actions too
2218133 it is an ideological cultural religious and social army that will be charged with carrying out an intellectual and scientific holy war and to free the minds hearts and souls from the secularist western onslaught and is absolutely prohibited from the use of arms
2218134 they will wait and see what is in the security agreement
2218135 a good and a positive step in the right direction
2218136 the biggest shiite threat to both the iraqi government and the u s led coalition
2218137 now our stance is to watch the political developments and the security agreement
2218138 we will see if there will be a withdrawal timetable or not we will wait for the results these cells have not yet conducted any operations
2218139 there has been some dissent among militiamen when the news first broke about the momahidoun army
2218140 but what muqtada says always turns out at the end to be good

2218146 there are so many stories to tell and so many things going on in the world and when youre able to see it first hand i think it gives you a more empathetic feeling about it i felt like i want to dell everybody i could about what id seen and the way we could erase it and prevent it

2218160 it could lead to a situation where the cost of private health insurance is prohibitive at a time when public health services for older people are inadequate

2218180 hamstring injuries normally need about four to six weeks to recover so whether he plays for us in our world cup qualifiers is in the hands of west ham
2218181 its gutting for me not to be able to start the season especially as i have had a great pre season
2218182 i wanted to hit the ground running and make an immediate impact
2218183 i have probably had the best pre season ever and i think i have shown that i proved my point in that i totally recovered from my injury last year and have returned fitter and stronger like i said i would
2218184 but it wont affect me too much in terms of working through the rehabilitation for this injury and to get back better than before again

2218207 at issue are the moral virtues of accountability and integrity of transparency and honesty of loyalty and commitment to service and the upliftment of the standards of living for the majority of the poor people
2218208 this is the first salvo in what will be a long term response to a long term crisis
2218209 this food crisis is just beginning by early next year it will be deeper and broader as more segments of society are pushed into poverty by the combination of higher prices for food and energy worldwide we must act now
2218210 christian aid is doing everything we can to help but we want to do more
2218211 we are urging people in britain the churches and religious groups to help us increase our support to those most vulnerable to this crisis
2218212 with more cash we can further develop work with our local african partner agencies distributing seeds and livestock and helping communities improve their agricultural productivity to reduce their dependence on highly priced imported foods

2218219 a democratic constitution is not meant to give guarantees to a fleeting majority
2218220 what people are going to remember about that constitution is what they remember of the venezuelan constitution that it will allow for re elections

2218228 if you take the standard measures with respect with drug trafficking you cant make a claim that there has been measurable success and in fact it may be going in the wrong direction

2218240 a lot of places do their food really well but dont do the service so well
2218241 this award will get our name out to a further area and i think this is great for maitland it goes to show that even though we are in a country city we can still offer the service you want in a larger city
2218242 this is a service based award and to win it gives us a great deal of satisfaction
2218243 this has to be as much attributed to our team as anything our approach is we have a lot of very competent individuals who work for us we have our guidelines and we leave our staff to their own devices to manage things
2218244 these awards recognise small business and small business is our life blood

2218270 mexicans are starting to lose faith that the state can win in the war against organized crime
2218271 never going to get this solved unless the people believe their government actually can protect them and unless the people realize they must be part of this effort
2218272 in most of colombia today the people feel they are part of the solution and thats what we dont see in central america or in mexico
2218273 uribe accepted the reality that there were areas in colombia where the central government was not in control or even present
2218274 mexicans have been less willing to discuss the absence of control in many parts of their country
2218275 the mexican state should be dealing with this as a problem of state weakness and not just saying we will take these few dozen guys out and everything will be better
2218276 our project wouldnt have succeeded if it werent for all our brothers and sisters living here
2218277 up until a couple years ago the consensus was that remittances were here to stay

2218285 i cant help but think that maybe if the five of us had been living in a better environment then we wouldnt have ended up with cancer
2218286 i know there are a lot of factors to consider genetic and so on but to me its just too coincidental i believe the cluster of cancer cases in our street is linked to the fumes being emitted from the industrial estate i mean we are a stones throw away from the whole thing
2218287 it may be considered a drop in the ocean to some people but to us its pretty coincidental
2218288 now there is more industry out there and someone is doing the wrong thing its obvious otherwise there wouldnt be this smell and if you ask me the related health problems somebody needs to be prosecuted
2218289 i never thought i would end up with cancer and there i was undergoing four months of chemotherapy five months of radiotherapy and the stress on your family is the biggest thing i think just the stress factor when your family has to go through something like that is horrendous
2218290 the meeting was a farce and the department skirted around the real issue everyone was disgusted because they didnt tell us anything we didnt know but more to the point they showed us that they arent prepared to step in and do what needs to be done
2218291 we felt hung out to dry or hung out to die as the case may be what are we breathing in that we dont know about
2218292 the little girl down the road is a severe asthmatic and the smell plays havoc with that but the department is just ignoring all this
2218293 cancer is bad enough but asthma can kill too and people are suffering i wouldnt mind betting that there has been an increase in the number of people suffering from asthma in our area there are people in our neighbourhood that now have asthma that have never had it before
2218294 it looks a foggy english morning and it just makes you sick its a sickly smell and it burns your eyes
2218295 everybody has the right to breathe healthy fresh air we need to set the precedent here how much more can these people get away with we are not going to stand for it
2218296 saturday nov 10 2007 will be remembered in the history of our america as the day of truth the ideological waterloo
2218297 what i want to express is that mutual respect is a good way to work and to understand each other for the benefit of our people
2218298 you can radically disagree with ideas and with behaviors without having to disqualify anybody
2218299 relies on residents contemplating the police as an ally in the fight against crime not an enemy
2218300 it is true that the immigration issue has raised attention around the country and provoked very strong emotion
2218301 there are some who are trading on those emotions but thats never a sound public policy approach
2218302 we have not found a door conclusively and definitely closed

2218319 we went through a period during which security was the only consideration and society was stripped of all kinds of individual rights

2218352 its important i dont have a climate in newark where documented or not naturalized or not people are afraid to talk with police
2218353 how can we expect businesses in a city like newark or baltimore to support summer jobs for teenagers when they are on the brink of bankruptcy
2218354 that would certainly complete the trail from four mile creek right down to gullivers lane near rathluba estate
2218355 i would also hope to extend the trail from gullivers lane to maitland park
2218356 the part were committed to is four mile creek to maitland park and thats what were hoping to achieve in this next term of council if were elected
2218357 its actually quite important its something that means a lot to us
2218358 i would have been very upset id it had actually been taken away i cant thank the developer enough we have a lot of family back here in new zealand and they are just amazed that a developer would be so considerate
2218359 about 12 months ago the staff chose to have one dollar deducted out of their pay each week
2218360 at the end of the financial year we drew four names out of a hat and they each donated a quarter of the money raised to a charity of their choice

2218381 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2218382 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2218383 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all

2218389 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
2218390 they were the reason we bought this house because it had a big yard for them to run in
2218391 cheye and trinity we support you friends and citizens of berwyn heights

2218395 especially in a matter as high profile as this the court was disappointed that much of the testimony particularly as it related to public figures within the state of new jersey and the dirty laundry associated therewith needed to be aired in the public and in the press
2218396 the mcgreeveys clearly had agendas as previously addressed their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2218397 mr mcgreevey is not seeking employment because he does not need it to sustain himself
2218398 its hard to imagine a more favorable ruling for jim mcgreeveys position

2218402 the charges against the mayor are very serious and the state of affairs is clearly hurting the business of our community
2218403 i sincerely hope that the mayors legal issues are dealt with quickly so these ongoing sagas no longer interfere with the important work before the leaders in wayne county and the state
2218404 lets take it step by step i want my day in court
2218405 i do not think the answer should be a complete and total remand
2218406 im sure that the mayors family is going to be very happy to have him back home
2218407 in my almost 20 years first as a prosecutor and now as an attorney general i cannot recall ever seeing let alone hearing of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted
2218408 we are shocked by this terrible tragedy and our hearts go out to new york police department for arresting a suspect in this crime we continue to cooperate with police and answer any questions they may have
2218409 she has never been in any trouble besides this that doesnt mean she didnt do what was alleged
2218410 but she didnt get a fair trial and everyone has a right to a fair trial
2218411 lea t hampton is going broke glam town 12m in the hole
2218412 everybody perceives east hampton to be the home of the rich and famous
2218413 when the summers over its just the just like all these other towns
2218414 the disparity between rich and poor is probably unmatched anywhere in the world you have the heads of multinational corporations billionaires but of the year round population half the work force are undocumented immigrants living below the poverty level
2218415 i dont mind providing the programs but what the general public has to understand is that we dont manufacture money here
2218416 we have cause to believe that this was a human smuggling operation and so the people involved were illegally in the united states
2218417 the smuggler doesnt care if their cargo lives or dies
2218418 weve got a problem but we dont know how big it is
2218419 the jurys kind of still out on the impact but it cant be a good impact

2218421 the cdc is committed to ensuring that its resources are going to the populations hardest hit by the epidemic
2218422 its often more politically viable to fund programs for women and children and youth
2218423 at a minimum we need to be matching percentages to where the epidemic is
2218424 watch the disease progress in a dish that is to watch what goes right or wrong
2218425 i think well see in years ahead that this opens the door to a new way to treating degenerative diseases
2218426 represent a collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models for the most part in studying them
2218427 the hope is that this will accelerate research and it will create a climate of openness
2218428 at least for the foreseeable future and i would argue forever they are going to be extremely valuable tools
2218429 he wanted to live in the big country and maybe get famous now that i see all this hes really famous
2218430 i recall him thinking hes better than the rest of us
2218431 i recall him telling stories about having servants growing up and like that
2218432 when i confronted her with that she pulled a knife and threatened to kill me thats when i made arrangements to get the kids out
2218433 that line like a tree planted by the water i shall not be moved
2218434 it seemed to sum up what everyone struggling to come back after katrina was feeling i really wanted to bring the city together with that thought
2218435 a song recorded in 1985 by an elite group of artists whose goal was to raise funds to help famine relief efforts in ethiopia
2218436 folk tradition of adapting and transforming songs to serve as anthems to galvanize people in a cause
2218437 everything has changed since katrina even our neighborhoods arent familiar anymore
2218438 youre talking about kids who lost everything their homes their schools and friends
2218439 for some of these kids this music is all they really feel they have and they are very excited about this project
2218440 it takes you back to a very ugly time in history in texas when we killed people because of the color of their skin and their poverty

2218454 this new windfarm demonstrates our commitment to increase the amount of we generate from renewable sources
2218455 sheringham shoal will help provide a significant contribution towards our renewable energy targets
2218456 companies want to build here because we have made the uk one of the most attractive places to invest in wind power
2218457 it is a timely remember for all drivers to be aware about fatigue
2218458 she was very vibrant outgoing and very smart and always tried so hard at school
2218459 she was never over the top but was just a beautiful person
2218460 this is a wonderful boost for womens health in this area
2218461 women in the rural sector deserve good health care and making sure they have access to a female doctor as well as womens health nurses helps provide health care that more women feel comfortable to utilise
2218462 this is the fourth visit of students from my area to come to mudgee and my third visit with them
2218463 all 25 students on this visit are on their first visit to australia
2218464 all of them are being hosted by families of children who attend mudgee high school
2218465 these cultural exchanges are proving very valuable to our students and i hope that mudgee high school students also are able to benefit from our visit
2218466 during this visit the japanese students learnt written and oral english as well as music science and mathematics
2218467 being able to learn english in an australian classroom is a great benefit to our students
2218468 at home there are about 400 foreign teachers of english and 30 of those come from australia
2218469 on the cultural front this time we have shown traditional martial arts such as kendo and kata karate and origami the ancient japanese art of paper folding
2218470 sei gained his black belt just three weeks before coming to australia after just 18 months which is a very short time to reach this level
2218471 he started late as many children start as young as three years of age
2218472 it was agreed at that meeting that no action or decision on dealing with mudgees kangaroo situation should take place until we have better details on the numbers and distribution of kangaroos across the area
2218473 while attacks by kangaroos are rare occurrences we felt it was important the community received information about interactions with kangaroos
2218474 thus in situations where the normal kangaroo reaction would be to attack the intruding kangaroo that is the behaviour they project towards humans
2218475 professor jarman believes it is up to humans to change their behaviour towards kangaroos
2218476 if people are going to smoke they are going to smoke hiding it will not stop them
2218477 people have known that it can be dangerous for quiet a while and they continue to smoke so it really wont make much of a difference
2218478 were talking about 20 years of hundreds and hundreds of coal trains rattling through our towns
2218479 not only will coal trains block our roads in residential areas but the noise vibration and dust will be at levels unacceptable for a residential environment in the 21st century
2218480 i just want to send a clear message to the coal mines that this council will not tolerate it
2218481 a driver whos speeding may be trying to deliver to too many locations in too short a time
2218482 we can help the company restructure their routes to optimize their staffs it makes the fleet more productive and reduces fuel and overtime costs
2218483 the service isnt just about fuel costs but the price of gas helps you open the conversation
2218484 the big objections in our company were that nobody could tell exactly what this 40 per vehicle monitoring was going to do for us
2218485 but once we did the pilot project on 400 service trucks it was great we saved about 300 a vehicle after a year after two years the project paid for itself
2218486 we didnt spy on employees we told them upfront that we were verifying the use of company assets and if they werent abusing the assets they had nothing to worry about
2218487 if you know the slope of a highway through your vehicles navigation system you can reprogram the engine to optimize fuel consumption
2218488 weve got a problem but we dont know how big it is
2218489 the jurys kind of still out on the impact but it cant be a good impact
2218490 sort of the delta airplane hub of the west in terms of migration
2218491 i dont see any circumstances in which military action would be justified against iran full stop
2218492 tried to keep social peace with an alarming series of concessions to sharia and british islamism
2218493 hes going saturday to meet the leaders of the political parties involved in the sadc mandated talks facilitated by south africa
2218494 zanu pf has been put into a corner by domestic and international pressure and that corner is shrinking
2218495 a settlement will be reached but what remains to be seen is whether the agreement can be implemented a formula has to be found to mix oil and water
2218496 a deal making robert mugabe a ceremonial president and morgan tsvangirai a prime minister is probably the one and only way forward now in zimbabwe
2218497 hes going saturday to meet the leaders of the political parties involved in the sadc mandated talks facilitated by south africa
2218498 zanu pf has been put into a corner by domestic and international pressure and that corner is shrinking
2218499 a settlement will be reached but what remains to be seen is whether the agreement can be implemented a formula has to be found to mix oil and water
2218500 a deal making robert mugabe a ceremonial president and morgan tsvangirai a prime minister is probably the one and only way forward now in zimbabwe
2218501 we would expect the meeting after the party representatives return from south africa as of now we expect them back tomorrow friday
2218502 the government as mediator wont give details except to say that the negotiations are progressing extremely well
2218503 i am taking this as a vitamin supplement its all i can afford
2218504 yes there was initially a directive that all ngos must stop operating but we stepped in and said all those involved in hiv aids should not be stoppped because of the delicate nature of their work
2218505 it has had a ripple effect which we need to correct urgently
2218506 i am hoping that the disruption was not long we fear not only relapses but also an emergence of resistance
2218507 some ngos have tried going back to the field but workers have not been free to move with truckloads of food and get stopped at roadblocks and asked for a clearance letter which they would not possess
2218508 one of the children in my feeding programme died recently its heartbreaking
2218509 we want very well that those on arvs should continue we will not allow to stock in some areas and not in others
2218510 all of our people on arvs are able to access them for the next three months
2218511 i get so stressed the moment i start thinking about my status that i lose sleep
2218512 science is a wonderful thing but it is at the end of the day a tool
2218513 there was always the lingering question as to whether you would ever really be able to find differences that would be useful in terms of doing attribution
2218514 finding that you could really apply many of the same parallels with human forensics to microbial forensics
2218515 my recommendation would clearly be to not wait until something happens again because it may not be with anthrax
2218516 theyve got a heavy lift to convince the scientific world theyve nailed it
2218517 if they were engineered by dr ivins its highly unlikely that they would pop up anywhere else
2218518 their case hinges on the fact that these strains came out of this particular flask
2218519 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen mccain
2218520 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2218521 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2218522 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2218523 whatever decision is made its going to be a collaborative decision
2218524 i think all this sort of speculation is much ado about very little
2218525 were just working out the details however those details play out that doesnt change the bottom line the fact that everyones on the same team here
2218526 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2218527 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2218528 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2218529 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2218530 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2218531 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2218532 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2218533 when you look into a mirror do you like whats looking at you now that youve seen your true reflections what on earth are you gonna do
2218534 i actually walked the country to see who i am who i really am but i dont know what the result of that will be
2218535 but for me personally id rather be successful or unsuccessful based on who i really am not based on some plastic ken doll that you put up in front of audiences thats not me you know
2218536 we werent on the same page on the route and coincidentally when that happens bad things happen
2218537 so its one of those things its the first preseason game and we have to get better and get on the right page
2218538 it happens but you have to just keep preparing like when you first got here and hopefully it will work out for you
2218539 when it came to the run plays i wasnt thinking too much my goal when i ran the ball was not to think too much to just lower my shoulders and go
2218540 i think at times i did a good job of that in the passing game i was out there thinking a bit just making sure i knew who to block and where to go on check downs i think i may have missed a couple of check downs but its a good place for me to start next week is a big week for me
2218541 i was just in coverage happened to be in the right spot and the ball was there
2218542 we didnt have a lot of linebackers so it gave them opportunity same thing at cornerback
2218543 id like to think i was making progress im not focusing on that
2218544 im just focusing on whatever i can do to get better
2218545 i cant think about the situational issues or what my progress is just attempting to get better every day
2218546 it counts theres the excitement of the players coming up here and getting a victory in this stadium against this team
2218547 how come i knew that would be the first question
2218548 the games are very important practice too and your gut statistics are important
2218549 i threw four passes completing one and we werent really able to generate much offense
2218550 todays performance is important because im trying to make this ballclub
2218551 on the second one the quarterback gutierrez just telegraphed it he was looking at me the whole way
2218552 the vice president looks forward to participating in the republican national convention and continuing to work for the election of sen mccain and other republican candidates in the coming months
2218553 alright honey put this school girl outfit on then run around
2218554 alright honey put these booty shorts on get on the bed and jump around
2218555 alright honey put this bikini on get in the shower and roll around
2218556 cable is taking share and it is taking it in gulps
2218557 the telcos wired businesses suddenly look not only like they are weakening they look like they are positively collapsing
2218558 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2218559 i believe in renewable fuels i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2218560 agriculture products here in the state of iowa can feed the world and were not afraid to compete with anybody
2218561 this is the heartland of america this is what america is all about this is the people i want to know and meet
2218562 he voted against ethanol subsidies hes opposed to the farm bill
2218563 what it proves is he doesnt care about whats important to iowa
2218564 america is hurting right now weve got a lot of work to do
2218565 just as i have opposed additional consolidation in air passenger service i have serious concerns about the ups dhl alliance my concerns include the transactions effects on service costs consumer choice and jobs
2218566 this alliance is likely to eliminate two cargo air carriers abx and astar which now serve dhl and compete with ups this would lessen or even eliminate competition between ups and dhl in providing overnight package delivery services
2218567 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2218568 its not that youre not ready is not ready yet because when it comes to the economy experience matters and he just doesnt have it he says hell give you change but thats what hell leave you with
2218569 i just saw the opening ceremony and it was amazing my chinese friend lives in beijing and she is watching the diving she could probably hear the crowd cheering and the fireworks from her house
2218570 i am sooooo excited about the olympics i have been looking forward to it since the last one four years ago there are so many sports i want to watch but especially athletics horse riding and diving i hope team gb wins loads of medals i will be cheering the athletes on the whole time
2218571 wow i just saw the opening ceremony and it was so fantastic i hope gb can do something as spectacular something that shows britains progress and history as much as chinas did as for the games its heating up fast good luck gb
2218572 i want gb to get lots of medals but i hate the fact that other tv shows are off because of it there is a 3 week break on some things
2218573 im so excited about the olympics i really hope that great britain do well come on gb
2218574 i really cant wait for the olympics all i care about is the 100m and the 400m
2218575 ive just seen the opening ceremony it was incredible it was really imaginative and exciting and the costumes and lighting were beautiful i particularly liked the 2 008 drummers as they were so together and in time
2218576 i am so excited about the water sports diving will be so cool go great britain
2218577 im not really that bothered but i want team gb to win the most medals
2218578 i think the olympics will be the best this year and am really happy to watch it
2218579 i am excited about the water sports i am not too bothered about anything else because im not interested in them most events take ages so i get bored
2218580 i cant wait until it starts i will be watching gymnastics trampolining and diving i cant wait to see tom daley because he is the best diver ever
2218581 i cant wait for the olympics to start i will be super glued to the tv the whole time
2218582 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
2218583 by using biologically inspired imaging modes in which the electronic eye rotates through small angles and the computer synthesizes a sequence of images we achieve much higher levels of effective resolution
2218584 the small number of pixels is limited only by our university clean room fabrication facilities theoretical analysis by our collaborators at northwestern confirm the compatibility of the basic approaches with much higher numbers of detector pixels
2218585 hemispherical detector arrays are also much better suited for use as retinal implants than flat detectors
2218586 the ability to wrap high quality silicon devices onto complex surfaces and biological tissues adds very interesting and powerful capabilities to electronic and optoelectronic device design
2218587 in our present fabrication sequence the thin elastomer drumhead is used only as an element to accomplish the planar to hemispherical geometry transformation
2218588 man john mccain really sucks but since nobodys tried to register me i guess im not gonna vote
2218589 whats most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2218590 i wholeheartedly condemn the violation of georgias sovereignty i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this arms conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks
2218591 these incendiary and personal attacks have no place in our politics and will do nothing to help the good people of tennessee
2218592 whats most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2218593 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations withdraw all forces from the sovereign territory of georgia
2218594 the u s should immediately convene an emergency session of the u n security council to call on russia to reverse course
2218595 i dont know an awful lot about jimmy mullen but i know he was at burnley
2218596 i dont know if walsall could sustain a championship side but i think they should be looking to get in there that has got to be their aim
2218597 i think if they get to the play offs they will have had a very very good season
2218598 at the end of the season you want to relax and switch off but youve got to be fresh go on trials and try to prove youre good enough
2218599 it gets harder and harder as the years go by especially around the smaller clubs
2218600 basically the budget at darlington had been slashed by half and they took me into the office to tell me they couldnt keep me because they hadnt got the funds
2218601 they talked to me about their situation i talked to them about my situation and it was best for both parties that i got out i knew kings lynn were interested and the club is in an ideal location as its near home in boston
2218602 about 15 to 20 thats 1 6 of footballers are losing their jobs at the end of every season
2218603 if you or i were in an industry with a turnover that high then wed be seriously worried adding to the insecurities players face they are also increasingly being given short term contracts and not two year contracts like they used to
2218604 if you look at the standard of league one and league two its becoming higher and higher
2218605 youve got clubs like shrewsbury spending 170 000 on players so its becoming tougher to get the right calibre of player
2218606 telling a player he is no longer wanted is something that you get used to i think the player usually has an idea so its not that difficult when it catches a player by surprise then its a case of explaining why but life goes on
2218607 it is not a nice thing to tell people but it is a necessity youve got to do it because football is a rat race it is a results orientated business
2218608 if a manager doesnt get results then he gets the sack so if a player does not do his job then he has to go and someone else has got to come in it is a vicious circle but unfortunately thats the way football is
2218609 nearly 99 of boys want to become footballers so when they walk through our doors youve got to tell them the truth not everybody makes it
2218610 youve got the be in the right place at the right time the boys come in and theyre very negative in the way they play because they worry too much about making mistakes its a case of changing their thought process
2218611 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough obama voted to raise taxes on people making just 42 000 he promises more taxes on small business seniors your life savings your family painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2218612 painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead
2218613 even though a host of independent nonpartisan organizations have said this attack isnt true sen mccain continues to lie about sen obamas plan
2218614 im all in favor of inflating our tires dont get me wrong but thats a public service announcement its not an energy policy
2218615 he talked about energy independence yet he voted against ethanol subsidies and he is opposed to the farm bill
2218616 he talks about things that he doesnt back up that hes never backed up in his time in congress
2218617 i think for what we were asked to do i would say we made some plays but overall we left some out there we could have made
2218618 we drove down the field right away and put some points on the board that first drive
2218619 the offensive line did an unbelievable job i dont think i was touched one time
2218620 first preseason game first series youre kind of getting your feet under you and everything
2218621 really the first series of any game youre trying to get a feel for what theyre doing after that everything kind of settles down
2218622 he played fine and for what he was asked to do im sure hes going to be all right
2218623 i think he did good ive got to look at the film he can always get better
2218624 i made a few plays i made a few mistakes its training camp though youve just got to get better
2218625 i will try to serve you with dignity and honesty just like we ran this campaign
2218626 i knew the time was right and i felt i was the right person to do it
2218627 ive been to d c several times with my sister for school davis kind of gave us a cold shoulder
2218628 i think your representative should take the time of day to come out and shake your hand i like roes people not politics platform
2218629 im here to report that tennessee and tennessee district 9 voted firmly for the post racial politics that has carried a new generation to power
2218630 merely states the facts i think the nation needs to know s complete record
2218631 this professor gets paid to do his job which is to teach therefore he has to do all that involves of that particular job ie checking spelling and correcting it if he doesnt do this how are his students supposed to learn from their mistakes in tests and essays spelling is vital to get a good mark of course spelling is important
2218632 i think that good spelling does matter because if you wanted to be a policeman or something youd have to go through a series of tests and if you didnt have the right spelling and grammar itd be less likely that youd get the job instead of a person that does care about their spelling and grammar
2218633 i think spelling is a vital part of all the languages if we dont spell words correctly then people get used to it so what they think are correct spellings are actually incorrect it really annoys me when a word is spelt wrong
2218634 of course spelling is important how could it not be the other day i picked a book up in the shop and read the back of it i noticed a spelling mistake and immediately put the book back down again the english language will become nothing if people keep coming up with nonsense like this
2218635 im awful at spelling and in english my grade is always low because of spelling errors
2218636 i think good spelling is important because when it comes to important tests like year nine sats you get marked on spelling so kids need to know what they are doing right and wrong
2218637 i think spelling matters but it sometimes gets on my nerves when i keep getting the same word wrong
2218638 i think that the odd spelling mistake here and there shouldnt matter but important words like days of the week and months should
2218639 i think that as long as you write something good it wont matter about the spelling
2218640 if a word is spelt wrong but you can read it its fine
2218641 lots of people have trouble spelling and i am one of them my teacher knows and if i get spellings wrong she helps me with them since my class have been having weekly spelling tests my spelling has been a lot better so i think children need to learn spellings as it will help them read and then if they do get them wrong they should be told and helped to spell it correctly if they practise they will get better just like me
2218642 i think if people cant spell then they should get a dictionary out and find the correct spelling not just make up silly ones
2218643 i think spelling is important but it is hard for kids like me with dyslexia we should be given a longer time to learn the spellings
2218644 i dont think that bad spelling should be allowed it is a critical part of our education and helps us in many aspects of life
2218645 i think spelling is important but it shouldnt stop you from using words you dont know how to spell in your writing
2218646 no i do not think we should ditch the dictionary because when you are older if you make a spelling mistake in university people might point and laugh at you and think you might not have learned at school
2218647 i think that teachers should let you off the first time but if it becomes a habit then they should say something i mean they dont expect us to get every little spelling right do they
2218648 no as long as people understand what youre talking about it doesnt matter
2218649 i think that spelling plays a big part in schools so it is important to spell things right but tiny mistakes dont matter
2218650 spelling is very important where we would be if we were to write meet me shps l8r b thr plz i think teachers should make time for spelling lessons and should not put it aside like many do spelling is important
2218651 i am in secondary school now all we ever do is use computers so the computer changes the spelling for you so you dont need to know how to spell
2218652 im not a great speller but i still think that we should be able to do it in the future employers wont be impressed if we cant fill out a simple form without spelling something wrong
2218653 i think that the professor is talking absolute nonsense and that you shouldnt ignore bad spelling mistakes you should do your job and help kids learn the correct spellings the professor is a silly man
2218654 i dont think it really matters because in most tests you get the question correct if it looks like the answer
2218655 i think all pupils should have basic good spelling as in tests if people spell things wrong the words could be confused with other words and the question could be marked wrong when the answer was actually right
2218656 i believe that spelling doesnt matter i have this view because as long as the spelling is understandable then it is perfectly fine
2218657 if pupils get some spellings wrong it shouldnt matter but if they get them wrong often then they should get a list of words that they need to improve on so they can learn them
2218658 i think that even though spelling is very important the odd mistake should be allowed if a teacher can understand what a pupil is writing then they should correct it but not make a big deal about it
2218659 i think that teachers should correct pupils spelling as it will help them in later life if they are going for a job as teachers always say children should live to their full potential
2218660 it is stupid because how are you ever going to learn how to spell small words correctly if youre not being told that youre spelling them wrong
2218661 i think spelling is really important it comes under the category of english in my opinion one of the points of english is supposed to be spelling
2218662 i think that it depends on the word like if they spelt why as wie thats bad but if its a really hard word it shouldnt matter when i was in year five our teacher had to look a word up in the dictionary because it was in our spelling test
2218663 spelling doesnt matter and kids shouldnt worry about the smallest mistakes
2218664 i think good spelling is important but having tests every week isnt
2218665 i think that spelling doesnt really matter but your teacher should tell you what you got wrong so you dont learn the wrong spelling
2218666 i think its important to have good spelling as when you come to read youll struggle a lot more and if writers start to spell things wrong hardly anyone will be able to understand each others writing
2218667 i think if you get letters jumbled up you should get told for next time sometimes if people think they get lots of words wrong it stops them writing as much because they think they are just getting too many wrong and they get embarrassed
2218668 i think it does matter but teachers should not push kids as hard
2218669 some children find spelling really hard it should be about the content of the writing rather than about whether you can spell correctly
2218670 spelling does matter if you cant read or spell people might tease you or if you read a book you might not understand the whole book
2218671 i think that bad spelling shouldnt be allowed because when you get a job when youre older and you dont know how to spell something easy then you will feel very embarrassed
2218672 i dont think that people should make such a big deal of spelling so long as the words make sense i think that it is perfectly reasonable to misspell words slightly
2218673 bad spelling should be corrected because if your teacher does not correct your error you will never learn i found spelling hard as well but practice makes perfect
2218674 it does because imagine when you grow up you wont know anything
2218675 i think good spelling is really cool if we all dont learn to spell properly books will be really hard to read
2218676 i think spelling does matter because you will need it when youre older the occasional mistake doesnt matter when youre older and you make a mistake in spelling its probably a bit embarrassing
2218677 i think its ok to have a spelling or two wrong when youre just doing rough work but if you are doing a formal essay or story i think your story should be correct
2218678 i think spelling words correctly is important and teachers should let us know when were spelling things incorrectly so we dont pick up bad habits
2218679 if you spell a word right it is easier to understand the meaning
2218680 bad spelling doesnt matter people dont need good spelling its the knowledge they need
2218681 i think it does matter because if you spell a word wrong you might forget what it says
2218682 i dont think it matters but you have to be able to read it
2218683 i honestly want to be an author when i grow up and i think spelling is very very important
2218684 spelling doesnt matter to me as i get half my words wrong anyway
2218685 spelling isnt the most important subject but it will help you get a job when you are older because you wont be able to write a cv in text form
2218686 good spelling does count because if someone wrote a book and made a spelling error then you wouldnt be able to understand
2218687 of course spelling matters imagine a world where everyone mis spelt things it would be chaos
2218688 i think bad spelling should be allowed with longer words that are more difficult but should try to be stopped with smaller words
2218689 i think spelling should not matter because rubbing out wastes time and teachers go mad
2218690 i think good spelling does matter because in the future most jobs include english so you need to know how to write
2218691 i think poor spelling should be allowed because it did not stop my daddy being successful
2218692 i think spelling is really important because when you are older and want a job and send an application form the spelling wont be good and you most likely wont get the job people should learn how to spell properly
2218693 good spelling matters but some just cant grasp it as easily as others
2218694 well you need to be a good speller for pretty much anything because it can affect your schoolwork and tests
2218695 i spell correctly most of the time only when im rushing do i make a mistake
2218696 it doesnt matter about your spelling just as long you can write and read
2218697 spelling does matter it helps you to write and read so you should think about it
2218698 i think spelling is important depending on the career you cant grow up to be a teacher and not even know how to spell wednesday or basic words like that
2218699 i am quite good at spelling i dont think it is fair that other people can get away with it
2218700 it does matter because people otherwise dont know what you are writing
2218701 it is so dumb if its right its right if its wrong its wrong you will never learn if you get away with it i can spell basic words and am only 11
2218702 i can spell exceptionally hard words i suppose its just a skill really so this isnt exactly an issue for me but i think spelling is important and it is a disgrace that a professor of high esteem will just pass it off as being another mistake the children of today know nothing about spelling because they are not taught properly in the first place we need better teachers i was home educated by my mum so thats why i can spell conflagration and intuition things like that
2218703 instead of calling on his friends and allies in congress to return to put a much needed energy policy in place to fight sky high gas prices is joining them with a beach vacation of his own
2218704 some of those undecided middle class voters or even working class voters who didnt go for obama in places like and ohio wont like images of obama on the beaches of the ultimate luxury destination
2218705 during the middle of a campaign you are always worried about taking some time off thats the nature of the job
2218706 he has that reputation in the nfl as a fierce pass rusher for a reason
2218707 its one of those things as a defensive lineman you like it when you rush four
2218708 if we rush four i feel like we need to force the quarterback to either get rid of the ball quick or get a sack it isnt always going to be a sack or a play like that but you just dont want him to sit back there and hold the ball and pick apart our secondary
2218709 as a complete player you want to do a good job against the run and the pass
2218710 its football season this is the time in training camp where were putting in the fundamentals that are going to take us through the regular season
2218711 it was like cranking the car up and pushing the motor out a little bit
2218712 we want to stop the run with our front seven and we want to rush the passer with our front four
2218713 you have a good defense when you can do that and allow other people to do other things
2218714 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough
2218715 this ad is a lie and its part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam even though a host of independent nonpartisan organizations have said this attack isnt true
2218716 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2218717 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2218718 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2218719 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2218720 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2218721 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal
2218722 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against with the 50 states
2218723 see richard doesnt really mean what he says its popular for him to say it thats the way he makes a living
2218724 same as some more of our black revolutionaries who make a living off of keeping things emotional
2218725 i dont think the majority of white people are thinking that way anymore
2218726 im concerned that once he gets in office that he wont be recognized as an
2218727 we dont need another politician in washington who puts self interest and political expediency ahead of problem solving
2218728 i will always always always put my country first i have done that from the time i was in prison and was offered a chance to go home before my comrades
2218729 i put my country first then and will continue to put country first
2218730 while theres no doubt has served his country with honor the agenda hes supported over the last eight years has not served the nation as well
2218731 i dont think its about its about making obama different foreign other
2218732 these people are running a bad version of the last campaign 2008 is not 2004
2218733 i said at that time i would much rather lose a political campaign than lose a war took a different path
2218734 when we didnt work as a team they broke us down we were a team and we had leaders
2218735 half a world away another kind of love of country john mccain shot down bayoneted tortured
2218736 whats most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2218737 painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2218738 we got out there and we couldnt really get anything going
2218739 we had some penalties and some miscommunication between me and chad jackson its one of those things where you try to go out in the first game and execute and we werent really able to do that tonight so as we move forward weve just got to get better and tighten up the screws
2218740 coach josh mcdaniels let me know if things break down you can use your legs a little bit and try to make some plays there
2218741 i just wanted to do anything i could to get the ball rolling there and get some points lamont ran the ball well down in the red zone and the offensive line got real physical and we punched it in on that one drive
2218742 he was looking at me the whole way and i broke on the ball when he let it go the first one was underthrown by cassel he threw it behind the receiver and i was right there
2218743 ive got to stay in there with him longer we had enough experience where i should have got that
2218744 the market place of ideas is going to be more superficial and unedifying than it already is
2218745 and now google has served notice that its 5 percent stake in the company is for the moment at least
2218746 i just wanted to say that this is one of the most delightful headlines ive ever read
2218747 its both its two great tastes in one it is indeed an overflowing craposphere
2218748 60 years ago record compaines paid djs to play their donated offerings and vola big business happened
2218749 personally i think that this is apples version of border control for access to the iphone
2218750 youre the new guy and everybody wants to see this and you have to prove this
2218751 its not like that now this year thats on someone else you dont like that attention because all attention isnt good attention
2218752 i definitely know a lot more than i did last year
2218753 what a difference a year makes i guess just being in the same system and understanding your job and being able to help some of the other guys
2218754 thats how it always is you want to get the best 11 people on the field in whatever kind of configuration it is
2218755 no one person is bigger than the team the team comes first whatever is best for the team well do
2218756 as long as im in between the lines im fine
2218757 ill let bill decide that he prefers he does all the preferring here
2218758 you do that by coming in and not trying to set expectations you dont come in here and say im going to do this im going to do that thats one thing you try not to ever do regardless of what your contract situation is
2218759 you just come in here and try to be like a finger
2218760 you try not to be the thumb you try to blend in people get excited at first because youre the new guy on the team and everything and thats great but at the same time you have to be humble and wear your humble pie t shirt and calm down it will go away
2218761 he shows us a lot in the meeting room on the white boards he knows his plays we have these little games we play with the routes and if you dont know it he makes sure you know it
2218762 man this dude is ridiculous i mean every day its something different
2218763 hes a big playmaker and i just try to do everything he does so i can be a playmaker too
2218764 we dont really look at him like that but when were all done playing football and look back and we played with randy moss were in the locker room with randy moss could crack on randy moss and he cracks on us its mind boggling
2218765 i havent played in a long time so i should get a lot of playing time and a lot of experience its been since my rookie year that ive really played like a game game im looking forward to it
2218766 i look at this as a different year a start all over year for me a new beginning for me
2218767 and i just hope to make the plays to contribute to the team
2218768 you really execute your offense because its not a very elaborate week of game planning
2218769 you just try to go out there and execute your plays you watch a little bit of film but were building to get ready for the season opener against kansas city
2218770 its a give and take so when you get ready for these games you just go out and you try to get ready as much as you can for your opponent and try to go out and execute your plays against the defense it might not always look good but at the same time thats what they want to see they just want to see you go out there and compete and run the offense
2218771 i remember i was nervous and the game was so much faster than college
2218772 you cant really imagine the tempo for the rookies and guys that its their first preseason game i can only imagine what theyre going through because there is so much youre trying to keep in your head and remember
2218773 youve been going against the same guys for the last two weeks and now you get a chance to go against somebody else under the lights your family is here your first nfl game there will be a lot of nervous energy so if they calm down and just play and let the game come to them everything will be good
2218774 i got horrible nasty looken boy ass picture the bottom
2218775 all i do is eat clif bars and climb rocks all day
2218776 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
2218777 its cool but its not everything i just wanna win
2218778 hell ill play for the head of the klan if he can get me a national championship
2218779 im glad ron dickerson had the chance to be an ineffectual head coach and lackluster leader of men and i hope obama gets the chance to be a failure disappointment as president just cause its a step towards the opportunities becoming less rare
2218780 when you put all that hard work into a pre season programme that lasts six weeks to play a game that matters always has a value and the players cant wait
2218781 every game is going to be a difficult one for yeovil town this season that is a fact
2218782 everybodys having sex on tv except for husbands and wives
2218783 happily never after how hollywood favors adultery and promiscuity over marital intimacy on prime time broadcast television
2218784 todays prime time television programming is not merely indifferent to the institution of marriage and the stabilizing role it plays in our society it seems to be actively seeking to undermine marriage by consistently painting it in a negative light
2218785 references to incest pedophilia partner swapping prostitution threesomes transsexuals transvestites bestiality and necrophilia combined outnumbered references to sex in marriage on nbc by a ratio of 27 1

2218790 how do you feel about showing that in its entirety
2218791 well again i havent seen the taped version yet so i cant tell you
2218792 introduces viewers to a world of drugs and sexual experimentation with the premise of open marriage at its core
2218793 it was a very interesting session i had no idea what he was talking about
2218794 i thought his advice was contradictory cause ive read his book

2218797 the judges will start convening in north hollywood at tv academy headquarters tomorrow to look at sample episodes of the comedy and drama series
2218798 theyre not going to stop the flight of those judges from those screening rooms to their home computers
2218799 i did not feel that i was given the material this season to warrant an emmy nomination and in an effort to maintain the integrity of the academy organization i withdrew my name from contention
2218800 in addition i did not want to potentially take away an opportunity from an actress who was given such material
2218801 an ungrateful slap in the face to the very writers responsible for her emmy win in the first place
2218802 need to watch what they say watch what they do
2218803 your child is three times as likely to hear about sex with pets corpses or someone elses wife on prime time broadcast tv as to see a happily married couple having a roll in the hay according to a new study by one of the self appointed television watchdog groups

2218808 we have not been able to replace the incomes lost when high paying manufacturing jobs were eliminated in the early part of this decade
2218809 we have gained some well paying jobs in the defense contracting industry but not enough to make up for the incomes that were lost the trend will not improve without more good paying jobs
2218810 we are clearly losing ground because we have lost a lot of technology jobs in recent years and those jobs are not easily replaced
2218811 technology jobs are now being created in biotechnology renewable energy and information technology for the internet we lack the research capabilities other communities have that attract those industries

2218824 no boss listens to what the master her manager they are so ah simply dangshazi
2218825 i have heard her complain about a while though they have a very bad mood i can not even come back to work one day listening to people complain did the same thing when the wallet and also when the punching bag
2218826 in the past i have encountered very bad bosses and this is only my suggestion finally your own size up situation and act accordingly
2218827 mean we do not want to continue with this topic
2218828 the best part is just the room its just so spacious everybody can do what they need to do without being crammed in in places like the locker room and the weight room its just very impressive
2218829 its probably the nicest facility ive ever been in national football league or college or whatever
2218830 the field was great everything about it was kind of fun and exciting
2218831 coach holmgren kind of reeled us all back in at the end in a real good way
2218832 he just said hey this is a great facility its the best in football youve earned it you deserve it its gonna help but this facility is not going to win one game
2218833 well its wonderful its a fabulous building and the fields are great
2218834 when i came in the league in san francisco as the 49ers quarterbacks coach in 1986 we had one field half of it was turf and half of it was grass
2218835 the players desks they were real school desks theyd stick to the players theyd walk to meetings with the desk attached to them
2218836 we have the best facility in football now and i want the players to enjoy it its really player friendly
2218837 but we cant get too caught up in it we still have a lot of work to do
2218838 its down to two candidates right now were going to let it play out
2218839 he called some of us and said hey im going to come over to the dorm and talk to you guys we thought that was weird
2218840 i dont know if it really sunk in with everybody
2218841 its not a good thing for him to be gone its not good for our team
2218842 hes a guy that never got any credit in fact if anything he got blame when he didnt deserve it
2218843 hes the definition of an offensive lineman he didnt do interviews he didnt want attention he just wanted to block somebody
2218844 weve had a very aggressive program creating awareness to make the environment suitable for everyone
2218845 there are those who wreck the game experience for someone else we still have work to do but the vast majority has a good experience
2218846 people should be able to sit anywhere and have a good experience were serious about it
2218847 if youre looking for a purely religious experience this is not the place to do it but there are people who come who overindulge and are boorish and wreck it for other folks its just not right
2218848 people on the weekends going to sporting events are certainly entitled to have a beer but is alcohol the fuel for the 12th man no i dont think that
2218849 cara has been instrumental in raising the bar on all the content and programming she has touched
2218850 cara has built strong relationships with our team partners and has been a solid representative of fsn in the community we wish her well in the future
2218851 well find out tonight hopefully what the playing time is going to be
2218852 if not ill pick up a newspaper tomorrow and find out how much im going to play
2218853 the thing about friday night is really to get some rhythm on offense to be able to move the ball to be able to run the ball against a very very good run defense team
2218854 you only have so many players so some guys are going to have to play longer
2218855 weve got a lot of guys whove never really played in games theyre going to get a chance to play with the first unit
2218856 every little thing he does hes getting coached by at least one person
2218857 its been a very tough challenge coming in and having to run with the no 1 line all the time
2218858 and now going against two of the best d tackles in the game its tough we realize its a challenge and were going to all do our part
2218859 im out here and ive got a great opportunity to make the team im just trying not to make the same mistake twice and i think ive done a pretty good job so far
2218860 but you never forget something like that its always going to stay in that special place in your stomach where you can bring it out when you need to
2218861 but when the times get tough and you get tired or its third and 3 you just remember that feeling of man lets get this done or lets get this first down and it gets real serious
2218862 i think every player has something that drives them to be the best they can be
2218863 hes going to get a real chance in the preseason to play a lot
2218864 he knows that so now he has to show i think hes fine i think hes improving his decision making is faster which had to happen and that comes with understanding what we do
2218865 and selfishly id like him to take the next step and then it frees me up to use seneca in other ways
2218866 hes a very smart guy and he wants to be a good player
2218867 but the system takes awhile to learn trent dilfer had a tough time with it matt had a little bit of a tough time with it but frye can definitely throw so well go from there
2218868 he really helped me get through the tough time when i first got here with the situation he was in when he first came to seattle everything happens for a reason and maybe i was just supposed to be out here
2218869 hell get his chance again im sure and when he does hell be more prepared to be successful just because hes older wiser stronger all those things
2218870 hes doing all the right stuff and guys really like him
2218871 its kind of different to not be dealing with family and ticket requests and everything that goes along with playing at home
2218872 out here you can just play football and its really kind of nice
2218873 one strobe coming from the left and to the rear of the match shutter was set to capture ambient flame

2218885 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2218886 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2218920 i welcome georgian president mikheil saakashvilis call for calm and restraint and strongly encourage south ossetians along with the russian peacekeepers who ostensibly maintain order in the area to bring an immediate end to the fighting
2218921 the world will be watching and expects russia to live up to its commitments
2218922 since the fall of the soviet union nearly two decades ago russia has intimidated its neighbors and tried to establish hegemony over former soviet states such as georgia and todays action is another manifestation of that
2218923 the international community should unequivocally demand that russia immediately withdraw its forces from georgian territory and should lead an effort to resolve the conflict in south ossetia and seek a broader peace where differences are addressed through negotiation not violence
2218924 ive been concerned about the russians for the last several years
2218925 theyre going through a dramatic change over there new leadership and appear to be insistent on flexing their muscles i would hope that they would respect the areas that were part of the former soviet republic respect the wishes of those local jurisdictions
2218926 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2218927 what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2218928 all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
2218929 we urge all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2218930 we are working on mediation efforts to secure a cease fire and we are urging the parties to restart their dialogue
2218931 i urge the georgians south ossetians and russians to cease fire end military action and stop further escalation

2218974 seriously folks dont burn your copies of the book return them
2218975 i think meyers fans would send a much more powerful message if instead of a book burning tour they staged a book returning tour
2218976 not only is this girl seriously melodramatic and clumsy shes the most weak willed and pathetic character ever written
2218977 she has said numerous times that she would simply die if edward ever left her its like her entire life revolves around him what are you trying to tell young women ms meyer dont girls have enough self esteem problems already should they really be reading books about a girl who has no life outside of her boyfriend a girl who readily admits that she would die if he were to ever leave her
2218978 i think most readers would have settled for maybe a surprise pregnancy at the end or something to that effect if meyer really wanted a baby in this story but the fact that it swallowed the whole plot just plain sucks
2218979 i was extremely disappointed with the fourth book i want my money back
2218980 this creepy anti abortion allegory quickly gets literal as the half vampire fetus starts killing bella from the inside out even as it breaks her ribs and sucked the life from her she proclaims i wont kill him but does she have to face the consequences of this choice no because vampire magic suddenly allows mother and father to hear the fetuss thoughts and to discover that it already loves them

2218987 he has dodged mortality by having all these affairs but for him to really commit is to commit to death
2218988 and in a sense quite beautifully i suppose its true when you truly see somebody with whom you are overjoyed at spending the rest of your life with whom you can see a great journey the end of that journey is death
2218989 so in a sense youre looking at your own mortality

2219032 scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
2219033 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time
2219034 love to cut rates it will depend on issues at the time
2219035 i say to the commercial banks in australia that they have a responsibility to ensure that action by the reserve bank is reflected in the interest rate posture adopted by those commercial banks mr rudd in beijing for the olympic games told reporters
2219036 working families and australian pensioners and carers are under financial pressure from rents from mortgages from all sorts of cost of living pressures and therefore if banks are not going to do the right thing then were trying to make it possible for customers to vote with their feet he said
2219037 obviously there are a number of factors that we have to consider at the time of making a rate move mrs kelly told investors today
2219038 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time
2219039 the strongest indication i can give you is that we want to pass on an interest rate cut if funding costs allow mr rowland said
2219040 at the end of the day were a commercial organisation
2219041 demand from china is softening so the oil price is coming down as the government in china and other emerging economies lift their subsidies and the high prices lead to lower consumption
2219042 once commodities go through that kind of a bubble and all of them have then the market pulls back and it returns to fundamentals now we have zinc and nickel prices hitting levels where mines have to close
2219043 there has been huge amount of speculative money going into oil and that was the reason for the sharp spike
2219044 remember when the china growth phenomenon first took off the whole commodities industry was geared to handle world demand growth of 1 2 per cent a year but then china came along and that increased to 3 4 per cent a year virtually doubling demand and we werent ready for it and couldnt handle it so prices rose
2219045 ive never known a commodity to be in surplus and still see its price rise

2219060 bad news in europe is good news for the dollar and bearish for commodities said phil flynn analyst at alaron trading
2219061 the markets are more focused on the dollar and its newfound strength oil is less looking at geopolitical risk and slowing demand risk mr flynn said
2219062 a few weeks ago when the markets mood was bullish oil would have soared on that pipeline news but supply worries have less impact when the focus and the mood is based on slowing demand

2219073 but hanging out with him outside of circus hes really funny he told us a couple of really funny jokes they were a little bit inappropriate for younger kids he comes out a little bit more
2219074 theyre bringing not only their own culture but the experience that they have coaching
2219075 it doesnt translate into the choreography or the theme of the show but it translates into the tricks and acts themselves and the level of training
2219076 on a day to day basis it doesnt really affect you because you come in and everyone is either a coach of you or a fellow student
2219077 we never really think of it in terms of cultures its just different styles of circus
2219078 its still hanging around the us120 level it has edged down a bit but thats just part of the volatility of the market said victor shum an analyst with energy consultancy purvin and gertz in singapore
2219079 supply side issues will continue to oppose the price slide while the concerns over slackening us demand will weigh down on prices
2219080 overall the market remains at a crossroad market participants are torn between persistent fears over slowing energy demand and potentials for further supply disruptions
2219081 the btc pipeline outage could last up to five weeks that represents a significant disruption to non opec supply mr shum said referring to the organisation of petroleum exporting countries
2219082 business as usual basis while sales of the various group businesses are pursued
2219083 it is the receivers intention that all current commander services will continue uninterrupted whilst the sale process is undertaken and that all commander customer needs continue to be serviced mcgrathnicol partner peter anderson said
2219084 there are no plans for major structural changes to the business while the sale process is underway
2219085 obviously there are a number of factors that we have to consider at the time of making a rate move chief executive gail kelly told investors today
2219086 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time
2219087 scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
2219088 theres no question that the operating environment that were working within has deteriorated at a more rapid rate than we anticipated at the half mrs kelly said
2219089 and weve seen the impact of higher interest rates higher oil prices and rising food prices on consumer discretionary spending
2219090 and this is reflected in lower consumer confidence weaker retail sales and softer business expectations
2219091 so all of this is resulting in system credit growth falling quite rapidly now down to an annualised rate of 5 6 per cent over the june quarter
2219092 and so were in the position where the reserve bank as flagged in their statement on tuesday is looking to ease monetary policy so quite a change from a few months ago
2219093 our local market seems to be buoyed by the prospect of a potential rate cut in september mr lewis said
2219094 if that happens it would be good for the equity markets
2219095 westpac gave out some very positive figures and the market liked it very reassuring for traders
2219096 we also saw continued strength in oil and gas producers including woodside petroleum which is not surprising considering we saw crude oil bounce off recent lows overnight

2219100 transformation and the associated cost savings when the company releases its 2007 08 results on august 13
2219101 these results are going to be less about 2008 and more about 2009 and 2010 abn amro equities analyst ian martin said
2219102 we will see how the timetable of the it transformation is going and how many customers have been moved onto the new system telstra is trying to become leaner

2219108 its the safe teddy bear stock in the world of financials
2219109 i think st george is a dead dragon he said
2219110 good with total written off items at similar levels to the first half
2219111 scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
2219112 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time
2219113 were holding up reasonably well at noon considering the weak start weve had and westpac doing well after it released some positive results today mr betts said referring to westpacs market update this morning
2219114 i expect the market to drift off as we head into the weekend
2219115 that has triggered a lot of selling and thats whats been dragging the australian dollar lower mr kyriakopoulos said
2219116 some of the euro weakness that has weighed on the australian dollar was a flow through from what we heard overnight from ecb president trichet
2219117 it could be the start of the process that the ecb moves from a tightening to an easing bias
2219118 i think to be called gothic belly dance it should consist of at least some moves derived or influenced from either tribal or cabaret
2219119 once you go too far outside the realm of bellydance
2219120 with a little booty hip hop to mix it up
2219121 zombies rule and the great thing is you dont have to even try to look glamorous
2219122 dies ist kein kampf gut gegen b se sondern wertsteigerung gegen wertvernichtung
2219123 die heutige hauptversammlung ist zu einer presse und pr schlacht geworden
2219124 wir w nschen uns in zukunft vor allem transparenz klare ziele klare zahlen
2219125 its still complications from the knee injury that forced her to pull out of wimbledon
2219126 theres concern about being able to play potentially 11 matches on it
2219127 we wanted to work out how we used the ball a bit better we ended up dumping the ball out to them and thatll happen in games like this
2219128 he looks great he was on the bench for a bit but hell get better as the games go on
2219129 i was very disappointed to read this in the newspaper
2219130 we just currently won an award for our community outreach meetings all about communication but not one resident in that access route through the city had been consulted
2219131 if there is global warming and if it is due to human activity then lets look at it more sensibly than saying were all doomed unless we as australians do something about it
2219132 my green credentials are just as good as anybodys im not a redneck suggesting we dont need to anything about our pollution but to say that australias pollution is having any impact on global warming if is exists is patently ridiculous
2219133 its unbelievable we have no town water and we rely entirely on the rain for our water supply
2219134 we are thrilled to be back and offering much needed affordable second hand clothing bric a brac linen electrical and furniture goods
2219135 the government says that it cant interfere and the matter is handled by the police that is right up to a point
2219136 all the government can do is determine the numbers in the force the police are left to allocate where so they have the authority to do what theyve done which is transfer the position of sergeant from crookwell to goulburn
2219137 our goal was to show that you could do good quality content for a reasonable amount of money its not amateur hour in the backyard but its not epic and unaffordable were counting on the fans to spread it around and make it an internet media event
2219138 but thats because they understand what im talking about i think generally speaking i dont have to over explain myself with them and the more people like that i have in my life the easier it is to accomplish these things
2219139 maybe nathan didnt have the professional training neil had as far as singing goes but he can sell it
2219140 everything had to happen in two weeks two to three weeks tops so we started thinking of the crew we liked to work with
2219141 and we pulled in a lot of favors a lot of people worked for a way reduced amount or nothing
2219142 can you think of a better thing to do with your life
2219143 some locations make their whole years worth of salary on rentals
2219144 joss comes from a tv background so he knows how to do a lot on a small budget
2219145 like on serenity he knew for some things he didnt need a whole ship just this one corner and he knows what he wants he walks on the set and in a couple of minutes he has the scene all blocked out other directors spend days if not weeks trying to block
2219146 hes at the top of his game so you have to be at the top of yours you cant deliver less you get a lot of surly negative people on movie sets screamers but his sets are always fun and enjoyable the people he attracts are good people and wicked talented so youre the best you can be even if youre supposed to be evil youll try to be the best damn evil person you can be
2219147 one of the things that parents whove lost a child fear is that their child will somehow be forgotten as life moves on as it inevitably must
2219148 we hope that you will feel all of amys spirit in the boat with each sweep of the oar and touch of the blade
2219149 the evidence before the court satisfies that the first defendant williams has failed to attend to his contractual responsibilities
2219150 there is evidence he has entered into a contract with the second defendant toulon and intends to play in a rugby match this evening
2219151 my conclusion is that the making of an interlocutory interim injunction will not be futile
2219152 orders of courts arent like referees telling players to stay on side
2219153 orders of courts are serious matters and people who are responsible comply with them we expect hell comply with it
2219154 i think we intend to do that as well its first versus second its going to be sold out
2219155 its going to be a great game a great spectacle im really looking forward to the game and im sure manly are too
2219156 early on in the year before we played them there was a lot of talk about it but we brushed it off
2219157 its going to be the same as this week well just go on theres still four more rounds after this one so were a long way out from the grand final
2219158 we move forward we open up the door for new young players it is fantastic
2219159 as regards the athletes we have a rule 51 where athletes cannot make political religious or commercial propaganda or demonstrations
2219160 they have to respect the countrys laws and there must be none in the stadia or the podium they can express their views in the mixed zone but not propaganda
2219161 they the athletes will have the right to be heard and then we will see what action has to be taken
2219162 it is very clear that whenever in another country one respects their laws
2219163 we the ioc respect freedom of speech but there are countries where you have to request permission from the police whether you can picket or have a rally
2219164 on the one hand for the rest of the world what china means to many people who did not really know it beforehand a country with 5 000 years of history tradition and culture
2219165 it will make those people understand china and vice versa
2219166 myself personally and the ioc feel the kind of excitement the athlete feels before the competition and that they have done all they could to get there
2219167 each games has a particular identity china will be opening them up to a fifth of the worlds population whereas in four years time in london it will be in the country that invented modern sport
2219168 yes i am disappointed that it still exists as i hate doping
2219169 but it would be wrong for us to be utopians
2219170 there will always be criminality in the world there are 500 million people practicing sports in the world and there are not 500 million saints
2219171 i have been outspoken about it and learnt a lot from my friend dick pound
2219172 i expect there to be between 30 40 positive tests based on an extrapolation from athens where there were 26 from 3 500 tests and here there will be 4 500
2219173 we have a massive belief in our group it is young it has been injured but we believe in what we have got
2219174 its a great day for racing and its great day for brisbane turf club
2219175 today i am delighted to announce that we have had our special general meeting and with a vote of 81 36 per cent the members have voted seriously in favour of merging with the queensland turf club
2219176 i practised on thursday for the first time in about four days and pulled up pretty well no swelling pain is a minimum so im pretty good
2219177 we like to be the underdogs it keeps us level headed
2219178 the way australia performs best is when no one gives us a chance
2219179 right now if we could perform it would do our domestic competition a huge service
2219180 again im really proud of the group of guys that we got the way that theyre playing and a lot of them are out of the domestic competition so its a really important time for australian basketball
2219181 it will be the perfect launching pad for my preparation for the australian open

2219202 if people were looking for this deal to turn things around for the market it certainly hasnt done that yet
2219203 this is the type of deal that has some components that could kick start the ipo market
2219204 i hope the rackspace deal gets the ball rolling again
2219205 the best deals can still go through in a bad market but ive seen some pretty solid deals that dont necessarily turn the market around i dont think one deal fixes everything
2219206 goldman could decide to lower the price because it compares better to competitors
2219207 its also very possible they may consider lowering the price to get a better pop especially considering the fact that the ipo market has been so poor that someone needs to stimulate it
2219208 i told her she was wonderful tonight and shes been wonderful all year
2219209 i thought it was one of the best performances weve had in 10 years
2219210 im not sure it was the best weve done but it was good
2219211 we put our best out there and it was amazing
2219212 i think they dealt with the difficulty and they went one
2219213 he has been very impressive whilst with us and i was keen to get him tied up
2219214 the legislation is an important recognition that gay lesbian bisexual and transgender students are often harassed at school
2219215 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform
2219216 he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible team on the field
2219217 brett has had a long and storied career in green bay and we owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude for everything he accomplished on the field and for the impact he made in the state
2219218 it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organisation forward in the most positive way possible
2219219 tra le luci di una serata distratta perdo anke te
2219220 cette pi ce a d tre fabriqu e par un professionnel le travail est impressionnant
2219221 we used to look forward to thursday evenings when a cart would bring handbills of forthcoming films and the entire village would crowd around
2219222 producers theatre owners and even actors like balan malayalam printed their own private stationery and used it to promote themselves or their film and whet the appetite for their forthcoming release
2219223 the practice of using a tandora to advertise a film was in practice in madurai town even until 1980
2219224 padmashree sivaji ganesan and padmashree vendam endra mgr mla the mgr who refused a padmashree
2219225 it was in this era when fans themselves became a medium of promotion
2219226 often the bringing of the print reel from the station to the theatre was a ritual and fans would line up for the procession the whole thing took on a festive air
2219227 its just the tip of the iceberg and once advertisers begin working on film trailers and publicity material it will be a spectacular show
2219228 television advertisement is the next big area and an ideal medium to break new ground
2219229 advertisements are all about leaving your mark and the coffee table book is one of kollywoods calling cards
2219230 what job would you do if you were for some reason prevented from doing what you do now
2219231 sie sind bereits seit dem 27 juli in peking was war der grund f r die fr he anreise
2219232 die klimatischen bedingungen ich habe bei der umstellung immer einige probleme daher haben wir entschieden die letzte vorbereitungszeit in peking zu machen es war die richtige entscheidung
2219233 sie wohnen im gegensatz zu 2000 in sydney und 2004 in athen erstmals im olympischen dorf wie ist ihr eindruck
2219234 es war der richtige schritt ins dorf zu ziehen vor acht jahren haben wir mit der gesamten mannschaft au erhalb gewohnt 2004 war es meine eigene entscheidung vielleicht war das ein fehler anm der red platz sieben der kontakt zu den anderen athleten ist klasse dabei wird man lockerer
2219235 basketball auf jeden fall und ich hoffe dass ich auch einige spiele der deutschen handballer sehen kann
2219236 kommen wir zu ihrem wettkampf sie reisen als wm f nfter an wie sind die erwartungen
2219237 ich bin gut im saft und versuche vorne anzugreifen aber olympia hat seine eigenen gesetze man muss von rennen zu rennen schauen konkrete ziele formuliere ich nicht aber wer mich kennt der wei was ich versuchen werde aber erstmal muss ich ins finale kommen dann mache ich drei kreuze
2219238 die blichen verd chtigen mit dem neuseel ndischen weltmeister mahe drysdale dem tschechischen wm zweiten ondrej synek und dem norwegischen olympiasieger olaf tufte hinzu kommen die einer aus gro britannien schweden der schweiz und den niederlanden
2219239 im vorfeld gab es diskussionen um die u eren bedingungen wie ist ihr eindruck
2219240 bisher ist es eigentlich kein gro es problem die einer rennen finden aber nachmittags statt da hoffe ich nat rlich dass die sonne nicht rauskommt
2219241 das ist eine strecke der superlative sie ist sehr breit so etwas habe ich noch nie gesehen
2219242 werden sie von ihrer familie und freunden bei den rennen unterst tzt
2219243 nein ich h tte keine zeit mich hier mit ihnen zu treffen ich will mich voll konzentrieren aber es gibt ja genug m glichkeiten um den kontakt nach hause zu halten
2219244 sie sind jetzt 31 jahre werden es ihre letzten olympischen spiele sein
2219245 wenn die bahn als mein arbeitgeber mitmacht will ich 2012 in london noch einmal starten ich bin bisher von schweren verletzungen verschont geblieben und z hle mich noch nicht zum alten eisen
2219246 im vorfeld der sommerspiele gab es beim deutschen ruderverband rger der achter wurde fast komplett umbesetzt belastet so ein vorgang auch ihre vorbereitung
2219247 da halte ich mich raus der verband hat mir das vertrauen geschenkt jetzt ist es meine aufgabe die 2000 meter schnell zu fahren
2219248 auch politische themen wurden vor den spielen viel diskutiert wie gehen sie damit um
2219249 das ist nicht meine aufgabe wenn der verband beschlossen h tte nicht nach peking zu reisen dann h tte ich das auch akzeptieren m ssen das kann ich nicht beeinflussen
2219250 they were the reason we bought this house because it had a big yard for them to run in
2219251 a competing vertically integrated model in which a single firm controls both the software and hardware elements of a product has been successful with certain consumer products such as personal computers mobile phones and digital music players
2219252 it is very clear that the senator has been used as a puppet to perpetuate opposition politics
2219253 we earlier thought he was mature in his assessment of kenyan and african politics
2219254 we have evidence that odm odingas party politicians and local leaders actively fomented some post election violence
2219255 in response to the revelations the evangelical alliance of kenya released a statement in which church leaders said raila in both mous comes across as a presumptive muslim president bent on forcing islamic law religion and culture down the throats of the kenyan people in total disregard of the constitutionally guaranteed rights of freedom of worship and equal protection of the law
2219256 concerns raised over alleged vow to enforce islamic law in kenya
2219257 in kimanthis view only some of the leaders were al queda sympathizers the renditions along with frequent police sweeps on the swahili coast had become an emotional issue in the presidential race islamic outrage had placed the incumbent kibaki on the defensive and provided raila odinga with a tool to rally the support of kenyas muslims
2219258 our government will not be held at ransom to extradite muslims to foreign lands
2219259 near daily conversations with the us ambassador and raila odinga
2219260 you might think that all kenyans would be vigorously supporting mr
2219261 this is what may be the most memorable effect of the odms odingas party post election campaign for state house the longer their protests last and the less disciplined they are or the more atrocities like eldoret church massacre are conducted in the partys name the more likely kenya is to be stuck on the front pages of the worlds media and the more embarrassment it will bring to the senator
2219262 you speak to and influence and connect with so many millions of people
2219263 i want to convey my respect for the idea i really feel the highest and best use of whatever talents and experiences ive gained in my life is to focus on trying to enlarge the political space within which elected officials and cabinet members address this
2219264 es sind t glich m hmaschinen im einsatz da sind keine probleme zu erwarten
2219265 obviously now theyre going to say were on top of this dont look at us
2219266 if this story hadnt run today what do you think the chances are those votes would have been stolen come november
2219267 en cuestiones de amor no resultan los actos m s convincentes que las palabras
2219268 how do you check whether the power steering is working
2219269 i say to the athletes these games were created for you
2219270 remember that you are role models for the youth of the world
2219271 it is fair to say that india would probably refuse to play against england with read in the team
2219272 it is fair to say that india would probably refuse to play against england with read in the team that threat should have nothing at all to do with englands selection policy
2219273 he helped raise awareness for others who were also in his position
2219274 he had incredible fight its so sad and very hard to put it into words about how upset we feel
2219275 hed done such a lot for the anthony nolan trust he was talking to the media about the requirements of leukaemia patients and the need for donors to come forward
2219276 i have reached the exceptional conclusion that immediate custody in your case is not the answer either from the publics point of view or the victims familys point of view or for any other purpose
2219277 it is clear that you were in the extremely bad company of fitzgerald and it would appear you were in the wrong place at the wrong time and it has to be said with the wrong person in the form of fitzgerald
2219278 i think it would not be right to impose a custodial sentence in this case and i fully realise this is an exceptional course to take
2219279 you was the one who killed him you can take all the blame for it or the same will happen to you and your mother when i get out
2219280 the court would urge you to take full advantage of this opportunity
2219281 it left us with financial problems and we had to let all our staff go except us and one other
2219282 we took out a huge loan and now just have the building i just feel so sad about it
2219283 sadly the chain has been broken now for the cherry tree there are only nine left and im devastated
2219284 it all seems so silly you see signs all over the place twinning towns with obscure places but you cant have a sign saying theres a nice pub down the lane
2219285 its more than just a pub its quite unique it was a post office and you could buy your groceries there it was very special to a lot of people
2219286 mr and mrs pocock chose to ignore our advice and consequently planning consent was refused
2219287 they were asked to remove their sign which again they refused to do
2219288 we had no choice but to take them to court to get our planning regulations enforced the court found in our favour which is proof that we acted correctly
2219289 wouldnt it be great to be able to play guitar hero on the drums
2219290 i wasnt born in wales and i come from an irish family so right from the beginning i kind of felt like i wasnt really truly welsh
2219291 i didnt really feel a part of it so i think thats part of natural human psychology perhaps to go the other way and reject something you dont feel a part of and thats kind of what happened
2219292 there are things that are hard about it the welsh language there are days when i feel when its difficult
2219293 but generally the improvement i have seen in the time that i have learned has just been amazing and its just been so much fun
2219294 i have just had so so much fun i met amazing people and its been the best thing i have ever done in my life
2219295 im going to be carrying on with it and then i would like to start on spanish and head over to patagonia and work in the welsh language schools and i would like to help other people
2219296 it is so completely possible to learn another language if you can learn as much as i have in 10 months
2219297 somali young people face particular problems in terms of their education and a lack of parental understanding to support their childrens education
2219298 somalis are acutely aware of the problems they face and feel strongly that more needs to be done to develop young somali people into adulthood
2219299 cwvys is delighted to work in partnership with sis to enable the views of somali young people to be heard to support their aspirations being realised and their positive contribution to the future of wales
2219300 everyone talks about his potential but how long do you keep talking about potential
2219301 jay has had the big flashy cars and needs some stability in his career he has moved about a lot but needs to settle down and play some football
2219302 ive seen the headlines and i want to prove people wrong by scoring goals consistently
2219303 i feel like im ready to settle down get my head down and do my talking on the pitch
2219304 we know he is a big strong quick player with some silky touches who can score goals but not as often as he should do
2219305 maybe hell find a home here at cardiff somewhere he can settle but we can only give him a stage the rest is up to him
2219306 i believe i have my strongest squad since i arrived here at cardiff three years ago
2219307 weve have good starts and good spells in season but have never had the depth to compete over a season
2219308 this year were more stable as a club weve strength in depth and we havent got to move people out to keep ourselves afloat
2219309 the championship gets harder every season because there are 17 or 18 clubs genuinely vying for the ultimate prize
2219310 but i feel if our squad perform to their potential we can be up there with the best of them
2219311 every club is pretty much the same in the championship this season except the six clubs in who are still getting parachute payments from the premier league they have an obvious financial advantage
2219312 even though a sense of adventure is a part of growing up parents should stress to their children that jumping on moving vehicles is unacceptable dangerous and potentially fatal
2219313 otherwise i would have had to go over the new bridge
2219314 jordan was a victim of that cocktail found in many of his age a thirst for adventure coupled with a complete lack of appreciation for danger and no thought of the risks or potential consequences of his escapade
2219315 we have heard of similar incidents to this case be it children car surfing train surfing bus surfing i have also heard of a case where children tied a skateboard to the back of a car its not a craze but we do hear of it happening from time to time
2219316 we want children to enjoy the summer holidays and in some respects it is good for them to have the occasional scrape
2219317 the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
2219318 theres a catharsis everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good
2219319 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what we are looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country and i think that people who supported a whole range of different candidates during the primaries are going to come out of that convention feeling absolutely determined that we have to take the white house back
2219320 i spoke to senator clinton this week shes campaigning for me in nevada and florida she is very enthusiastic about the need for a unified party i think we are going to have a terrific convention as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics of the four days our staffs are in communication my staff with senator clintons staff but i dont anticipate any problems
2219321 if the party is speaking about unity they the clinton delegates believe the only way to unify the party is actually allowing them to vote
2219322 moving beyond the convention if they were not allowed to vote there would be a lot of resentment
2219323 my conclusion is that the making of an interlocutory interim injunction will not be futile
2219324 the bulldogs will continue to stand up for whats right for the club and continue to stand up for the principle and sanctity of the contract
2219325 im no coward you know i stood up for myself and i stood up for player rights
2219326 thats not a coward act thats showing some balls to really stand up and show that we dont have to cop that we can get what we deserve
2219327 i dont know if all of this will work i have to say that i have to give you straight talk i do
2219328 i cant assure you that this train wreck isnt going to happen but i will do everything in my power to see that we avert it
2219329 my straight talk would be please dont let this foreign company ruin our part of the world
2219330 im personally calling on john mccain to send rick davis to germany to use his considerable clout with dhl to help save these 8 200 jobs in southwest ohio
2219331 come here to wilmington and come here to ohio and explain the reasons and rationale for their decision
2219332 this congress has been very focused on the gulf region and we remain committed to working with our state and local partners to see the rebuilding effort through to the finish
2219333 while the recovery is ongoing i am eager to see firsthand the progress we are making and to meet with officials on our strategy moving forward
2219334 is now able to destroy their opponents attack and defense systems
2219335 its a completely different approach we have video specialists as part of the team so now there is this culture of the video statistic
2219336 you can guarantee that more of these will become common in future elections
2219337 more than likely the people who do this are the extremists or people who are in it for a profit campaigns need to become more aware of these kinds of attacks
2219338 campaigns are spending a lot on online advertising and some of this money is really being misspent and going to typo squatters
2219339 website poked fun at her and other candidates by depicting them as characters from
2219340 if i want to attack supporters of a particular campaign i can easily put malware on my site
2219341 you can target candidates cause confusion pop up ads or re direct computers when they try to log on to a candidates website
2219342 this is a serious problem that spans not only campaigns but every company with email
2219343 for now handsets makers are under a lot of pressure to reduce their prices as operators do not want to increase subsidy which is a high cost for them already
2219344 sure doing more with your phone appeals to a segment of the market
2219345 but there is a segment though that just wants simplicity and lower cost even when looking for performance people are rarely willing to compromise on style
2219346 which is rather easier to remember than an ip address such as 66 230 200 100 people take advantage of this when they recite meaningful e mail addresses without caring how the machine will actually locate them
2219347 the course is 7 500 yards long the greens are firm and the pins are tucked away
2219348 they are sucking the fun out of the major championships when you set it up like that the fairways are narrow and unfortunately if you miss the semi rough by a foot you are worse off than if you miss by 20 yards i asked my partners geoff ogilvy and zach johnson if i was out of order and they said no if you are slightly off line you are crucified it is too thick around the greens as well it takes the skill away from chipping
2219349 i cant think of a reason why they would do it other than to irritate the players
2219350 the rough is five inches long why brush it back at us it makes no sense people want to see birdies and they have not seen me make any i cant see anything wrong with being 9 or 10 under par for the week
2219351 i think our no 1 objective is to get more u s tournaments with full fields
2219352 therefore these patches show promise as a potential therapy for men with prostate cancer

2219354 stop copying 2001 windows thats not where the usability action is
2219355 theres got to be more ive got this lingering feeling that open source has not done enough

2219359 mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq mccain was so right that among military experts today the emerging conventional wisdom about bushs current surge is that if had occurred back then when mccain wanted it and the political will existed in this country to support it for the necessary number of years it might well have succeeded
2219360 everyone is convinced coalition forces are going to leave and they are saying we do not want al qaeda to take control of the area when that happens
2219361 pcs are the hidden energy hogs of the home and most users have no idea that they are needlessly throwing away 80 percent of their pcs energy
2219362 if just 1 percent of all pcs used edison we could potentially reduce environmental impacts by 7 billion pounds of co2 which is equal to taking more than a half million cars off the road by finding ways to embed offsets in our daily life even something as simple as downloading software we will create permanent reductions in energy use and have a huge impact on our environment and resource sustainability
2219363 sales during the quarter were particularly strong in the u s higher education market and once again we experienced increased demand for our managed hosting services
2219364 mccain he wants to raise your taxes to pay for bigger government weve been doing that for years and it hasnt worked
2219365 it marks our transition from a successful start up in the emerging field of cell phone recycling into the undisputed global leader in electronics sustainability
2219366 our goal was to develop a profitable company that was socially and environmentally responsible
2219367 with igcs support and investment we will dramatically expand the company and set the standard for success in electronics sustainability and clean tech operations
2219368 they have revolutionized the electronics sustainability industry by providing a convenient solution for consumers to recycle their used handsets while at the same time extracting enough value from these phones to build a successful business
2219369 we chose to partner with igc because of their deep knowledge of the sector their experience with growth stage companies and the value they can bring through rich networks in the recellular plans to e xpand its operations opening new office facilities consolidating processing facilities and significantly increasing the number of
2219370 why the heck would someone break a tree down just to steal a bike
2219371 i felt confused as to why someone would break down a tree to take a bike
2219372 this rapidly expanding sector is particularly attractive to international investors
2219373 a dozen projects have been identified not including energy production by invest in france agency monitors four of these investment projects are led by foreign companies wellman france recyclage at through its subsidiary valorga a global leader in the field of methanization plant construction
2219374 in traditional desktop and notebook platforms growth there is going to be tepid
2219375 dont ever make me open a terminal window and access a command prompt
2219376 looking at the business offering one of the things we continue to look at on a regular basis is price
2219377 i guess the short answer is can we change the ui and apps and not just cost down
2219378 how do we tell consumers and tell our partners on the hardware side how it fits into the ecosystem
2219379 ultimately this tool will make it easier for state policymakers to set a baseline grounded in current realities and plot a course towards ciwmbs zero waste goal
2219380 while scripts from the internet can be useful this script can potentially harm your computer
2219381 as part of the health services management of the outbreak we are restricting visitors to the ward and encouraging staff to be vigilant with hand hygiene
2219382 it is highly infectious and is most often spread through direct contact with an infected person
2219383 the most effective way to avoid viral gastroenteritis is to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and running water for 10 seconds before handling and eating food and always wash your hands after using the toilet
2219384 if you or your family contract gastroenteritis it is very important for you to stay home from school or work if your work involves handling food or looking after children the elderly or patients do not return to work until 48 hours after symptoms have stopped
2219385 we also urge infected people not to prepare food for others until at least 48 hours after they have completely recovered
2219386 if students say school is boring then we need to think about activities that are deep and complex and encourage working in a group and thinking to solve problems
2219387 if students are spending long periods playing games outside school than we need to ask why and what are they getting out of it
2219388 teachers need to reflect on whether the students have the opportunity to demonstrate the depth of skill and knowledge that they bring to a task or are we underestimating their depth of knowledge and capacity to a task
2219389 we are all computer users but if we want our students to be able to control their world than they need to be able to know how it works and be able to make applications and programs
2219390 the upkeep of public schools in the dubbo region is a basic state government responsibility and just another one that morris iemma has failed on
2219391 at a time that cost of living pressures are hurting local families local p and cs shouldnt be forced to get parents to dip into their pockets to fund basic school maintenance
2219392 maintenance is an ongoing process but last financial year dubbo received 464 932 to carry out extra maintenance projects
2219393 in addition the region received 6 4 million to carry out major capital works projects
2219394 statewide funding for education and training this year is 11 8 billion an increase of 614 million on last years budget
2219395 schools in the local area have recently received a total of 200 000 for six projects as part of the iemma governments joint funding program
2219396 through the program funding is provided usually on a dollar for dollar basis for projects which schools identify as a local priority
2219397 its sad because some of these young people are enormously keen to be part of the workforce mrs reynolds said
2219398 struggling with numeracy and literacy is a real handicap i know this only too well because my father didnt learn to read and write properly as a child
2219399 its estimated 140 000 extra megalitres of water are needed if there is any chance of saving the marshes she said
2219400 the government must buy a far greater number of water licences and act to crack down on activities like illegal floodplain harvesting which is stopping water reaching the wetlands
2219401 returning water to the macquarie marshes is sadly just theoretical until it rains and theres a major inflow into the macquarie system she said
2219402 protecting the marshes requires aerial surveillance and spot checks of environmental flows to ensure they get where they are needed
2219403 there arent too many buildings unoccupied at the moment which is a good sign
2219404 obviously we would like to see all of the buildings full but the level of occupancy we have at the moment is good there is no real concern
2219405 its actually good to see such a low number of empty buildings because the economic climate at the moment isnt the best
2219406 it fronts onto two streets and is right in the middle of the cbd
2219407 the tax is either 10 or 15 per cent of the full adult fare for the equivalent journey whichever total is highest when using the so called free travel voucher
2219408 pensioner booking tax has gouged millions from our older residents while services continue to decline
2219409 we must strongly support our senior citizens that rely on the regional rail network to visit relatives and friends and to meet important appointments
2219410 its like we are the forgotten race because pensioners dont have the finance to put towards travel costs
2219411 i dont know how long it has been since the government gave pensioners an extra dollar for anything and in the last federal budget we were pretty hard done by too
2219412 its so frustrating and its so unfair we rely on travel to attend medical appointments visit family and stay connected
2219413 because many dialysis patients need to be in dubbo by eight oclock it puts a lot of strain on our service and drivers
2219414 more funding would mean more drivers and vehicles to be able to address the needs of other clients
2219415 its important to understand what is currently happening by speaking to people who use and manage wetland areas
2219416 once current practices and issues impacting on grazing in wetlands are identified the next step will be to provide access to resources and training to benefit wetland areas
2219417 we aim to work with primary producers to increase their flexibility in using wetlands and promote their environmental credentials
2219418 management of the invasive weed lippia has been identified as a major focus of the nsw wetland recovery program which will benefit both agriculture and the environment
2219419 we are also asking producers to identify their training needs so we can tailor programs such as nsw dpis prograze and paddock plants to meet their needs
2219420 we prefer to watch a good regional film with subtitles rather than a bad hindi movie i cant understand malayalam but i went for the film because it got great reviews

2219426 in this age of mergers and acquisitions in the paper industry having a contract protection clause is essential for workers and their communities
2219427 these clauses protect workers jobs wages and benefits and lend stability to the workplace and the community when a new owner comes in

2219433 an orchestrated dance of carefully worded statements heaps of innuendo and a staggering lack of real evidence all contorted to create the illusion of guilt
2219434 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
2219435 canceling it would have cost tens of thousands of dollars for republican candidates across the country
2219436 every day its a new day and with every new day theres a new opportunity
2219437 any vehicle whether it is a car hgv bicycle mobility scooter or motorcycle if not used safely and with consideration could cause considerable damage to the user or other people
2219438 these provisions will require that compensation rates be set without consideration of market conditions and will increase compensation budgets making it more difficult for agencies to absorb operating cuts
2219439 the most exciting part of this was to work with all the great people from varied backgrounds that helped me accomplish my goal
2219440 i like his grass roots approach to leading our country he is listening to the people and not to big money federal pacs and k street lobbyists he is pulling together a diverse coalition of people he is motivating parts of the citizenry that have become apathetic
2219441 big brown beat a second class field and was life and death to do it
2219442 hagels comment was one of the most widely quoted in the media he called the troop surge the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since vietnam
2219443 who are unhappy with obama possibly refining his iraq position
2219444 before he has even left before he has talked to general petraeus before he has seen the progress in iraq and before he has set foot in afghanistan for the first time in my experience fact finding missions usually work best the other way around first you assess the facts on the ground then you present a new strategy
2219445 it turns out that presumptive republican nominee sen john mccain has attended even fewer afghanistan related senate hearings over the past two years than obama s one which is a nice way of saying mccain r ariz the top republican on the senate armed service committee has attended zero of his committee s six hearings on afghanistan over the last two years
2219446 to me the purpose of this trip with hagel in particular will either be a
2219447 hopefully for the sake of all of us the surge is truly working and it will not be long until the various factions in iraq come together to form the type of government needed to take iraq into the future
2219448 the nay sayers i am sure would love nothing more than to see it all fail
2219449 derek so he may make changes that we dont like and we must therefore judge him now on those hypothetical changes he explicitly didnt make in his major foreign policy speech earlier this week
2219450 while many of the more strident antiwar people are uncomfortable with the realization that obama isnt one of them it doesnt reflect any actual change in obamas thinking or position its just a result of the shifting focus of the coverage surrounding him
2219451 the situation is improving because its obvious im going to win
2219452 the color green has a special place in islam it is used in the decoration of mosques the bindings of qurans the silken covers for the graves of sufi saints and in the flags of various muslim countries green has been associated with islam for many centuries
2219453 signifcant number of reeds rhode island constituents have roots in liberia
2219454 well you are right derek they have done absolutely nothing except posture and threaten as usual
2219455 i just remember vividly how it was returning home from vietnam many years ago as a veteran
2219456 did you hear the one about the woman who is attacked on the street by a gorilla beaten senseless raped repeatedly and left to die
2219457 as for the surge being a success yes the military has largely fulfilled its objectives
2219458 did you hear the one about the woman who is attacked on the street by a gorilla beaten senseless raped repeatedly and left to die
2219459 heres one thing you need to know about john mccain hes always been the coolest kid in school when he sits in the back of his campaign bus we reporters gather like kids in the cafeteria huddling around the star quarterback we ask him tough questions and we try to make him slip up but almost inevitably we come around to admiring him he is to put it simply cooler than us
2219460 the obama campaign has tried to cloak the illinois senators trip in some measure of secrecy for security reasons the white house state department and pentagon do not announce senior officials visits to iraq in advance
2219461 i believe that either today or tomorrow and im not privy to his schedule sen obama will be landing in iraq with some other senators
2219462 i am sure that sen obama is going to arrive in baghdad in a much much safer and secure environment than the one that he wouldve encountered before we started the surge
2219463 but thats ok i am not surprised that the vast majority of your like on this site do not speak out loudly against what he is doing
2219464 the muslims have said either we kneel or theyre going to kill us i dont intend to kneel and i dont advocate to anybody that we kneel and john doesnt advocate to anybody that we kneel
2219465 what is the meaning of the word aspirational and how does it differ from
2219466 satire like the new yorker cover can indeed be a powerful purveyor of ideas and while the editors say they were intending to ridicule the unfounded fears of conservatives it would seem to me that all they have really done is add significant weight to the very grains of truth they have now highlighted for nearly every voter in the entire country
2219467 did you hear the one about the woman who is attacked on the street by a gorilla beaten senseless raped repeatedly and left to die
2219468 in my experience fact finding missions usually work best the other way around first you assess the facts on the ground then you present a new strategy
2219469 http www politifact com truth o meter article 2007 oct 01 democrats race oppose iraq most the above sums it all up nicely i do believe derek if you want more examples just ask
2219470 both are trying to establish a default position that we are leaving iraq but both are trying to preserve their flexibility given the stakes we are dealing with
2219471 its not his liberal supporters who had a problem with the
2219472 john mccain loved america so much that for 100 years or more he sent thousands of americas precious sons and daughter to their deaths in iraq in a quixotic pursuit of non existent wmds
2219473 this improvement was primarily due to improved results at gulfstream park santa anita park and our real estate operations partially offset by disappointing results at the maryland jockey club
2219474 well i never said he never goes out with protection
2219475 the sources said the official congressional delegation trip known as a codel will occur around the time obama heads overseas for a previously announced campaign trip
2219476 i really do hope that iraq will not be another south vietnam
2219477 to use precise distinctions and subtlety in thought or speech
2219478 sen obama is trying to court republican votes and thats why hes not going with two democrats dont be deceived by politics
2219479 this is a very real responsible addressing of the most divisive issue in this country since vietnam yes sure its tough absolutely and i think all 100 senators ought to be on the line on this what do you believe what are you willing to support what do you think why were you elected if you wanted a safe job go sell shoes this is a tough business but is it any tougher us having to take a tough vote express ourselves and have the courage to step up on what were asking our young men and women to do
2219480 democratic presidential candidate barack obama had lunch today with a republican further fueling speculation that he might pick a republican as a running mate
2219481 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2219482 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2219483 i dont think too many people question that i think a lot of people question what happened this offseason
2219484 you see teams go out in free agency and spend on a lot of guys and everyone says oh theyre going to be great and go to the super bowl it takes chemistry and to me thats the most important thing you can have all the talent in the world but if the chemistry is not there it wont matter
2219485 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2219486 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2219487 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2219488 he still has the utmost amount of respect from the guys in this locker room here and we wish him well wish him a good season and hope to see him in tampa
2219489 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2219490 it is good to have him here when you play with a legend you cant help but feed off of it i think hell fit right in with both the team and the city
2219491 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year
2219492 i dont know if im being naive but i dont feel that way
2219493 i have done a bunch of interviews and they are like were you nervous to throw the ball or let it loose
2219494 when we started throwing nobody was around it wasnt like it was april and guys are working out or may and we have minicamp and im trying to push it i didnt have to push it because nobody was there so that worked in my favor
2219495 it always hurt to practice but it just didnt feel right
2219496 i remember vividly talking to my wife on a friday afternoon and she asked how was practice and how is the arm i said it was miserable this week i dont know it was just miserable this week your body just tells you sometimes
2219497 it felt too good after i hurt myself it sounds stupid but i didnt have the pain
2219498 i didnt have the pain during the night or waking up in the morning i didnt have the pain of when i would grab certain things i didnt have that anymore that was more mentally refreshing than anything else
2219499 i think most players ive seen as you get older you realize your years might be numbered
2219500 im not saying jake is done anytime soon but i think he knows hes comfortable here hes enjoying it his elbow feels good and hes definitely having a lot of fun
2219501 highlands and islands airports limited and dundee airport are committed to working with airlines to develop new scheduled routes for the city of dundee and surrounding regions
2219502 a direct link to amsterdam would be of enormous economic benefit to this area for business and leisure travel and is an important route development target for us
2219503 it seems that the local village hall committee has taken matters into their own hands and applied for planning permission to erect houses on the existing car park thereby closing what has become an established right of way and potentially causing major traffic problems on an adjoining service road
2219504 weve been in the process for about 11 years of trying to rebuild our village hall
2219505 its a big hall and a big project which will cost approximately 850 000
2219506 were looking at it as two games with balanced repetitions
2219507 there are a few plays i wish i could take back
2219508 he threw some nfl balls in there that ball across the middle in the fourth quarter was a heck of a throw he scrambled around and did a nice job
2219509 its very very important for myself and my development for the team
2219510 i havent stepped into the situation any day in practice saying my performance will help me or not help me
2219511 we have recently installed a turning area on the island side of the causeway to allow drivers to turn back when the causeway ahead is covered with water
2219512 we have also put up photo montages that show how dangerous it is to attempt to cross the causeway outside of safe crossing times
2219513 in the light if recent events we may have to consider the need for signs in other languages to be placed in the vicinity of the causeway
2219514 with the common efforts made both by china and the u s the sino u s relationship has developed steadily in the last few years the two countries have conducted fruitful talks communication and cooperation bilaterally and on a range of international issues facts prove again that although there are divergences between china and the u s there is a wide range of common interests and a basis for cooperation a good sino u s relationship is a benefit to the people of both countries and helps peace and stability in the asia pacific region and throughout the whole world we are willing to work together with the u s on strengthening dialogue and cooperation appropriately dealing with divergences and sensitive issues and helping the relations to develop constructively and stably the chinese government puts people first and is dedicated to maintaining and promoting its citizens basic rights and freedom chinese citizens have freedom of religion these are indisputable facts as for the divergence on human rights and religions we always advocate that both sides talk from a basis of mutual respect and equality to enhance understanding and diminish divergence and enlarge mutual consensus we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
2219515 there is no way the core infra structures of these buildings could be obliterated so wholly and completely without an extensive system of demolition aides detonated in a system or web of detonation systems in place
2219516 john mccain says we need offshore oil drilling and we need it now senator obamas solution to high gas prices is telling americans to make sure their tires are inflated
2219517 john mccain drilling where weve never drilled before drilling in all the virgin territories no virgin territory will be left unspoiled
2219518 with your handy dandy john mccain drill you can drill in the back yard you can drill in the ocean you can drill everywhere you can think of and before you know it you will be rich because as you know we all need oil
2219519 want to have the biggest sperm and tissue bank just the best
2219520 flies that lay eggs in your hair and then the larvae burrow into your scalp and grow maggots
2219521 and as we go through the preseason we will start a different quarterback in a different game
2219522 thats the plan right now were going to make sure that all of our guys have an opportunity to play with the first unit its an open competition for those guys and this will be the first opportunity for them
2219523 i think itll be a good test for our offense right now we just need to go out and compete i dont think it means anything weve got four quarterbacks here so you just go out and compete and see what happens
2219524 i think everybodys a little excited heading in to jacksonville
2219525 for me itll be good just to get one game under my belt and then ill start to feel more comfortable
2219526 i have all the respect in the world for chad as a person and a player
2219527 he gave his heart and soul to this organization for a long long time i really appreciate everything he has done
2219528 im happy with the people we have here right now
2219529 we have three quarterbacks right now on the team and were finding it hard right now to get all three of those guys the work they need but were doing that
2219530 prontos a devorar te com uma gana que s compreens vel em quem
2219531 rookies are fine and dandy and im glad to see them progressing but i dont fall in love with rookies
2219532 it aint the best there were some missed tackles there were some third down conversions there was some rushing yardage there was getting pushed around there were some snaps where we had people dogtrotting we did some things we werent very proud of
2219533 we were glad to win the ballgame but by no stretch of the imagination was that a work of art their backups just played a little bit worse than our backups
2219534 we will get to see guys under the big lights
2219535 we will get to see guys we havent seen at this level in an nfl exhibition game its probably as fast as any game they will ever play so we get to see the young guys in that situation
2219536 im looking to try to get back in a game situation
2219537 putting on a game jersey and getting back into the flow of things seeing a lot of different coverages a lot of things that we havent seen yet so far in camp and a lot of different looks that we have to get used to in the regular season
2219538 weve got some stuff we want to take the next step toward
2219539 were not going to reinvent the offense in a week but we are going to take some steps
2219540 this is like buddy holly the day the music died it is sad for all sports fans because this guy was not done it is not that he was hanging on
2219541 this is in many ways sad that this is where it came to at the end of the day though we felt like i think all the parties involved felt like it was the best solution to a very difficult situation
2219542 but the relationship got to the point where it couldnt go forward dont try to blame either side its like a marriage that ends it happens and neither party is at fault but you move forward
2219543 i think were all sad to see brett favres career as a packer end but we are glad that this matter has come to closure in a way thats good for the team and good for brett
2219544 i was just looking for him to tell me that he was ready to play for the green bay packers
2219545 and if we would have got to that point then our conversation would have continued and it did not get to that point
2219546 despite opinions to the contrary i like brett a lot
2219547 id love to see him have the time of his life
2219548 i told him he could help with the quarterbacks but i dont want any new plays
2219549 this is important to him he recognizes that when you step out of whats happened and everything he has a very positive opinion about the fans the experience hes had with his family he didnt want to do this to his teammates any more he felt it clearly went on long enough
2219550 theres always a bull market somewhere and i will try to find it for you
2219551 this is a case example of how the board apparently found their man and the candidate was then able to negotiate a very rich agreement
2219552 he clearly is interested in not just being a co ceo but in being the ceo of the spin off
2219553 understandably he negotiated protection in the event the spin off doesnt occur which is primarily outside his decision
2219554 you have to look at the fact that this is a 22 billion division and in the last ten years this brand has lost a lot of position on a global level
2219555 designed to strongly align jhas interests with those of the shareholders
2219556 we believe sanjay will help to crystallize motorolas strategy refocus the company on profitable growth and help build a solid handset portfolio
2219557 you can handicap it all you like but the situation is tenuous at best it may not be desperate but its going to take a lot of work
2219558 i am really excited for the olympics my home country is the uk so i am rooting for the uk or the usa
2219559 this segment is one of the fastest growing in america and represents a significant consumer force
2219560 they have the highest incomes are the most educated highly professional and geographically concentrated
2219561 i trust that he hamm made the right call for the team and im going to go with that and fill those shoes
2219562 it has been my dream since i was five years old to one day play in the olympics
2219563 im just happy to be playing for the u s at the games
2219564 i didnt mean to moo at you i meant to hit this button
2219565 great i gave some skinny girl an eating disorder i have to go back
2219566 fara dumnezeu fara credinta omul este un animal rational care vine de nicaieri si merge spre nicaieri
2219567 cand o femeie se culca singura e o rusine pentru toti barbatii
2219568 femeilor le trebuie o mana de barbat pe san si ti dau tot ce au
2219569 ei se descurca pe metru patrat mai bine decat noi pe hectare intregi

2219573 cand o sa ne luam ochii de pe ceas si o sa i mutam pe cer
2219574 fiintele de afara isi mutau privirile de la porc la om de la om la porc si din nou de la porc la om deja era imposibil sa mai spui care era care
2219575 dumnezeu este un pix magic care ne scrie raspunsul la toate intrebarile iar raiul este peretele pe care scrie
2219576 nu uita ca esti om de la munte oamenii de acolo urca incet dar sigur
2219577 cand nu are cu cine sa ia pranzul irena nu merge niciodata la restaurant unde singuratatea s ar asterne in fata ei pe scaunul gol si ar privi o
2219578 intr un tarziu vine si poezia dupa framantari de o noapte spre ziua pe la cantatul cocosilor de ziua ceva nou intreb incercanat nimic atunci de ce ai venit ca sa ti fac o viata mai frumoasa zice
2219579 nu spuneti niciodata nimanui nimic daca o faceti veti incepe sa pierdeti totul
2219580 viata trece pe langa majoritatea oamenilor in timp ce acestia isi fac planuri marete
2219581 orice umor de calitate incepe prin aceea ca nu ti mai iei in serios prorpia persoana
2219582 fericirea este de un singur fel dar nefericirea e de o varietate infinita
2219583 lua un chibrit si se scarpina in ureche capul ii lua foc
2219584 noi cei de aici ne am luat papucii ca sa putem merge mai departe
2219585 nu poti face nici televiziune nici dragoste daca n ai o camera la dispozitie
2219586 e o falsa teorie ca barbatul cucereste femeia de fapt se intampla invers chiar daca lucrurile nu sunt atat de evidente ea alege ea cheama cucereste si domina
2219587 oamenii te iarta daca faci crime dar nu te iarta daca esti fericit
2219588 devii raspunzator pentru toata viata fata de ceea ce ai imblanzit
2219589 this is a way for people to cling on to a part of the life they once had

2219595 were used to the dea calling in help from various federal agencies and local law enforcement but i guess none of their usual buddies were available yesterday because from the picture below which appeared in the la times today it looks like they had to resort to calling in blackwater
2219596 are members of a disputed mercenary killer group now working with the dea a photo from the la times shows proof of one of two things either blackwater members are now working for the bush white houses drug enforcement agency or this semi illegitimate band of rogue federal cops have worse discipline than any of us ever imagined
2219597 they were also used in raids in humboldt county last month against the growers operation southern sweep cant find any news stories about it but some people i know have said they were using blackwater as well as dea agents

2219605 it is quite an honor to be introduced by your dad
2219606 i wasnt exactly sure what to say to you except to start with god i love our country and i love what we stand for and i love being with you

2219609 the cost of losing or compromising the integrity of pii is also leading to a renewed focus on information security

2219611 keeping on top of legislative and regulatory requirements is a critical responsibility made more difficult because compliance efforts are still operating in project mode and have not yet been embedded into business processes

2219613 this is an exciting development and one that addresses important e discovery challenges facing todays forensics professionals including processing speed and cost
2219614 the upcoming line of perlustro products which have integrated a newly designed platform of passware advanced decryption tools will provide forensically sound access to data and will do so more quickly and less expensively than competing technologies
2219615 working with passwares team we were able to create a cost effective solution that will dramatically increase the speed of every aspect of digital investigations
2219616 by combining perlustros revolutionary forensics toolset with the passware tools and with microsofts sql server 64 which is a critical component of perlustros ilook toolbase we created a truly winning combination and one that were excited to share with the government and commercial forensics community

2219625 i am still flying we live in san antonio texas and i fly for southwest airlines
2219626 i might move back when newberry is ready for its next world series run maybe bob and i could be coaches
2219627 you have really made my day i have wanted to get these down for some time just to review what that 1969 team accomplished during that season
2219628 that these guys are all about 51 52 years of age now but when i look at my books they are still those 11 12 year olds who took all of us on a wonderful run fred had managed the all star teams of 1965 and 67 and had the team in the playoffs carl hunter took them in 1968 but in every year they would get a good start but then get defeated once out of this area but not in 1969 they had the good start and then were able to play past those teams out west of here
2219629 we opened with wins over district 12 area one teams loyalsock 6 0 south 18 0 and montoursville 11 1
2219630 two things i had not ever seen before in little league baseball the kids defeated st theresa of pittsburgh 4 1 and i kid you not their pitcher remember now was to be not older than 12 had a light mustache and beard the next day we did a great job in beating levittown by a 6 2 score when the game ended their coach ran out to the mound picked don cohick up and swung him around in congratulating him for the way he pitched against his kids you dont see that too often
2219631 a kid by the name of hunter brett from smithtown new york had the kids down when a hard thunder storm stopped the game for some time it was the first time they were ever behind so it didnt look good but when the storm passed fred and jim had the kids ready to play and they came back to win it 8 4 to get into the world series later we learned that bretts mother had already booked rooms in williamsport for the series she was of course very upset
2219632 we will never forget the great reception given to the team on coming home city fire trucks and hundreds of fans greeted them out on the montgomery pike and escorted them to the field on arch street where they were given a great greeting the people of holy rosary church took care of feeding them it was a not to be forgotten evening
2219633 zomg i dont know what this is but i want more of it

2219638 i would like to try it and kind of switch it up
2219639 when i do the tour and stuff i would like to do maybe a section on the piano or on guitar or on drums
2219640 you know the jonas boys and people like demi lovato are my friends so i definitely would not copy or do anything that they did theyre really good obviously at what theyre doing so im going to let them have that but its also just kind of fun to learn things

2219651 all heads of department are urged to fully comply with the circular for attendance book to be kept at all departments all civil servants must sign the attendance book on arrival and departure
2219652 civil servants should realize that citizens are supreme and that they are accountable not only to meeting their expectations but also to ensure the judicious use of finances as well as non financial resources provided by taxpayers
2219653 with respect to the statutory requirement i have as on wednesday issued 1009 retirement letters to civil servants
2219654 out of the 15 612 civil servants 13 906 fall within grades 1 6 which shows that 89 of the entire civil service workforce is in the minor grades by implication 89 of our work force is either barely unskilled semi skilled or totally unskilled

2219658 it is a fantastic wicket to bat on there was hardly anything for the bowlers nothing for the fast bowlers and nothing for the spinners
2219659 it is just that we didnt bat well we should have got a much higher score than what we did
2219660 this is part and parcel of test cricket ups and downs happen it is important to win sessions
2219661 i still feel we in the game if we can have one or two early wickets we can be right back
2219662 for early wickets india will turn to their two fast bowlers both of whom did a fine job with the bat as well
2219663 at one stage we were 198 for nine and from there having a 50 run last wicket partnership they zaheer khan and ishant sharma got us slightly back
2219664 especially after picking up one wicket late in the day they have got us back in the game
2219665 its very difficult to answer this they are quality players its just that i am in good nick
2219666 i am really feeling good about my batting the important thing is to keep going out and doing it again and again this is what test cricket is all about
2219667 in the beginning i was a bit nervous as i am a newcomer also virender sehwag has been in good form as well
2219668 although i was nervous i managed to get sehwags wicket and that gave me more confidence
2219669 the religion has a temple at every node in the irrigation system
2219670 the priests make decisions and enforce the code of both religion and irrigation
2219671 im a believer that every thought we think and every feeling we feel is the result of activity in the brain
2219672 i think we follow the basic law of nature which is that were a bunch of chemical reactions running around in a bag
2219673 god is not something that can be demonstrated logically or rigorously
2219674 the idea of a god gene goes against all my personal theological convictions
2219675 you cant cut faith down to the lowest common denominator of genetic survival it shows the poverty of reductionist thinking
2219676 if theres a god theres a god just knowing what brain chemicals are involved in acknowledging that is not going to change the fact
2219677 yet they cannot fathom what god has done from beginning to end
2219678 this allows us to have the kind of experience described as religious ecstasy
2219679 a single change in a single base in the middle of the gene seemed directly related to the ability to feel self transcendence
2219680 if someone comes to you and says weve found the gene for x
2219681 you can stop them before they get to the end of the sentence
2219682 the spiritual gene helps establish a general trust in the universe a sense of openness and generosity
2219683 in india in buddhas time there were philosophers who said there was no soul the mind was just chemistry
2219684 the buddha disagreed with their extreme materialism but also rejected the absolute soul theologians
2219685 of course concepts of god reside in the brain they certainly dont reside in the toe
2219686 the question is to what is this wiring responsive why is it there
2219687 i think a lot of people make the mistake of thinking that if you explain something you explain it away i dont see that at all with religious experience
2219688 anticipation of our own demise is the price we pay for a highly developed frontal lobe
2219689 in many ways a god experience is a brilliant adaptation its a built in pacifier
2219690 you must understand religions very thoroughly in relation to their environments
2219691 and one problem for calvin was to make his city function
2219692 calvin had a reverence for the scriptures which then became institutionalized
2219693 the bible is concerned about justice for the poor equity and fairness and all of those things were seen to in calvins geneva
2219694 in order to survive you have to organize yourselves into a culture
2219695 religions represent an attempt to harness innate spirituality for organizational purposes not always good
2219696 my sense is that slowly and gradually out of a rich experience of the world one builds a faith
2219697 fortune includes the possibility of divine grace as well as environmental influences
2219698 the prison population is mushrooming out of control and the government is still trying hopelessly to build its way out of a crisis
2219699 it will take a concerted effort across government to reserve prison for those who have committed serious and violent crimes and to invest in drug treatment for addicts mental health and social care and enforced community work for petty offenders
2219700 the figures published by the ministry of justice and reproduced in part by the prt do not show any prison operating beyond the safe level agreed by prisons and area managers
2219701 we will always provide enough prison places for the most dangerous violent and persistent offenders
2219702 friendship is a plant of slow growth and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity before it is entitled to the appellation
2219703 do not condemn the judgment of another because it differs from your own you may both be wrong
2219704 what is important ultimately is the ability to deliver there are always bread and butter issues to be considered
2219705 elections are time bound and so the timeliness of the fund is important
2219706 if you used a government photocopier to print your campaign material that is abuse of incumbency
2219707 when you have an angel and the devil campaigning for the same office then you have a problem
2219708 if the npp wants us to discuss the issue of an extension there is an appropriate way of going about it
2219709 mommy cant that man go to jail for that why arent his kids in a car seat
2219710 dont worry about it if shes hungry shell cry for food
2219711 cause the doc said it so it must be true
2219712 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2219713 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2219714 for i know the plans i have for you declares the lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you a hope and a future jeremiah 29 11

2219720 it seemed to sum up what everyone struggling to come back after katrina was feeling i really wanted to bring the city together with that thought
2219721 folk tradition of adapting and transforming songs to serve as anthems to galvanize people in a cause
2219722 everything has changed since katrina even our neighborhoods arent familiar anymore
2219723 youre talking about kids who lost everything their homes their schools and friends
2219724 for some of these kids this music is all they really feel they have and they are very excited about this project

2219731 i so desire to have the pleasure of setting eyes on you once again pray do tell me your name
2219732 well dear marian this evening in greenwood you have won the heart of robin hood
2219733 you are young and do not know what is best for you
2219734 and if they kill me my life will be little loss to me for i am so unhappy in my heart
2219735 for if you try to rob me it will cost you your life
2219736 put down your sword for i mean you know harm i am just an innocent forester and i came here to mend my cabin
2219737 youre robin hood the notorious outlaw take one step closer and ill run you through
2219738 so much for his sweet words about winning his heart
2219739 calm yourself now time to stop fighting and be friends i could use a boy like you in my band of followers
2219740 our stories have bought harmony in place of strife on the back seats of cars all over the world next time you go away take storynory with you
2219741 god is looking for intercessors to stand in the gap on behalf of california and we who are believers are those intercessors
2219742 we as the church must repent for our attitudes toward the homosexual community and replace faultfinding with intercession it is also our responsibility to plead the blood of jesus over the innocent bloodshed of millions of unborn babies and intercede for those in authority to ignore the urgency of the times would be to stand by as this state is thrown in front of a spiritual freight train now is our time to fast and pray
2219743 and i saw thousands of the tiniest of lights these were intercessors meeting in small groups piercing the heavenlies then the brighter lights were fellowships of churches all across california and it was because of these ones that the judgment would be stayed and i saw a sign that read more time revival fire and the lord said a great grace shall arise from california that shall impact the north even to the state of washington
2219744 this is an extremely important event for god tv at this time when america faces a crucial election and especially with the current push to try and legitimize same sex marriage across the usa starting in california
2219745 it has been said as san francisco goes so goes california and as california goes so goes the nation there has never been a more crucial time for christians across the usa to pray into this situation and we believe we can gain the prayer support of millions more as we air this wake up call to believers on god tv around the world
2219746 according to scripture god doesnt do anything without first telling his servants
2219747 so that they can sound the alarm as they are led of the lord god tv has been raised up as an extraordinary prophetic platform for this time with a powerful ability to rally the body of christ like never before and now is the time to sound the alarm in san francisco we carry a great burden in our hearts for america and feel we must pray fervently for california right now
2219748 maybe foreigners can see through the olympics with their own eyes and hear with their own ears that we are a different china
2219749 its half and half everyone is very proud of having the olympics we want it to be the best ever for ourselves

2219963 like most first novels i suppose it was quite autobiographical not wholly but definitely drawing a lot on my own childhood and experience growing up in a small village and i sent it to an agent who really liked it but sent it back with some advice
2219964 i rewrote it according to what he suggested and then he didnt like it
2219965 the way you tell a story in a novel is very different from how you write a script
2219966 so in some ways it was almost like starting from scratch
2219967 also when i sit down to write something i prefer it to be done in one sitting the first draft at least i dont like leaving things
2219968 obviously with a novel you have to sit at your desk for a long time day after day after day
2219969 fictional people are so much easier to deal with in a lot of ways but then real people and how they behave are what feeds the fiction
2219970 it does me good to get out from behind the desk every now and then
2219971 i am the one who chooses to bear the name of the forbidden one as his call to arms
2219972 i am the one who bears the stigmata of the disgraceful and the lamentful one
2219973 it takes a lot of years to see what you love when you let go then you see what makes you happy you can figure out what the hell you are
2219974 i think this is close to what i wanted to do its very sustainable in the right place the right length and i like it
2219975 over the river and through the woods on sunday its music lucie therrien the next ed gerhard were also showcasing pat spaldings new work which is brilliant
2219976 last august i was as a fresh as a daisy this year i decided to direct right about now im melted down to just about zero and the season is just starting
2219977 i have minor concerns about holding up not fresh as a daisy this time
2219978 i was hoping to reunite wonderful actors from theatre by the sea but the concept was broad we could do art exhibitions concerts it was an artist collaborative
2219979 of pirates and poets a visit to the isles of shoals with celia thaxter
2219980 folks called and said we have a mailing but no theater
2219981 i did learn so much its one of those cases of what doesnt kill me makes me stronger it was an interesting time
2219982 you have to follow your bliss mine had always been intimate theater rather than big proscenium theater
2219983 i didnt know how i was going to do it because didnt have a theater but i wanted to do intimate theater
2219984 i love that theater its so intimate so inviting you can really make magic happen there it would be small enough that it wouldnt be exhausting like hampton had been and i wouldnt lose so much money anyway i though it was 47 seats instead of 700 so it was worth a try
2219985 my box office was a computer and a file box and cell phone and it all fit in a canvas bag
2219986 ive decided im not as deep philosophically as i would have always wished im not my conclusion is im a popularist i like pieces that make me laugh all the way through and give me a big lump in my throat and maybe tears at the end because ive learned and experienced something about life that makes my life better or fuller and thats what i love to do im not avant garde or cutting edge thats just not me
2219987 today we stand as a bold and prophetic witness against the tyranny and brutality by the chinese government against their own people as the summer olympics are being celebrated millions of christians and those with other faith traditions are routinely oppressed tortured and jailed by chinese officials it is a privilege and honor to be able to stand with those who are persecuted
2219988 china also promotes the barbaric practice of forced abortion and sterilization while those who speak out against human rights abuses by the chinese government are crushed and trampled and the peaceful citizens of tibet have been brutalized by chinese leaders
2219989 today we follow the teachings of jesus in matthew 25 and stand in solidarity with our oppressed chinese brothers and sisters our public witness is a visible reminder that 100 000 military troops and abusive security measures cannot silence the voice of freedom justice and the power of the gospel of christ the truth will always be heard and we hope that president bush will boldly speak out against these human rights abuses on his official visit to china during the olympics
2219990 we are willing to risk some minor hardship to provide this public witness for jesus christ and against the worst human rights abuses in the history of the world our prayer is our witness will stir christians across the world to take a public stand for jesus christ and his gospel of life
2219991 i brought a banner with me that reads jesus christ is king this banner summarized cardinal ignatius kungs heroic statement in 1955 before thousands of people in a stadium in shanghai when he cried out long live christ the king long live the pope he spent 30 years in prison for this powerful public witness for christ today we join with the witness of cardinal kung as we stand for life human rights and justice
2219992 end the brutality to those who are forced to go through forced abortions and have no voice we are your voice
2219993 the message of the gospel cannot be silenced the spirit of human dignity cannot be silenced
2219994 since their 11 am beijing time arrests on august 7 we have been unable to contact any of the group including my husband or support persons for over 14 hours now this is a bit disconcerting that no one can reach them
2219995 even more so we pray that this oppressive government will perhaps recognize through this incident that their own citizens deserve to have the basic human rights of free speech freedom to worship according to the dictates of their own conscience as well as the protection of the weakest members of society their precious unborn children that is the message that my husband and the others were simply trying to send they are not criminals i say china the eyes of the world are upon you if you want the respect and acceptance of other nations at this critical time during the olympics afford your own wonderful people the human rights they have been yearning for
2219996 when they exited into the baggage claim area and saw the three of us with signs cheering and clapping huge smiles appeared on their faces
2219997 i dont know what we wouldve done if you guys werent here we would be crying falling asleep and hungry on the side of the road
2219998 as christians we are called to take deliberate and significant measures to stop human rights abuses and stand up for the weak and vulnerable and that is exactly what these three have done were excited to have the privilege of being here and supporting and encouraging these heroes were thrilled that we were able to greet them and express our gratitude for their stepping out in faith and obedience to gods call
